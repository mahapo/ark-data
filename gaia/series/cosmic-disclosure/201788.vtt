>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:10%
we are talking about non-local
travel with Randy Veitenheimer.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.920 align:middle line:10%
Randy is an explorer
and a researcher

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.145 align:middle line:10%
of human consciousness
and existence.

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:84%
He also is a mentor
and colleague

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:90%
of mine for many years.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
Good to see you, Emery.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what is
non-local travel?

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Non-local travel means
that you're not in, number one,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And that gets into
defining what reality is.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.575 align:middle line:84%
What I did to be able
to understand this was I

00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:54.280 align:middle line:84%
aspected reality in
space and in time.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So I basically delineated space
into eight aspects and time

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:90%
into about 19.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:90%
And there's reasons for that.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:90%
But we won't get into those.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But also, the
reciprocal of those.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So there's kind of like
eight positive spaces, eight

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:90%
negative spaces.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Same thing on time, there's
time and negative time.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.800 align:middle line:90%
So that was one.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Number two, when I
started looking at that,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:90%
I was driving one day.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And I started
figuring out, well,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:84%
how many dimensions of space
am I traveling through.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I already had that answer
of eight dimensions of space.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought about, well,
what if I cut some of those

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.790 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:90%
And here we go.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So to test this theory
out, one night I

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:90%
was going to visit my daughter.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.850 align:middle line:90%
She lived 408 miles away.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:90%
And I was in a car.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And I left Oklahoma City
to drive to Shreveport,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and drive through
Dallas to Shreveport.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I called her at 7:14, and
I arrived in Shreveport

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:90%
at 11:14 or 11:15.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.180 align:middle line:84%
It was four hours and
one or two minutes later.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, driving a car 400
miles through that traffic

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.575 align:middle line:90%
and on that route is impossible.

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's impossible.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: It's just impossible.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I've
done that route.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Right.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And so, on the way back,
I didn't do what I did.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And it took the normal eight
hours or whatever of travel

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:90%
to return.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
playing with that.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And I found that I
could shorten times.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
shortening the distance.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a really strange phenomena.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:84%
But it plays into
some other things

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:90%
we're going to talk about.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, I went
to Sedona one time.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And I had somebody with me.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So I want to make sure
it wasn't just me.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And so her car got like
300 miles to a tank.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.120 align:middle line:84%
She knew this car
and everything.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
We were driving from
Sedona back to Oklahoma.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:90%
And I was explaining it to her.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And she goes,
that's not possible.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
let's just find out.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So when we got to
Albuquerque, which

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
is 258 miles or something, she
had about 5/8 of a tank of gas.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, I had a
physicist friend,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:90%
he said, you can't do that.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:84%
It goes against the laws
of conservation of energy

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:90%
and a few other things.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said, who's laws, right/
And so that's the problem.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.150 align:middle line:84%
We have laws of physics that
say you can't do things when

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.930 align:middle line:90%
those things are being done.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do we explain
that to the audience,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:90%
because I've been there myself.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:90%
You've trained me on this.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Usually during
emergency situation

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
or if I'm late for
work or something,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm really upset,
is where I can--

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.800 align:middle line:90%
it usually just comes about.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
But what's actually happening
to you, and the vehicle,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:90%
and your passenger?

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Well, a
couple of things.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you're not affecting
the local spacetime just

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.820 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:84%
You're actually-- the car and
everything else is moving,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.970 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it, or
the universe is

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.750 align:middle line:84%
moving in the reverse, whichever
way you want to look at it.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:90%
And so I would do it.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
like, blink your eyes

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and I would be 200
miles down the road.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I explored it
from a mathematical point

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and figured out I could
make an algorithm.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And I could create
a small device.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And that it would
play the algorithm.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And we could transition
space and not

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.490 align:middle line:90%
have to go through all of it.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.270 align:middle line:84%
We're so condition
that you have to go

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.078 align:middle line:84%
through feet and inches, feet
and miles, things like that.

00:04:41.078 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that's something
that I've played with

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:90%
and have some diagrams for.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's going on with
the vehicles around you though?

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: That's what's
interesting is you don't

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:90%
notice anything particularly.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
you're driving,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:84%
you see the road ahead,
and then you're driving,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:84%
you see the road ahead, but
you're not in the same place.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Exactly, right.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Do they do they see
anything, though?

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.143 align:middle line:90%
If there were--

00:05:07.143 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: I haven't
looked at that.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I haven't either, yeah.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: But one of the
things was, this is private.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
I taught it to the
physicist friend of mine.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:90%
And he went to Denver.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.565 align:middle line:84%
And it's a 10 hour drive
for what he was doing.

00:05:20.565 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I'm
going to try it.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And on the way back, it took
him five hours or six hours

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:90%
to get there.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So I can get about 33%
to 38% improvement.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:90%
I haven't pushed it.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
But that's something that
could be explored, because it's

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.620 align:middle line:90%
just entertainment right now.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:84%
But he calls me
up, says it works.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing it again
because it gave me a headache.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So I never experience
any headache or anything,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
but time dislocation can kind
of make you a little wobbly when

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:90%
you come out of it.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I've never experienced
that, but I've heard it.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.442 align:middle line:84%
And then, what's interesting
is, several years later, I

00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:84%
was studying with Dr.
David Hawkins in Sedona.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, you know,
space is not what we think.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.627 align:middle line:90%
And we can travel from--

00:06:03.627 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:90%
and he laid the whole thing out.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I was driving
down the road one night.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And like, I left Phoenix
and five minutes later, I

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:90%
was in Sedona.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you explain in
detail how you prep for jump?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: No, it's
using your mind

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:84%
to actually interact with the
universe in a focused, directed

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:90%
consciousness way.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Everybody talks about
being conscious or raising

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:90%
their consciousness.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And it literally
becomes more can you

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:90%
focus your consciousness?

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Can you become one minded as
the old zen term's for this.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you can
start affecting reality.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody talks
about, like, oh, you

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:90%
can create reality.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.467 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't.

00:06:50.467 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:90%
You don't have the energy.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the
focus, the concentration.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.732 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I go down a whole list.

00:06:54.732 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:90%
I did a little video on YouTube.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And it said, you left
these seven things out.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And everybody that
talks about it

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:90%
leaves those seven things out.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you kind of practice
those, you would get to a point

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
where you probably could
create some portion

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:90%
of your own reality.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I basically just
focus just for a few minutes

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:90%
and then I'm there.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.840 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty quick for me.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.012 align:middle line:84%
It took me a long time
though to get there.

00:07:19.012 --> 00:07:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And then it just
happened naturally

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
when I really
needed it, you know.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.988 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, it's just
for entertainment now.

00:07:23.988 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Or for me, I use
it for emergencies.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.868 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Yes, because there's
no authority you could go to

00:07:29.868 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:90%
and say, hey, look at me.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Look what I can do.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's kind of
like a circus trick.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is,
it gives us an ideal

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.340 align:middle line:84%
that everything from the reality
we experience, to propulsion

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:84%
systems, that maybe they're not
all playing in the right, area

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:84%
or the right dimensions, or
whichever aspects of space

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:90%
and time you want to use.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And just to open
that conversation

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.618 align:middle line:84%
opens up a whole
lot of potential.

00:07:56.618 --> 00:07:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Randy, moving
through dimensional space,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:90%
what is that like?

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Non-conscious,
that would be

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:90%
the easiest way to explain it.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And it also applies
to the phenomena

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:84%
of practicing this
little trick or whatever

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.055 align:middle line:90%
you want to call it.

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that happens is

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
you're sitting here, right here,
and if you were immediately

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
in, say a room down the
hall practicing this,

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.040 align:middle line:84%
you would experience
no transition.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that happened

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
times I did it is

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that there is some sense
that something's changed.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But you don't go
from here to there.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.520 align:middle line:90%
That goes out the window.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:90%
You go from here to here.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And the distance between here
and here has been altered.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Or you have altered
it, or space--

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.220 align:middle line:90%
the language falls apart in it.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:84%
That's the easiest
way to explain it.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.430 align:middle line:84%
But basically, you're not
transitioning through one inch,

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:90%
one foot, one mile, all that.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:84%
You're going, I'm here,
and then I'm there.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Another explanation I came
up with was a phenomena,

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
we'll say in quantum physics, if
I leave Denver to go to Dallas,

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm 100% here and
I'm in 0% in Dallas.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And we would think that
the transition would

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:84%
occur mechanically, like 99,
and Dallas would go up to 2.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we would be
100% there and 100% here.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So part of the work I did in
exploring this was that when

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
you leave Denver to go to
Dallas by your intention--

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:90%
here we go with that again--

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
but also with your action
and the amount of energy--

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:84%
remember the car, plane,
or whatever you're on--

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.800 align:middle line:84%
is that, at some point
20, 30, 40 miles out,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:84%
you're like 30%
or 40% in Dallas.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:84%
You have increased
your quantum potential

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.300 align:middle line:84%
to be in Dallas far beyond
where your location is.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's the phenomena
I was taking advantage

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.850 align:middle line:84%
of is that I could
step out there,

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and I could put myself at
80% in Dallas, 90% in Dallas,

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
while the intervening
distance would shrink,

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:90%
or go away, or not exist.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like I said,
the language goes crazy.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:12.768 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, it does.

00:10:12.768 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:90%
But you're already there.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Yes.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: See, and that's what
I think when I go somewhere.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm already there.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
cut for that gap.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Yes.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And like you
said, it has nothing

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:90%
to do with a measurement.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Right.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because you've
already intended to be there.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Well, and you have
also manipulated the spacetime

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.740 align:middle line:90%
or the fabric, or the--

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we'd have to sit
down and write it all out.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it's
just a phenomena.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:90%
And you can experience it.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was showing
my friend, when we drove,

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:90%
is that it wasn't just me.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't the only one
hallucinating that we had

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:90%
driven 300 miles with no gas.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like, when you
put gas in the tank

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and it takes two gallons to
get from Sedona to Albuquerque

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:84%
is like there's
something going on.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.218 align:middle line:90%
And I love science.

00:11:00.218 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
They'd go, well,
how did you do that?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.833 align:middle line:90%
And I go, well, you explain it.

00:11:03.833 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't have any
language for it either, right?

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's
no language for it.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: So that's where we
get experiential knowledge is

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I have experiential
knowledge of that.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
The doctor-- physicist
friend of mine, he has it.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:90%
You have it.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Hawkins has it.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Other people have
explained it, where

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:84%
they've woken up somewhere
other than where they started.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it's something,
like I said,

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I finally did enough
research on it

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:90%
to put it into a little device.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.813 align:middle line:90%
But I've not manufactured it.

00:11:32.813 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well,
that's interesting.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.310 align:middle line:84%
That's a great definition
for non-locality.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.870 align:middle line:90%
What about the portals though?

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.270 align:middle line:90%
You know, we're talking about--

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.070 align:middle line:84%
you've heard about
this in the projects.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's all
over the movies.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
people talking

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.600 align:middle line:84%
about the difference between
portals, and black holes,

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:90%
and all these different things.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk specifically
about portals.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about these?

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Well, you and I
both have been around some.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Just a couple.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: And yeah, to
me, they're entertaining.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
like the two-for-one

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:90%
we were playing with.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I really had fun
with the portal.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That was
the best time ever.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: You all
were laughing at me

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:84%
because I'd walk
forward 12 steps,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and walk backwards 12 steps,
and walk forward 12 steps,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:90%
and I'd stop in the middle.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.558 align:middle line:90%
And there was actually a breeze.

00:12:22.558 --> 00:12:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, I remember.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Now, 12 steps on
either end, there's no breeze.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Nothing.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: But you could
stop in the middle,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and you could see your
hair blow and feel that.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And so if we look at
the portal as a marker,

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:84%
you know, now we can ask
it at any time in history,

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:84%
due to fluctuations in
spacetime, was it also a gate?

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And if it was a
gate, then we could

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.830 align:middle line:84%
speculate that maybe
there's a reason that it

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:90%
goes back 18,000 years minimum.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we can explain why there's
structures, and sarcophagus,

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and equipment that has no
relation to anything we know.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:84%
But it could relate to that
portal being much larger

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and much having a greater
transference capacity.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's why--

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.758 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I thought maybe it
was the top of the portal

00:13:14.758 --> 00:13:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and the other part was
under the ground possibly.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: That could be true too.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.492 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What else
did you experience

00:13:20.492 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:84%
why you were in the
portal, besides the wind

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, it was very
misty in that one area, foggy.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Well, all
direction is gone.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, yes.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: I mean,
I had a compass.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I'd walk out, OK, I want
to walk 12 steps forward.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'm walking due west.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And I would get to 12 steps,
and no change of anything,

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.975 align:middle line:84%
and I would be facing
north-northwest.

00:13:45.975 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Or I'd be facing
south-southwest,

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.690 align:middle line:84%
depending on which
way I went into it

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
and which way I walk
backwards in it.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.175 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
walking through it,

00:13:54.175 --> 00:13:56.935 align:middle line:84%
remember when we talked
about driving down the road

00:13:56.935 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:90%
and losing 100 miles.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.935 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So just like that.

00:13:58.935 --> 00:14:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: There's just a
little bit of a shift, yeah.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But it's only
within like 12, 24 inches.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Yeah.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's a very-- so it's
actually the width of my feet.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Right.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: 3 feet--
less than 3 feet.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: And so
there is a little bit

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:90%
of a blurring or something.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this
transdimensional travel.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And if I said, well,
before I walked

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:84%
through that little
area, I was here.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the
other side, I was here.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
But during those 12 steps, I
can't tell you if I was here.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell you where I
was, because all your senses--

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.477 align:middle line:84%
even your magnetic
sense is gone.

00:14:40.477 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Like, right in the middle,
you couldn't tell which

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.118 align:middle line:90%
direction is which direction.

00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:84%
You literally couldn't
tell which was up or down.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about your mind and
thoughts while you're in there.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.662 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Well, I just thought
it was the funniest thing

00:14:51.662 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:90%
in the world, man.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.657 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're like a
little kid at the park there.

00:14:54.657 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Yeah, I was
having a great time.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, laughter
is also a symptom of fear,

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:90%
because it's the unknown.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:90%
So places like that--

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:08.980 align:middle line:84%
people don't realize the
reality of the Southwest--

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and I grew up way, way on the
middle of nowhere in Arizona

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.370 align:middle line:90%
as a kid and in New Mexico--

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and the reality of
those places is not

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the reality of the rest of
humanity in the United States.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
The things that go
on at night out there

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
are of much more of
a spiritual nature.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.450 align:middle line:90%
It's much more of a population.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there, is all
kinds of things going on.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:84%
The desert is not
quiet at night.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean that from
a physical, hearing sound.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: From a
transdimensional ---

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: From a
transdimensional realm,

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:84%
there's a party going is
the way I describe it.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think you see this
reflected in the Hopi

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.260 align:middle line:84%
culture and some of
the others, where

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to describe
the "kachina" or whatever--

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: "Kachina."

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY:
--pronunciation you use,

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying
to bring into reality

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.060 align:middle line:90%
what they're seeing.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's not crude.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.665 align:middle line:90%
It's not unrepresentative art.

00:16:09.665 --> 00:16:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
they're trying

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:84%
to bring in the aspects
and the information

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.950 align:middle line:84%
that that entity, or that
particular doll, or whatever--

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That ET astronaut.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Right.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.298 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to bring that
information into it too.

00:16:23.298 --> 00:16:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to bring
it in from a culture that's

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years old.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, the American
people tend to look at it

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and go, oh, yeah,
what a pretty object.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And to them, it's
much, much, more.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a portal in itself.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I would think,
because of all the native stuff

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:48.030 align:middle line:84%
we found near the portal area,
that maybe these beings were

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:52.020 align:middle line:84%
utilizing this portal to come
in and out of and converse

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:84%
or communicate with
these ancient tribes.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Well, and that
fits our mythology.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Our mythology is that we did
converse with the Star People,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.730 align:middle line:90%
that they did show up.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:84%
And then, you could say,
well, they came here in craft.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Or you could say, they just
walked out of a portal.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
fits with our mythology.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.589 align:middle line:84%
And of course, then science
says that that's not real

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:90%
because we can't do it.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's their metric.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.660 align:middle line:90%
If I can't do it, it's not real.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there a difference
between a man-made portal

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:90%
and a natural portal?

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: There would be
a quality difference.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:90%
It gets into calibration.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: A natural
portal, like when

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:84%
we were walking through,
you don't really

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:84%
have the experience
of anything--

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:84%
like, say, a little prismatic
effect or a little fogginess,

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:84%
or fading out of the
reality and fading back in,

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.070 align:middle line:90%
or snapping back in.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But on a man-made,
you're loading up

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:90%
the field with energy.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is things like HARP

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of other
experiments they've done,

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.370 align:middle line:84%
everything since the
Philadelphia Experiment.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:90%
But Tesla was playing with it.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows where
that research went.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
certainly there's

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:84%
a qualitative difference
to those fields.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where are these
natural portals located?

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way to
find these portals?

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, we
were on missions.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And we just happened to
stumble upon this one.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Right, right.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
ways to locate--

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Well, you have
to go through history.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
I love everybody
plays with pyramids.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
They'll give you all
kinds of information.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
But they never tell you
that the red granite

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and the water
underneath it creates

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:90%
an electromagnetic reaction.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.507 align:middle line:90%
So the pyramid is one thing.

00:18:56.507 --> 00:18:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And the base that sits on, the
red granite, and then the water

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.103 align:middle line:90%
aquifer underneath it.

00:19:01.103 --> 00:19:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a battery,
is what it amounts to.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability
to discharge energy.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to people
that use pyramid stuff.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And it makes one go
like, well, you don't

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:90%
have the complete picture.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the
complete thing.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:90%
But they have something.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:90%
So that's thousands years ago.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go to the Spanish.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
They would go wandering around--
and we don't know other than

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:90%
a little magnetic needle--

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:84%
but they would wander around
till they find these portals

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
because they were markers,
kind of like a landmark.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So we would go from mountain
to stream or whatever

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:90%
as landmarks.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:90%
They could go portal to portal.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the tendency was that
wherever there was a portal,

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:84%
they would be active in mining
or colonization or something.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.295 align:middle line:84%
Later we have that language,
well, it's ley lines.

00:19:49.295 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not exactly, right?

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:84%
But ley lines would
represent energy flows

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:90%
that are, say, non-local.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:90%
And so you combine all that.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can find through history
these things will happen.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.482 align:middle line:84%
One of my physicist friends,
we were wrestling around

00:20:05.482 --> 00:20:06.440 align:middle line:90%
with something one day.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well, you know,
the Earth's magnetic field

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and the moon's magnetic
field interact.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.080 align:middle line:90%
And I go, yeah, so what?

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, no.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:84%
He says, theoretically,
at certain times,

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:84%
you would have a spot wandering
around the Earth which

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:90%
was null gravity.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.927 align:middle line:84%
He said, you'd just
instantly be out in space.

00:20:27.927 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, we have
all those reports

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:84%
of people disappearing and
stuff and ships disappearing.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And I thought about that.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, that
makes a lot of sense.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.860 align:middle line:84%
If you had some
sort of lensing--

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.204 align:middle line:84%
gravitational lensing occur
between the Earth and the Moon,

00:20:43.204 --> 00:20:45.107 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so you could be
walking along and be--

00:20:45.107 --> 00:20:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's a focused point.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: --a million
miles out in space.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's another portal, OK?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's a gravitational
interaction.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they tracking this
all the time/ Or is that just,

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.288 align:middle line:90%
someone did just a few times.

00:20:58.288 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: You know, he and I
had that conversation in 1974.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And you know, here
it is 34 years later.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard
anybody talk about it.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing, like, you
find portals like we found,

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:90%
there's more.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Every state, I mean,
New Mexico has about 10,

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Oklahoma has four.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:90%
But what's that about?

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Texas has one, maybe it's
the underlying strata.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I think it's the
underlying strata, for sure.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Right.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Colorado has about 30.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.760 align:middle line:90%
So they exist here.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you go
looking at Spanish history,

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.770 align:middle line:90%
well, look where they went.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And you see where they
concentrated their efforts.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
it's part of their mythos

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
or part of their
technology that they use.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And they would use it to locate,
like I say, their gold mines

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:84%
or their settlements
and things like that.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:51.165 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How could we use it
today, these natural ones?

00:21:51.165 --> 00:21:53.632 align:middle line:90%
Or is it too dangerous?

00:21:53.632 --> 00:21:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: I don't think
they're dangerous,

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:84%
except that they can cause
kind of like a bi-location

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.847 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that your
consciousness while you're

00:22:04.847 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of it,
is not the same as when

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.670 align:middle line:90%
you're on either side.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And for our audience,
explain the bi-location--

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:90%
bi-locating.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Well, it's the same
phenomena of like, I'm here

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:90%
and I'm headed to Dallas.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here, and I'm
not in Dallas, right?

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'll use mile
markers, right?

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.690 align:middle line:90%
What mile marker are you at?

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And you could say, well, I'm
30 miles outside of Denver.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.565 align:middle line:84%
But in some sort of
reality I'm 120 miles.

00:22:30.565 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
phenomena of being

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.950 align:middle line:90%
able to go from here to there.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I kind
of maxed out at 38%

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.390 align:middle line:84%
on being able to compress
that timeline on it

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
by getting rid of the spatial
dimensions in between.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So this
is the non-local.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking physical,
so the audience knows,

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.220 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
you're in two spots

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.912 align:middle line:90%
at one time in the transition.

00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Right, you're
in the transition phase.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.027 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: And that's
why I say, you know,

00:22:55.027 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
about our colleges,

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.240 align:middle line:84%
they don't teach
transitional physics.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:90%
This is transitional physics.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk
about portals, we

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:84%
may be talking
transformation physics.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.947 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
other subject.

00:23:07.947 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I'd be curious about

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.980 align:middle line:84%
is in those portal
states, or while you're

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:90%
in the portal itself--

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:84%
which is, there's
no time apparently--

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.130 align:middle line:90%
that that's negated.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would be something
to study and figure out.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.505 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So, Randy, what
but the surrounding space,

00:23:23.505 --> 00:23:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and the vehicle itself,
and your passengers,

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:90%
and the gas in the car?

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, explain
that whole concept

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:90%
when you go through this.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.735 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: So apparently,
it's how much you encompass.

00:23:34.735 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one
of the things I

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.277 align:middle line:84%
say is you're supposed to
have about a 9 foot energy

00:23:38.277 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:90%
field as a minimum.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
But apparently,
somewhere just outside

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:84%
of the car, and let's see,
maybe a foot, all the space

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:84%
that you're occupying
energetically

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:90%
is what ends up at the new--

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:84%
it goes from where you
are to where you are.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:84%
It goes from here
to here, if that

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:05.220 align:middle line:84%
makes sense, the whole space
plus maybe a little bit.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And none of the dirt went
with it or the roadway,

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:90%
but the vehicle itself.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And you think about when
you go walking or running,

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.950 align:middle line:84%
you're taking your vehicle,
you're taking all of it,

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.380 align:middle line:84%
but you're not taking the
road you're walking on

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.880 align:middle line:84%
or the bicycle, you
see what I mean?

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Randy, there have
been documented cases out there

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:84%
on video and through
witnessing this, many people,

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:84%
of people showing up
and leaving one area,

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:84%
maybe showing up 34 miles away
or maybe even 2000 miles away.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Is this a similar--

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Yes.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I think it happens more than
people maybe are aware of.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it's probably
certainly rare.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.200 align:middle line:84%
But again, you can
go find information

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.180 align:middle line:90%
once you start looking at it.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not time travel.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It's translating from
here to there without time

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle line:84%
or without space, or certainly
less space is the way I use it.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
something that you

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.800 align:middle line:84%
can look at everything from
Stonehenge to wherever and go,

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.830 align:middle line:84%
well, if there was a purpose
in doing this, what was it?

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And if a portal
was something that

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:84%
was what they were
trying to achieve,

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:84%
then they were trying to achieve
it was stone age materials.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And now we go to
modern day science,

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and there's no reason to
think that they haven't tried

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.537 align:middle line:90%
to produce the same effects.

00:25:25.537 --> 00:25:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware of the
government or corporations

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.680 align:middle line:84%
making, or replicating,
or reverse-engineering

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:90%
natural portals?

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: No, I mean,
the whole phenomena

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:84%
of "Stargate," that movie
is kind of based on that.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Only, you know, the
one we walked through,

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing there.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.350 align:middle line:90%
There's no physicality to it.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that would
be one of the things we'd

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:84%
say is that, if I'm here
and go from here to here,

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:84%
there's no physicality
between the two.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And in our minds in humanity,
we go from point to point,

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.230 align:middle line:84%
we go from, remember
some progression.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
there's no progression.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, how does your
clothing that you're wearing,

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and maybe your watch and wallet,
how does that travel with you?

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
consciously intending

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to be somewhere, but the
material aspects of you the

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.780 align:middle line:84%
stuff that you have
around you are also--

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:90%
are they part of that intention?

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: You have an
information field.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Everybody does.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things is,
that information field

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.070 align:middle line:90%
contains a lot of data.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.310 align:middle line:84%
If you think about memory,
you think about this, that,

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:84%
and the other, it contains
all your connections

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.390 align:middle line:84%
to everybody you've ever
known, your entire lineage,

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.850 align:middle line:84%
everybody who's ever
been part of your DNA.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean this goes on forever.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So the information
density of a human

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.090 align:middle line:84%
is phenomenal, much greater than
almost anything else out there.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
think about, I am

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:09.450 align:middle line:84%
going to go from
here to here, what

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:90%
all are you taking with you?

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, we would go, well, how
much space does that encompass?

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And so from that standpoint
alone, we could say, well,

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:84%
some people may be taking
nine foot bubble with them

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.850 align:middle line:84%
each time they take a
step down the street,

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:84%
each time they ride a bicycle,
or a 10 foot or a 3 foot.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.890 align:middle line:84%
It's all different for
everybody, subjective.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And could
be more specific,

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.920 align:middle line:84%
such as, if I see just
you and through my brain,

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and interpreting the energy
of just you and just me.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:90%
And you have these clothes on.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:90%
I have these clothes on.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.310 align:middle line:90%
And we're in a vehicle.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always
have to be a large--

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
want people thinking

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:90%
it's this perfect sphere.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.495 align:middle line:84%
And everything in the
sphere goes because it's

00:27:57.495 --> 00:28:00.060 align:middle line:90%
what I can interpret as energy.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Right.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, the problem with
this, and the problem why

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:84%
it's probably never
been discussed in public

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.020 align:middle line:90%
is there's aspects.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably one of
the qualities of doing this

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:18.090 align:middle line:84%
that there's something about the
quality of the translation that

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:90%
includes your car.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the doctor--
physicist friend of mine,

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:90%
he had a big problem on that.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't have to
follow laws of thermodynamics

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.610 align:middle line:90%
if I'm not in this universe.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And so now, here we
go again, is there

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.640 align:middle line:84%
some sort of other way
of looking at this?

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And really, that is
all that's required.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.610 align:middle line:84%
People say, what's
the technique?

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just another way of looking
at how time and space work

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.680 align:middle line:84%
or how you move
from here to there.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And I learned part of this
early on in martial arts

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.180 align:middle line:90%
after I got to a certain point.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is that you
can manipulate, right?

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And throughout our history,
all the spiritual techniques,

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:01.230 align:middle line:84%
all the spiritual
centers, all the artifacts

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:02.310 align:middle line:90%
we see all them were--

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:05.690 align:middle line:84%
everybody in the world is
practicing some form of this,

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:06.600 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:84%
We look at technology and, you
know, Machu Picchu, and look

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
at technology in
Egypt and Mesoamerica

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and go, somebody
was moving around.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they go, well, there
wouldn't any reed boats.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe they
weren't using boats.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, everybody goes, oh,
no, no, you can't do that.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And any time they say you can't
do that, they should maybe

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.025 align:middle line:90%
come to our laboratory.

00:29:28.025 --> 00:29:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, they should.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.370 align:middle line:90%


00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a thought
process, an added thought

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:84%
process, that I had put in
place so I could go there.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's like folders, you
know, and I'm talking up

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness part.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Right.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And when I have
that thought process

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and lead it into consciousness,
I open that pathway,

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.990 align:middle line:90%
like you said.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: Right.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.568 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And I could see
all the different things now

00:29:53.568 --> 00:29:55.980 align:middle line:90%
I can do through that pathway.

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY: Yes, because
there's a lot more to this.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, conservation of energy,
the amount of gas we use.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:08.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's just something-- what
I do is, if I decide to do it,

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.690 align:middle line:84%
like I say, I'm running late
or want to get somewhere,

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:12.740 align:middle line:90%
I just like--

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.370 align:middle line:90%
it's like flipping a switch.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Or I access that folder.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's not necessarily
an immediate effect.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just that somewhere
between here and Dallas--

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.333 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It changes.

00:30:26.333 --> 00:30:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: --I've lost 100 miles.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, lost it, didn't go
there, didn't something.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well, excellent, Randy.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.388 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
coming on the show today.

00:30:36.388 --> 00:30:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY: You're welcome, Emery.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.970 align:middle line:90%
This was great fun.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.810 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
