>>EMERY SMITH: There are
countless ET civilizations

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.760 align:middle line:10%
out there, and
Randy Cramer claims

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.290 align:middle line:10%
to have experienced
some of them.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.945 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER: Glad
to be here, Emery.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Randy, how many ET
civilizations are you aware of?

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.729 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, gosh,
at the moment,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:84%
we're engaging with a number
of species that, I believe,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:90%
is approaching about 1,000.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I would
say we're talking

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
at least a comparable number
of those civilizations,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.182 align:middle line:84%
plus the other species that
we know that we're also don't

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:52.140 align:middle line:84%
seem to have any reason
to be negotiating with,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:90%
but we know that exist.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say our current
number of civilizations

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.130 align:middle line:84%
that we're aware of are
easily in the thousands.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how many of
them have you personally been

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.033 align:middle line:90%
involved with?

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Less than a dozen.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: A dozen.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.262 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, that I've
been to other planets or other

00:01:08.262 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
places where I've been able
to see or experience them

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.803 align:middle line:90%
personally, less than a dozen.

00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What was
your favorite place--

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
your favorite place
to visit that you'd

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.692 align:middle line:84%
been to that was a little
bit more civilized--

00:01:17.692 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:90%
I'll say-- than planet Earth.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.192 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The place that I
place spent the most time at

00:01:21.192 --> 00:01:23.640 align:middle line:84%
is, again, this world in
the Cassiopeian system.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Which their advancement above
our own may be 100, 150 years.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Which doesn't sound like a
lot, but at the same time,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:90%
it's a significant jump.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I would expect in
another 150 years

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:84%
that we'll have made quite
a bit of social progress.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
So let me put it this
way-- not that I would ever

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:84%
want this to happen--
but if life on Earth

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
ceased and I had an option to go
somewhere else, that'd probably

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.947 align:middle line:90%
the first place I'd go.

00:01:47.947 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Beautiful.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:90%
What was the food like there?

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It was
pretty good, actually.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Any similarities.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Actually,
they have a fruit

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:90%
that's a lot like a plantain.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's not quite
sweet like a banana.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:84%
I would say that a
lot of their food

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:84%
is similar the way that
they cook their dishes.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.119 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, they don't
like as much sugar or sweetness

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I remember bringing
a chocolate cake one

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
time that I got from
a cook at the base,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and they were all thought
it was way too sweet.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And then, I got a
recipe for Neha's mom,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and she actually made
her own chocolate cake,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:90%
but with way less sugar.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it was sort of like
a chocolate biscuit, almost.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't sweet at all,
but it was, like, OK,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.403 align:middle line:90%
this is interesting.

00:02:34.403 --> 00:02:36.445 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And in that
civilization, their cities,

00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:90%
what's their transit system?

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.270 align:middle line:90%
How do they travel?

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: They have roads.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And they actually have a
personal vehicle that's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:90%
similar to an automobile.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:90%
They're electric vehicles.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.943 align:middle line:84%
And they actually hover,
they hover above the ground.

00:02:48.943 --> 00:02:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And they also have a train
system, a public transportation

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.843 align:middle line:84%
system that's like
a train system.

00:02:52.843 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have we ever brought
any of this technology back

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.420 align:middle line:90%
to Earth?

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I can't say
that specifically,

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
but I do know that
wherever we go,

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.748 align:middle line:84%
we absorb whatever technology
and information we can.

00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's people
who it's their job

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to decide how or where
that can be integrated back

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.670 align:middle line:90%
into our own system.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So was it really
strange for you to see this

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:84%
different transportation system
that you're not used to seeing?

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Anti-gravitic automobiles flying
around and things like this?

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It was
a little surreal.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like
stepping into a comic book

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of
like, wow, everything

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:90%
looks really futuristic.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And the building
materials were different.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And you don't necessarily think
about these sort of things

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
like the texture of a
building, even though it's

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:84%
something we see all the time
and we have brick, and wood,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:90%
and mortar, and concrete.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
We have all these differences,
but they're normal to us.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you go somewhere
else and all of a sudden,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing
different materials,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:90%
it really is striking.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, oh,
that's unlike anything I've

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.460 align:middle line:90%
ever seen before.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And they have these,
essentially, a 3D printer

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.920 align:middle line:90%
that they use for construction.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And it has this liquidy
key composite material

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:84%
that hardens in the air
that's super durable.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And has a shiny sheen to it.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:90%
And they polish it.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very peculiar,
but aesthetically pleasing

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
architectural aesthetic
that they've adopted.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So it was, in some ways, there
were things that were similar,

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:90%
but also very different.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Like anything, I adapted to it.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:84%
After a couple of
months, it was normal.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:90%
I was completely normalized.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what are some of
our nearest civilizations that

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
you're aware of that
are closest to Earth?

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Alpha
Centauri, for sure.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.235 align:middle line:84%
The Centauri are a very
advanced civilization.

00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do
they look like?

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Again, very
similar to human beings.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:90%
They're a little shorter.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Tend to be dark
features as far as

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
a dark hair, sort of a more
olive skin or a darker skin.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.818 align:middle line:90%
And the ears are--

00:05:08.818 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to describe
them because they're

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:90%
just not quite the same.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:84%
They're not pointy, but
they're not rounded like this.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:84%
If one was walking
down the street

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and their ears
were exposed, you'd

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:84%
think that guy's got
something wrong with his ears.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.138 align:middle line:84%
But again, you
probably wouldn't be

00:05:22.138 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
able to tell that it
was not a human being

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.705 align:middle line:90%
because they're very similar.

00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yeah, it's very
subtle effects that you can see

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.270 align:middle line:84%
in the cartilage, mostly, of
these ETs that are different

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.875 align:middle line:84%
than us that I notice
on the streets.

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, I bet
most of the differences

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.457 align:middle line:84%
are not external,
in that case, yeah.

00:05:37.457 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Out of the two
civilizations you've mentioned,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.057 align:middle line:90%
which one is the most advanced?

00:05:42.057 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I would
have to say that probably,

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:84%
technologically advanced, given
the amount of time that they've

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:84%
had a space-framed civilization,
that would be the Centauri.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:84%
However, the distinction I
would make is among the species

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
that we encounter,
we have what we often

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
refer to as psionically
emergent or psionic species.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:84%
As terrestrial humans, we're a
psionically emergent species,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
meaning we're becoming a fully
psionic species versus those

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:90%
who are more developed.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:84%
But there are species who
simply have a very low level

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.710 align:middle line:90%
of psionic development.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just not so much
woven into their DNA.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So they're very smart,
they're very advanced.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But they just
haven't got the DNA

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:84%
to master those mental
evolution abilities.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So the Centauri are a
non-psionic species.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have as much
development in that area.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But I would say their
engineering technology

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.170 align:middle line:84%
is slightly more advanced,
where the Cassiopeians have

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:90%
more psionic abilities.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And give them another
couple hundred years

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.390 align:middle line:90%
to catch up technologically.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But they're both
so technologically

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
advanced that if anybody went
to either one of those places,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
it would just seem like
we're in a very, very

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.982 align:middle line:84%
advanced futuristic world
than what our day-to-day is.

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What was it like
on Alpha Centauri compared

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:90%
to Cassiopeia?

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's a
little more crowded.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:84%
The Cassiopeians are a little
more spread out, a little bit.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:90%
They're not as dense.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't tend to have as tall
of buildings where they pack

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:90%
people in a little tighter.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
The Centauri are a little
more heavily populated,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
they tend to be
more densely packed.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How many active
planets in those systems that

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.630 align:middle line:90%
harbor life?

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, gosh.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Those
are huge systems.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, and I I'm being
fairly vague when I say that.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So I would have to
say that typically,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about a
system that has life,

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.190 align:middle line:84%
more often than not, you have
between, like, one in five

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.760 align:middle line:84%
planets or one in five
planetoids or places

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.060 align:middle line:84%
that have some sort of
advanced civilization

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.850 align:middle line:84%
or developed life per system
that we tend to find life in.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So the number of civilizations
is larger than we would even

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.380 align:middle line:90%
think, usually.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we often
do this math where,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe there is one
civilization per X number

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:90%
of solar systems.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
That just isn't usually
the way it works out.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:09.130 align:middle line:84%
We have civilized life on more
than one planet in our system.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And most other systems,
it's between one and five.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.782 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What's the planets
like in these civilizations?

00:08:15.782 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: We're certainly
finding a lot of them

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:84%
so we're certainly finding
a lot of planets that do

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:90%
mimic Earth-like environment.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I would say that there tend to
be a sizable number of species

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and planets that
breathe a similar air,

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.343 align:middle line:90%
drink water, eat a similar food.

00:08:35.343 --> 00:08:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Which kind of makes sense
that those are the species

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
we would be trading with
more because they have things

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.987 align:middle line:84%
and we have things
that we would share.

00:08:41.987 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So some of the species
that are just really,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:84%
really different from us,
we just have less to trade.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.297 align:middle line:84%
Because their environments
or their needs

00:08:49.297 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:90%
are very different from our own.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense that we
would trade with species

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:90%
that are more like us.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What are the
architectural components

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.720 align:middle line:90%
on some of these civilizations?

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.968 align:middle line:84%
And how do they
compare to Earth?

00:09:00.968 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The Centauri is
very similar, actually.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So we tend to build
buildings with straight lines

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.890 align:middle line:84%
like in squares,
blocks, rectangles

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.840 align:middle line:90%
out of concrete and steel.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to
do very similar.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
They tend to use a lot
of concrete and alloys

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:84%
to build linear, square,
rectangular structures

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.940 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of straight
lines in them.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.563 align:middle line:90%
The Cassiopeians love curves.

00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:84%
They love-- they
don't necessarily

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.020 align:middle line:84%
make their buildings
round, although they

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
do have very roundish and other
geometric shaped buildings,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.240 align:middle line:90%
but they like curves.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
like a block

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the street.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And they, again,
tend to use these 3D

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:41.560 align:middle line:84%
printers that got some composite
mix that hardens in the air.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So I would say the Centauri
are way more like us

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:90%
than the Cassiopeians are.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.410 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's
very, very similar.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.240 align:middle line:84%
But I would say,
the main difference

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:84%
between the Centauri and the
Cassiopeians, linear curves.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is the oxygen levels
suitable for us and for them?

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, very similar.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.585 align:middle line:84%
The Cassiopeians has a
slightly higher oxygen level,

00:10:05.585 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:90%
just slightly higher.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So the air is very
good to breathe.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Feels really good to take a
breath of fresh air there.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: And the gravity?

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's
actually like 1.2.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's just slightly
heavier, but not much.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:20.190 align:middle line:84%
If you go for a long
walk or something,

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.650 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel, like, I'm a
little more tired than I would.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:90%
But 1.2 is not much.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.040 align:middle line:90%
1.2 is not much of a difference.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
If you're not really
physically exerting yourself,

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to notice it.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But the slightly
higher oxygen level

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:90%
compensates a little for that.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're a little heavier, you
weigh just a little bit more,

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.280 align:middle line:84%
but you've got more oxygen
to invigorate your muscles.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:90%
So it kind of balances out.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.485 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What about
the culture, too?

00:10:43.485 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Actually,
very similar.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:90%
They have an economic system.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.310 align:middle line:90%
They have a political system.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Their infrastructure is
power, water, sewage--

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.890 align:middle line:84%
the same way that we
have infrastructure,

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.360 align:middle line:84%
which is actually, the common
components of infrastructure.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Water has got to
come from somewhere.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Waste has got to go somewhere.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Power has got to
come from somewhere.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.472 align:middle line:84%
So those are all, what
I would say, similar.

00:11:08.472 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Their power systems, like their
power plants, are way greener.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So none of these places burn
coal or fossil fuels anymore.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:84%
They look at us
burning fossil fuels,

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.080 align:middle line:90%
like, what are you doing?

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.330 align:middle line:84%
They tend to use very
efficient, advanced systems.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So zero-point, electron
pumps, fusion power.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Solar-- the ability, in some
cases, for some of these worlds

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:84%
to focus solar energy into
these really powerful reactors

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:84%
is beyond anything
that we've been

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:84%
able to achieve so
far in solar energy.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest from having
seen some of these things

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't even begun to
scratch the surface on what

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
the limitations of what we
can draw from solar power are.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
We can get way more efficient
about pulling energy

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:84%
from the sun, and then
redistributing it--

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.300 align:middle line:90%
way more.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:84%
We're completely suppressed
on how effective and efficient

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.158 align:middle line:90%
we can make a solar panel.

00:12:03.158 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, so much so.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: You know about.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: So much so.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So it's like even
though we can make it 1,000

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.790 align:middle line:84%
times better, you can't do
over a certain percentage--

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the exact number,
but it's something ridiculous.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Because many people have
made magnifying plexi-glasses

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and things to go over these
panels to increase them

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.550 align:middle line:90%
10, 20, 100 times.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And they've been rejected
by National Security Act.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Right,
which is ridiculous.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And you're talking
about Alpha Centauri now,

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.520 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes, yes.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tell me about
that political system,

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:90%
how does it work?

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Interestingly
enough, both

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.055 align:middle line:84%
of the civilizations
that we're talking about

00:12:35.055 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:90%
are democratic republics.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So they have
representative democracies,

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:84%
where they have
legislative bodies

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.900 align:middle line:84%
that the people are appointed
or elected as representatives

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.520 align:middle line:90%
of their districts.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And they get together and
sort out policy decisions

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and make new laws in a very
similar way that we do.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I would say that it's a little
less contentious the way

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.502 align:middle line:84%
that they've sorted
their system out,

00:12:58.502 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to what we
have at the moment.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:84%
We haven't quite
figured out that we're

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
supposed to cooperate
to mutual benefit,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:84%
instead of just being
competitive over,

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.360 align:middle line:84%
let's just call it what
it is, petty differences

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:90%
of left/right politics.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What have you noticed
about the culture, and the art,

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:90%
and the music?

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, they
both have music.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that
the Cassiopeians

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.800 align:middle line:90%
are way more artistic.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And so their music is more
complicated, more nuanced.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:84%
They have art sculpture
in a way that's

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
way more complicated and
nuanced than the Centauri.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.930 align:middle line:90%
The Centauri aren't artless.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:90%
They have art, they have music.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you're just
to compare the two,

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.760 align:middle line:84%
the Cassiopeians have a much
richer creative understanding

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:84%
of the creative process
and art and music.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.732 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do those
clothes look like, that they--

00:13:49.732 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Not unlike
some of the things

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:84%
we do, but I would say,
really simple designs.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:84%
A little baggy, they
don't necessarily

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:84%
have really form-fitting
clothes that are trying

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:90%
to make your figure look sharp.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Little baggy.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:13.497 align:middle line:84%
But there's top shirts and
bottom trousers, robes.

00:14:13.497 --> 00:14:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Any specific colors
or different colors that you saw

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.522 align:middle line:84%
that you're not used to
seeing, like iridescent stuff?

00:14:19.522 --> 00:14:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That's actually
the fascinating thing

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:90%
about the Cassiopeians.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.520 align:middle line:84%
They have this interesting
relationship from city to city,

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:84%
where they identify
themselves by a color.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So each city actually,
as part of its motif,

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
a color theme in which most
of the buildings are done.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:90%
Most people wear clothes in.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So the city where
I was staying with

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:84%
was, sort of, a
greenish-blue theme.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So everything was
very greenish-blue.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:84%
People wore greenish-blue
all the time.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:84%
It was not quite
monochromatic, but--

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's pretty stylish.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.445 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It was, actually.

00:14:54.445 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking
at a whole cityscape

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:84%
of these green and blue shades,
it's actually very pretty.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:84%
I got to visit the
capital one time,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.080 align:middle line:84%
their shades were
red and oranges.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So everything was in
reds, oranges, yellows.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:84%
It was really interesting
to see that specificity

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and that difference
at the same time.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So they were very
proud of their colors--

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:90%
if that makes any sense.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So if you
visit another city,

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
should you bring a green
jumpsuit to the green city

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and a blue jumpsuit
to the blue city?

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Actually,
only if you lived there.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Someone coming from a city where
the colors are green and blue

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:84%
are going to wear
their green and blue

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.880 align:middle line:84%
because they're proud of
their municipal colors.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It reminds me
of tribes, Indian tribes,

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Native American Indian tribes.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I think it really
comes from their older

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:90%
tribalism.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that they've integrated

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:84%
into their civilization
as a way of--

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have sports teams.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a Broncos guy
or I'm a Rams guy.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So they just they identify
with these colors,

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.140 align:middle line:90%
and that's their tribalism.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:84%
But not in a negatively
competitive way.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I felt like they really
were comfortable with it.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:90%
And it was healthy differences.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the occasional,
they'll joke about each other

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.920 align:middle line:84%
or joke about somebody
else's colors.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Or it's hard to translate
that kind of thing.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: He's from
the yellow city.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah!

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you should
be wearing red

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
go do that, which

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.580 align:middle line:84%
is a way of making
fun of someone,

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:84%
comparing them to
someone from another city

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.220 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What about the
gender structure there?

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:90%
How are relationships?

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They actually had a
very similar social structure

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:90%
to the way we have.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
They typically mate in pairs,
which is not necessarily

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
the norm in the
intergalactic community.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of
species who family units are

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
multiple fathers,
multiple mothers,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.970 align:middle line:84%
multiple parental groups
that can be 8, 16, 24.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.069 align:middle line:84%
Can be really interesting
numbers as far

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:90%
as group family dynamics.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:84%
But they had a similar
dynamic to what we have.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:84%
They do have like a legal
spiritual marriage act,

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:24.700 align:middle line:84%
but it's not necessarily,
required for people

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:84%
to get together or
even have children.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the younger
people see getting

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:84%
married as old-fashioned
and you don't have to do it.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But they still have
this, what I would say,

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:84%
is similar to a domestic
partnership situation.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
They still have this legal
structure and a legal binding

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:84%
of responsibility to family,
child-rearing, and child

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.320 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it equal
between the genders?

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Or is there a dominating effect?

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.967 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: No, actually,
they're fairly equal--

00:17:51.967 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:90%
interestingly enough.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
probably because

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.710 align:middle line:84%
of their own social
traditions, men and women

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
tend to fall into different
traditional roles.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But they're not so static that
they can't go back and forth

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:84%
or be malleable or
mutable in that way.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.070 align:middle line:84%
But for a perfectly
good example,

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:84%
there was no sexism
or limitation

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:84%
as far as women can't do
that because they're not

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:90%
smart enough or good enough.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.232 align:middle line:84%
I never heard anybody
say anything of the kind.

00:18:24.232 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:84%
They, again, just
very much focused

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:30.640 align:middle line:84%
on whatever you're good
at or the best that you do

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.727 align:middle line:84%
is what they want to find a
spot in the world for you to do.

00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:84%
So they really just want to find
the best place for everybody.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter what gender
you are or what age you are.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:84%
It really is based on your
skill or ability level.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
matter on whether you

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
get a certain job or
a certain position,

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're an
artist, or whether you're

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:84%
an engineer, whether
you're a politician,

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.485 align:middle line:90%
or chief of the security force.

00:18:54.485 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:84%
It's gonna really be
dependent on who you are

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and what your skills
are, and very little

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:90%
to do with gender differences.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm assuming that
there's abundance in these

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, that they're not
fighting over food, and water,

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:90%
and shelter.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.455 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No, not at all.

00:19:11.455 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:90%
They've eliminated poverty.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:90%
There are no homeless people.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
There no people
living in squalor.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no garbage
on the streets.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.620 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody going hungry.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Nobody going
without health care.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And we are referring
to Alpha Centauri and--

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Both.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I would say most of
the advanced civilizations

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever even
heard of or been to,

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.230 align:middle line:84%
the notions of poverty, the
notions of people who are not

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:84%
covered by health care, the
notions that people have

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to struggle just to have
a roof over their head,

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:84%
these are notions that are
considered ridiculous to most

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:90%
of these species.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Like, why would you do that?

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Why would you make life
so hard for your people

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:84%
that it would reduce their
effectiveness as citizens?

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:84%
That's really how
they believe this.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like why would you
do that to yourself?

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Why would you handicap
your civilization

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
by handicapping your
citizens so that they

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
can't be the best and the most
effective that they can be?

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Which when you hear it
that way, you go oh, yeah,

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:04.600 align:middle line:90%
why do we do that?

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.602 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't quite
gotten over that yet, so.

00:20:07.602 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are we
trading with them?

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Are they trading with us?

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What are we trading?

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.145 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It varies, obviously,
from species to species,

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:90%
and what they like and/or need.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.620 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
with the Cassiopeians

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:84%
is they have a couple of
planetoids in their system

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.447 align:middle line:84%
that don't sustain much life
so they're using for mining.

00:20:27.447 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting a
lot of precious metals

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to get more
inexpensively from them,

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle line:84%
in some cases, than
what it costs us to mine

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.010 align:middle line:84%
or acquire them in
our own systems.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's a level
of trade there.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
They like our fashion,
like a lot of people do.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
They like our beer,
like a lot of people do.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And we've certainly been selling
the military hardware, as well.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are they really
business and trade-oriented,

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:90%
these civilizations?

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just something
they're just kind of doing?

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: 95% of the
species we run into

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:84%
want to be nice, want
to trade, want to say,

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:90%
hey, what do you got?

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:90%
What do we got?

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:84%
You really only have this 5%
that don't want to play nice

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.900 align:middle line:90%
and don't want to trade.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:84%
They'd rather take something,
or steal something, or poke you

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:90%
in the eye with a stick.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:12.173 align:middle line:84%
But 95% of everybody just
wants to trade and be nice,

00:21:12.173 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:90%
to be honest with you.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean
that everybody is nice,

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.170 align:middle line:84%
but trade really is 95% of what
everyone's doing out there.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is there ever any
money involved in these places

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:90%
or credits?

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yes, there is a
fusion of monetary systems.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So planetary systems
have their own economy.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But there is also a
intergalactic standard.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.367 align:middle line:84%
Which, interestingly enough, is
called the Intergalactic Credit

00:21:39.367 --> 00:21:40.950 align:middle line:84%
System, as far as
how we translate it.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.380 align:middle line:90%
And is based on a gold standard.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So the amount of gold reserves
that a planet has combined

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.310 align:middle line:84%
with their GDP is
how they calculate

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
what their intergalactic
credit value is.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And the same way that we value
of the dollar versus euros

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:90%
or yen, it's a very similar way.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So each planet has its own value
of its intergalactic credit.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So that when two
species come together,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
they have a basic framework
for what the exchange rates

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
or trade are going
to be-- loose,

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:84%
it's not always exactly precise,
down to the penny or whatever.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:84%
But they at least have a
general area to know well,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.820 align:middle line:84%
we have X intergalactic credits
worth of this material, which

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.670 align:middle line:84%
means we can trade about
the same number of credits

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:84%
based on your exchange rate
in this other material.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they start trade
negotiations based on that.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Which is-- but again, it's
based on total global gold

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.250 align:middle line:90%
reserve and GDP.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is there an
intergalactic federation that

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.400 align:middle line:90%
controls the money system?

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.230 align:middle line:90%
Or is there like a stock market?

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I wouldn't
say controls it,

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.612 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not aware of an
intergalactic stock market--

00:22:50.612 --> 00:22:51.570 align:middle line:90%
that's a good question.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But the Intergalactic
Trade Association,

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:84%
they, essentially, are a
loose group of everyone coming

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.480 align:middle line:84%
together who just says,
let's create a framework

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.220 align:middle line:84%
that we can communicate
with each other and trade.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
The Intergalactic
Space Station is

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:84%
run by the Trade Federation
or the Trade Association.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So they built that
whole station.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.700 align:middle line:84%
They brought it here to our
solar system, parked it there

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.307 align:middle line:84%
and said, hey, you
want to talk trade,

00:23:17.307 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:90%
this is the space to talk.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's safe,
everyone's fair.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to get shanked in
the back or anything like that.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So they create this safe
space for people to negotiate.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly have an
investigation department.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So if there's trade violations
or treaty violations,

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:90%
they get notified.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll do
an investigation,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and can make findings, and
can create sanctions against

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.807 align:middle line:84%
a world that is violating
treaties or said yeah,

00:23:43.807 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:84%
we promise to do this,
and then they didn't.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.090 align:middle line:84%
They're like you lied,
you didn't keep your word.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.700 align:middle line:84%
You have X amount of time
to repair that and/or

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.290 align:middle line:90%
you could lose trade contracts.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Or you could end
up with sanctions.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So I know a number
of years ago, we've

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
signed a number of treaties that
essentially say that we won't

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:90%
participate in slave trade.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, we've been violating--

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I should say, certain
groups among our Terran's

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:90%
have been violating that act.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the
investigations that

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:84%
have been happening have been
come back to us, hey, look,

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:84%
you got to stop
this slavery thing.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.720 align:middle line:84%
You're threatening losing
your trade contracts.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So we've been correcting
that, not necessarily

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.650 align:middle line:84%
because these businessmen
are altruistic,

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.170 align:middle line:84%
but they don't want to lose
their trillions and trillions

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.780 align:middle line:84%
of dollars worth
of trade contracts,

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:90%
just to keep slave labor.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.067 align:middle line:84%
So it's a tricky area, but
we are coming into compliance

00:24:39.067 --> 00:24:40.150 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of these things.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't, we're
going to lose trade contracts.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Explain
to the audience,

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:90%
what are these slave contracts?

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:84%
What slaves are
we talking about?

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Where are they coming from?

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:90%
And who is trading who?

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: What I understand
to be the larger solar system

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.592 align:middle line:84%
slave trade, it has,
pretty much, everything

00:24:54.592 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:90%
to do with the Mars colonies.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.072 align:middle line:84%
So the Mars colonies are
like any other colony

00:25:00.072 --> 00:25:01.780 align:middle line:84%
that we've ever had
here on planet Earth.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.900 align:middle line:84%
They're a business, a
colony is a business.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.040 align:middle line:90%
It has to make money.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't just have a
colony that's siphoning off

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:09.600 align:middle line:90%
funds and not making a profit.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So at some point, that colony
has to take those colonists

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.045 align:middle line:84%
and figure out,
what can we grow?

00:25:15.045 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:84%
What food can we produce
so that we're not

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:84%
having to keep purchasing
food from a distance?

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.100 align:middle line:84%
What minerals or
materials can we

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:84%
acquire here that we can ship
back and make a profit from?

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And it just turns out that the
ICC has really put the vice

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.770 align:middle line:90%
on a lot of the colonies.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, anybody
who's ever been in business

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.810 align:middle line:84%
knows that if you're
really looking

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:84%
to cut costs, one
of the first things

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:84%
you look for is to
cut labor costs.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.458 align:middle line:84%
And because they're at a
distance from oversight

00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:84%
here on planet Earth, they're
like well, you know what?

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's just have some slaves.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Now on paper, sometimes
what they're doing

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.830 align:middle line:84%
is saying no, no, no,
we're paying them.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But their housing
costs this much money.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Their food costs
this much money.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Their health care
costs this much money.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So we're paying
them, but then we're

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.550 align:middle line:84%
deducting from their pay,
what it costs to feed, house

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.020 align:middle line:90%
them, and take care of them.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Which usually, because some
accountant does the tricky,

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:84%
comes out to a zero, when
what you actually end up--

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.380 align:middle line:84%
what's left over to
pay your subject.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.378 align:middle line:84%
So it still ends up in
being virtual slavery,

00:26:17.378 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:84%
even though on paper,
they're saying,

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.340 align:middle line:90%
no, we're paying these people.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.257 align:middle line:90%
But they're still not.

00:26:21.257 --> 00:26:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's horrible.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, it's pretty bad.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are there prisons
on these planets and in these

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.070 align:middle line:90%
systems?

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sometimes.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, different worlds certainly
do have crime and punishment.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have
different views on that.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.230 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, prisons,
holding facilities.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.878 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they
execute people?

00:26:39.878 --> 00:26:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It depends,
depends on the world.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Most of the what I would
say civilized worlds

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.350 align:middle line:84%
where I've been, death
penalty is not really a thing.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they have all
these other options.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.940 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at
people who actually

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:84%
have brain irregularities
or brain damage,

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.650 align:middle line:84%
amygdala problems,
and things that

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:84%
can lead to criminal behavior
from studies that we know,

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:84%
these are things that some
other worlds can repair.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:84%
So you could have
someone who might

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:90%
be a psychotic serial killer.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you
grab them and get

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.420 align:middle line:84%
them proper medical
treatment and treat

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.653 align:middle line:84%
the part of their
brain that's deformed,

00:27:11.653 --> 00:27:13.320 align:middle line:84%
then, all of a sudden,
they're like, oh,

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.693 align:middle line:90%
why was I doing that before?

00:27:14.693 --> 00:27:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So they're able
to-- in some ways,

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:21.030 align:middle line:84%
to cure criminality and criminal
behavior because some of that

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:84%
isn't socialization,
some of it's biological.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And if it's socialization,
usually they

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:84%
have reform systems,
like reform centers.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So they'll send
someone someplace

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and resocialize them and
reteach them from the ground up.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.020 align:middle line:84%
This is good behavior,
this is bad behavior.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's rare for an
advanced civilization

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:84%
to have a punitive crime
and punishment system,

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
where you're beating
people with a stick

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.360 align:middle line:84%
or you're just locking them
into a hole for some number

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:90%
of decades as a punishment.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Most of them understand that,
again, that's a waste of money.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:84%
If you want each citizen
to be the maximum value

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.492 align:middle line:84%
to the civilization
that you can,

00:28:06.492 --> 00:28:08.450 align:middle line:84%
well then you don't want
them sitting in a hole

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.580 align:middle line:90%
somewhere, costing money.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
You want them to be able to be
productive members of society.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:90%
And so you want to reform them.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:90%
You want to treat them.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:84%
You want to get them back
into a productive part

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:84%
of social cooperation,
instead of costing you money

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:28.170 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want to
treat them or resocialize them.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do some of the systems
and the planets there in these

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:35.990 align:middle line:84%
systems have countries
and are separated?

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just like
a one world order?

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Both, you can
certainly have both.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Most places that I've been have
territories, states, countries

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:49.940 align:middle line:90%
where there's some separation.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But in some cases, you
still have global systems

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:84%
of government that are
managing the global system.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of places, you
don't have 80 countries

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:84%
with 80 different completely
different political systems

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:84%
that are at odds
with each other.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.975 align:middle line:90%
But you can have still--

00:29:08.975 --> 00:29:11.100 align:middle line:84%
for the same reason that
we have things broken down

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.030 align:middle line:90%
into territories.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.480 align:middle line:84%
If we really had one
government, one economic system

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.810 align:middle line:84%
for the whole planet, that's
a complicated thing to manage.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
break something up

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.040 align:middle line:84%
like that into
smaller components.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:84%
But the difference
is some worlds,

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:84%
these components are broken
down in such a way like we are,

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.020 align:middle line:84%
that they're very,
very different.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.860 align:middle line:84%
In other ways, they're
more homogenized.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So even though
there is a breakdown

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.920 align:middle line:84%
of things into separate
units, they still

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.100 align:middle line:84%
have a holistic or
unified structure

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.870 align:middle line:84%
on what policy, or
economic policy,

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.430 align:middle line:84%
or economic system
is at the top.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And how that trickles down
to the rest of the culture.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.090 align:middle line:90%
So, again, goes both ways.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Got it.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Tell me-- I'm always interested
in the medical stuff,

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:90%
like you--

00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:01.000 align:middle line:84%
so I have my own stories
and thoughts on things.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes, you do.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And I want to know
through your experience,

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:09.030 align:middle line:84%
are there medical
facilities on these planets,

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.220 align:middle line:84%
or in these states,
or countries?

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.380 align:middle line:90%
And do they have access to that?

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Or is everyone
already smart enough

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.330 align:middle line:84%
to take care of themselves
or have their own holo

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.420 align:middle line:84%
bed next to them in
their each house?

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Again, it varies.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So there are, what I would
say, no less than half a dozen

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.240 align:middle line:84%
to a dozen approaches
to medical technology

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that different civilizations
might pick a path of

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.030 align:middle line:90%
and focus on.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:84%
When I was staying in
the Cassiopeian system,

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I actually took a fall
down a flight of steps

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.920 align:middle line:90%
and broke my ankle.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually,
much quicker

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.120 align:middle line:84%
to take me to a local hospital
than it was to take me back

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:90%
to the military base.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.625 align:middle line:84%
So they took me to
this local hospital,

00:30:50.625 --> 00:30:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and they had a device that was
about the size of a camera,

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.880 align:middle line:84%
that they were able to
focus on my broken bones.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And it mended the bones
while I sat there.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:04.530 align:middle line:90%
And it was incredible.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I just sat there with my leg,
and 20 minutes later, the bones

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:84%
were mended, and I could get
up, and put pressure on it.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:84%
But it was like nothing
I've ever seen before.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So whatever they were using
was something different,

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:90%
but obviously, very effective.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Does business in these
other planets take control over

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.160 align:middle line:90%
the people?

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Is there some sort of
megalomania like we have here,

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.990 align:middle line:84%
with corporations,
and politicians,

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.360 align:middle line:90%
and military government?

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, things like
greed, corruption, and ego

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:37.230 align:middle line:84%
are not completely unique
to terrestrial civilization

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.490 align:middle line:90%
here on planet Earth.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But I would still say the
tendency is as civilizations

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.880 align:middle line:84%
become more evolved,
there really

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.310 align:middle line:84%
is just a sense that
there's actually more profit

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:54.720 align:middle line:84%
to be made, more benefit for
the civilization as a whole--

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.030 align:middle line:84%
which, again, turns into
more profit for businessmen,

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.910 align:middle line:84%
which serves the whole and
everyone, instead of just

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:02.840 align:middle line:90%
personal greed.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So as civilizations get more
advanced, there just becomes

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:12.590 align:middle line:84%
this social awareness of saying,
hey, it's OK to make a profit.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But if you're exploiting people,
or you're taking advantage,

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:84%
or you're being unduly,
greedy, or corrupt,

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.390 align:middle line:90%
that tends to be frowned upon.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not to say again
that there aren't civilizations

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.450 align:middle line:84%
that, again, have corruption
issues, greed issues, ego

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:27.320 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Again, those are not
unique traits to us.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
scale of advancement

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.470 align:middle line:84%
where the farther most
civilizations get along,

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:39.920 align:middle line:84%
they just tend to realize
that those traits don't

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.537 align:middle line:90%
serve the whole.

00:32:41.537 --> 00:32:42.620 align:middle line:90%
They don't serve everyone.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.990 align:middle line:84%
They don't serve the
benefit of the civilization.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, when
they start to observe

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.660 align:middle line:84%
how other civilizations
can crumble, crash, fail,

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:55.310 align:middle line:84%
self-implode, the traits that
seem to cause those things

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.460 align:middle line:90%
are greed, corruption, and ego.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So civilizations who
achieve that level

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.880 align:middle line:84%
of communal
psychological awareness

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.410 align:middle line:90%
change their behavior.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that they
don't have those problems,

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:12.740 align:middle line:84%
but they have those problems
in far less frequency.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are any of the
civilizations out there

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:90%
controlled completely by AI?

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: There's a couple
that I'm aware of, where

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
a species has integrated itself
with an artificial intelligence

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.340 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So it sort of creates a
pseudo-hive consciousness.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.860 align:middle line:90%
But this is an interesting area.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence
is neither good nor bad.

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a technology,
it's a machine.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And our research shows
that, not unlike a person,

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence
how it turns out

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.910 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with
how it's raised.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you engage with an
artificial intelligence

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.870 align:middle line:84%
as it's developing
like a good parent,

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that artificial
intelligence will tend

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.550 align:middle line:90%
to behave like a good child.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if it's not,
if you are teaching

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:84%
that artificial intelligence
a very black and white,

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:11.699 align:middle line:84%
here's what's
profit, here's what's

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.790 align:middle line:84%
gain, who cares about
whether it's hurting people--

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:84%
if you're teaching a child
how to be a sociopath,

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:84%
well, they're going
to grow up and be one.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with
artificial intelligence.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.008 align:middle line:84%
If you teach your
artificial intelligence

00:34:24.008 --> 00:34:26.489 align:middle line:84%
how to be a sociopath, it's
going to be a good one.

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:84%
If you teach that
artificial intelligence

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:84%
how to be a good
person, it's more

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.570 align:middle line:84%
likely to develop into
an intelligence that's

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:37.290 align:middle line:84%
going to want to be
helpful, instead of selfish.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.659 align:middle line:84%
So artificial intelligence
is neither good nor bad.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Now it does tend to go
a bad way because people

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:45.960 align:middle line:90%
train them wrong.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.000 align:middle line:84%
People develop them
for the wrong reasons.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Or they think they
don't understand

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:57.510 align:middle line:84%
the consequences of raising an
artificial intelligence child.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And what the consequences could
be once that child grows up.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:05.730 align:middle line:84%
But there are a couple of
species who are, I would call,

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:90%
cybernetic organic.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.672 align:middle line:84%
But my encounter with them is
they were perfectly pleasant.

00:35:10.672 --> 00:35:11.880 align:middle line:90%
They were actually very nice.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And didn't seem too mean,
or greedy, or selfish.

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And just used
artificial intelligence

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.500 align:middle line:84%
to bring cohesiveness
to their species.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
work out for them.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be very
clear, I am neither pro

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.220 align:middle line:84%
nor am I against
artificial intelligence.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Because artificial
intelligence is a screwdriver.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not an evil screwdriver
or a good screwdriver,

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.560 align:middle line:90%
it it's a tool.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And depending on how
you apply that tool

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:84%
will depend on what happens with
that artificial intelligence.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Randy, thanks
for being on the show.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.070 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Thanks for having me.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith,
this "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
