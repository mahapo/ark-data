[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:16.630 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.280 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So, we were talking
about this concept

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't that
surprised by the idea

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:84%
of very elaborate genetic
hybrids being made

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:84%
by our government, even at
the beginning of this time

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle line:84%
that you spent at Sandia
Labs inside Los Alamos.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
So, I kind of feel like
there's something missing here.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.010 align:middle line:84%
How much had you been briefed on
genetic hybridization programs

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.470 align:middle line:84%
before you ever started
this particular job

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.151 align:middle line:84%
with the so-called
salmon filets?

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH: Yeah,
I was not, actually.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.735 align:middle line:10%
I was a very low-classified
individual at that time.

00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it actually didn't
happen till about a year or two

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:84%
later, where because of
what I was dissecting

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.724 align:middle line:84%
or whatever led
to other briefings

00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:08.140 align:middle line:84%
that led to other briefings,
because a lot of these beings

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:90%
were connected to ships.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I got pulled
into that, then I

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:84%
was pulled into
other things that

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle line:90%
had to do with hybridization.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I was actually told
once that one of the samples

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.171 align:middle line:84%
was a hybrid, and
that's how I knew

00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:90%
they were doing hybridization.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.050 align:middle line:84%
They didn't hide that time
and during the briefing,

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.262 align:middle line:84%
and it was a group
briefing, so it was exposed.

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And what
was this sample?

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:90%
What was it a hybrid of?

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:90%
What did it look like?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It was
kind of like a tiger.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a tiger-type,
human-type being.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: The DNA had fur on it.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
It was very humanoid and only
stood about five feet tall.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And the way it looked
was very dismantled.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
It was not correctly
how you would

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.620 align:middle line:84%
think you would see
something like in a movie

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
or something, where it
has the perfect eye set,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:90%
the nose is perfectly aligned--

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
it was dysmorphed
very, very horribly.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot tell you what DNA
that were used to make this

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:90%
creature.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.449 align:middle line:84%
I could just tell you
what it looked like.

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:90%
You understand what I'm saying?

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.450 align:middle line:84%
It had the aspects of a
cat face like a tiger,

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and it had very
large green eyes.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And it had whiskers,
and the body

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:84%
was very small and very frail,
and it had just regular fur.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, we have seen
cases of people trying to breed

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
lions and tigers together and
different types of things.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And I remember noticing
that in some of those cases,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.661 align:middle line:84%
those animals have this
kind of disabled look.

00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Right, I
heard about this.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: They get these strange
deformities to their faces

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So, do you think this
was a failed prototype

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.317 align:middle line:90%
idea of some kind?

00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a total failed
prototype, because I don't

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.770 align:middle line:90%
know what that would serve--

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.645 align:middle line:90%
what they were doing.

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I think they were just trying,
which they have already

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:84%
been doing for many years I
know before I even came along

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
because of some of the things
that was released to me later

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:90%
on in the projects.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.960 align:middle line:84%
They were mixing all sorts
of DNA with human DNA,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
including plant DNA and
mammal DNA from other mammals

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:90%
from the oceans and sea.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What do you think
this tiger being could have been

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.260 align:middle line:90%
used for?

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.700 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I know it's speculation.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well,
speculation for me--

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:84%
total military type,
operative-type, super

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:90%
soldier-type programs.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Just as in the old
days, they would--

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and the Roman Empire have
mastiffs, hundreds of them.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
They found hundreds of
mass graves at big sites

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.151 align:middle line:84%
where they would be running
alongside the horses,

00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and the mastiffs would
jump on the people,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.126 align:middle line:84%
and the horsemen
would spear the guys.

00:04:04.126 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
They're just used to
knock down people.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So, this was probably used
to-- maybe some future war

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
or something-- to release all
these crazy hybrid-killing

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.750 align:middle line:90%
machines.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And studies in
humans, of course,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
first and then
send in the humans.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.161 align:middle line:84%
Or send in-- of course,
probably in the future,

00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it's going to be mostly
clones and drones that will

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:90%
be--

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
the war will be fought
inside a computer room.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: I kind of
asked you this before,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:10%
but I'm curious to get it
in a little more detail.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:10%
You said something about that
the clone might have memories

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:10%
loaded into its
mind so it believes

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:10%
that it has an identity that's
lived for however many years?

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:84%
They can program the
brain, because the brain

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:90%
is just not its own brain.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
It does have modulation to it
using very, very small sensors

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.070 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:90%
how can you say this--

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.950 align:middle line:90%
wiring.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Implants.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, implants
that stimulate certain parts

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And they can also
download it and make

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:84%
you believe that you are Marilyn
Monroe or you are David Wilcock

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.830 align:middle line:84%
or you are whoever,
and this is actually

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.625 align:middle line:84%
what has happened to you
in the past 25 years.

00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And you just wake
up in a bed one

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
day going to work or
someone's picking you up,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:90%
and that's all you will know.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: Is it possible
to store someone's memories

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.331 align:middle line:10%
and personality on a hard drive
actually as a data storage?

00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I haven't seen that.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:84%
I get that question asked a
lot, because of the movies

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:37.780 align:middle line:90%
out there--

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.821 align:middle line:84%
"Avatar" and things like
that, the consciousness.

00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
But I have not seen
that, because you

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:90%
would have to have the DNA.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that
you can only do it

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:84%
if they have your DNA,
because the DNA is everything

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
unfolded within the
universe, including

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
your specific matching
prototype of who you are

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and all the conscious
experiences you have.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm sure by
now they probably

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
have something that can store
your DNA for a very, very

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.690 align:middle line:84%
long period of time without
damaging that part of it

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:84%
that keeps the conscious
memory implanted into it.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: One of my other
insiders reported working

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
at a base which
seemed to be Area 51,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.004 align:middle line:90%
though he wouldn't say that.

00:06:18.004 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe at
one point he did.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:90%
He said S4, which is Area 51.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:10%
And he reported that they
had a dog that was, I guess,

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.470 align:middle line:10%
a desert dog that
showed up, and the dog

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:10%
started to have certain
quirks and certain tricks

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:10%
that it learned.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the dog died,
and they cloned it,

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:84%
because they liked the dog
so much they wanted it back.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered that
each clone had the memories

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:90%
of the preceding dog as well.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was as
if they started

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
to conclude that
the DNA was simply

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
some physical address for an
energetic consciousness that

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.140 align:middle line:90%
superseded DNA.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts on that?

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.253 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No, I agree with that.

00:06:55.253 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:84%
The DNA is just our
3D interpretation

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:90%
of the energy that is you.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So, the light body, I believe,
and all that is stored.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:84%
We call it DNA, because it's
what we're taught in science.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But really, it's in that field
of that molecule or whatever

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.266 align:middle line:84%
you want to call it-- a
tetrahedron or however...

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:90%
what your belief system is.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.169 align:middle line:84%
So, I do agree it is
an energetic thing.

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, he
referred to the DNA,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and they apparently refer to
it as like a tuning fork--

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.785 align:middle line:84%
that it tunes in this
energetic aspect of yourself.

00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Right,
this is a radio.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of a
device, kind of.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.579 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, how does that
interplay with programmed

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:31.378 align:middle line:90%
memories?

00:07:31.378 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
How could they give you a memory
that you didn't really have?

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.975 align:middle line:84%
Or is it more that they can make
the clone think that it's you

00:07:36.975 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and access your own
data bank of memory?

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, they have a--

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't part of that
program, but they

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:84%
do have something that does
exactly what you just said.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.612 align:middle line:84%
It somehow gives that DNA
or that energy frequency.

00:07:49.612 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Like when you talk about
the morphogenic field,

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
everyone's everywhere,
everything is everything.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:90%
So, that energy somehow--

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:84%
if I have an affinity to be
you, I will believe I'm you,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and I am you, because
we're each other.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:90%
We're everywhere.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is I
think they have somehow,

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:84%
someway found a way to
change that memory of who

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:84%
you were in the DNA using
that exact thing you said--

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:90%
a frequency in this field.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's just my speculation.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I did hear from my
secret space program insider,

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Jacob, who is very deeply
involved on many, many levels,

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.810 align:middle line:90%
claims to have been to--

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I believe he said over
2,000 off-planet locations

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:84%
through portals he
claims that he went to.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:90%
And he was very credible.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.650 align:middle line:84%
He said at one point
that certain elite people

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:90%
could have--

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:84%
there is apparently
a machine they

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.220 align:middle line:84%
have where they can
download your personality

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness into a
younger version of yourself--

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.860 align:middle line:84%
that you could be
transferred from one body

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.957 align:middle line:84%
to another as your
main host body.

00:08:54.957 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about that?

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I do not know
anything about that,

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
but I have seen them do
that with other beings.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm assuming
100% they can do

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.530 align:middle line:84%
that just through
some of the briefings

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
I've been in on of similar
consciousness movement--

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
of what you call
this downloading

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:90%
of your own personality field.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And so there's no
doubt in my mind.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe that is true,
but I have not seen that.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What is the reason
for why these cloned beings seem

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:90%
to have a shorter lifespan?

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I think any time
you take any type of cell--

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.090 align:middle line:84%
like we have problems
with stem cells right now.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:84%
When you take them
and you multiply them,

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:84%
there's a couple of them
that come out not too well.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So, the more you do
it, sometimes you

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:84%
have a little bit more problems
with the cells being mutatious.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:84%
They start mutating
into different things,

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.230 align:middle line:84%
not what we thought
they were going to be.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So, there must be something in
the field that only allows us

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
to maybe, or we just haven't
perfected it here yet.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it's
been perfected up there.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So, I think it has
something to do with that.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's not
supposed to be done,

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and that there's an
unhealthier clone every time

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:90%
you clone someone.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:90%
When you do it that way.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: If we go back to some
of the vintage whistleblowers

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
like Bill Uhouse, it
appears that from whoever--

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.370 align:middle line:90%
and it might be the Cabal--

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:84%
a narrative was
presented with the idea

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:84%
that the greys are humans
from the future who

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:84%
had their population greatly
reduced after a catastrophe,

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and that they now have
been cloning themselves.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's like
multiple photocopies,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:90%
it starts to get damaged--

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.230 align:middle line:84%
that this funny thing they
do is diabetic neuropathy.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the neuropathy
from genetic cloning,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and that they're coming back
to do these abductions to try

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.290 align:middle line:90%
to bolster their genetic stock.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think that
kind of a narrative

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
would be created
if it's not true?

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.579 align:middle line:84%
What would be the
objective there?

00:10:56.579 --> 00:10:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I couldn't
comment on that,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know
of this exact story.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I could just tell you that if
they're real extraterrestrials

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and they're cloning each
other, they're probably

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.650 align:middle line:90%
pretty perfect specimens.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And they would have
already figured

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:84%
out how to fix those
mutations 100%.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
If they're not real
specimens and they

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:84%
were escaped hybrids
that formed their own

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and got smart enough to learn
and form their own civilization

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:84%
up there and want to take
over Earth or something,

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.220 align:middle line:84%
then that would be a possibility
that they're failing.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: We have seen
a lot of reports--

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:84%
if you go back again into
more vintage ufology--

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.990 align:middle line:84%
of people describing
something called a neonate.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is where, if a fetus
is allowed to develop without

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:84%
the pressure of
the womb around it,

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
that the head will largely
increase in size and you will

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:84%
end up with a being that
will retain fetal proportions

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.880 align:middle line:84%
into adulthood, which is
exactly what a grey looks like.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So, some ufologists
have speculated

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that greys could be
humans that simply

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:84%
have been grown in some
kind of a vat or a tube

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.589 align:middle line:90%
instead of in a womb.

00:12:13.589 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts on that?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, it
is a possibility.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
extraterrestrials could

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:84%
have hybrid human DNA in
them for sure and vice versa.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So, I definitely believe in
that, because it's been done.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:90%
It's been done.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Were you aware
of any other being like

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:84%
the tiger-human hybrid that was
a hybrid program that you were

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.800 align:middle line:84%
directly briefed on or
allowed to see a specimen of?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, there
was one that was kind of

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:90%
like a manatee-type version.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, a
manatee-type, walrus-type,

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:84%
seal-type phenotype there that
they were utilizing that had

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
a very, very weird look to
it-- also was disproportionate

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:90%
and was dead upon seeing it.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I believe that was part of a
project where they were mixing

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.301 align:middle line:90%
mammalian with human DNA.

00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they
were going to do with it,

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:84%
but it looked like a manatee
but upright with arms and hands.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, just to
follow on that for a second,

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:84%
are you familiar with
there being any bases that

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
our government or the Cabal
might have that would be under

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.450 align:middle line:90%
the ocean?

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.784 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And how would that
work based on what you know?

00:13:30.784 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
How would you build
a base at the bottom

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:90%
of the ocean, let's say?

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, there's bases
that were already there that

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:84%
they took over that have been
here for millions of years that

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.050 align:middle line:84%
were already functional,
and they found these bases

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:84%
in different parts
and different areas.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And most of the bases
are not just like bubbles

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.400 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of an ocean.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:84%
They're actually under
the ocean's crust.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So, that's how they
really bore in there.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And they build it
from underneath up.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't go down
from the surface

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean with a bunch of
two-by-fours and steel parts.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a very complex,
very advanced way

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:90%
to make an underground sea lab.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.775 align:middle line:84%
Sea labs exist all
over the world.

00:14:08.775 --> 00:14:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: That's what
it's called, a sea lab?

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Sea labs are
all over the world.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Very small-- you
might see a small one

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:20.250 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom of the
ocean, but underneath that

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:90%
is really where the base is.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.160 align:middle line:84%
It's underneath the
crust of the bottom

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.840 align:middle line:90%
of the ocean and the rock.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, by digging down
first and then working from

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.360 align:middle line:84%
the bottom up, does that prevent
against erosion and cataclysms

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing?

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.335 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I think it's probably
the safest way to do it without

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.700 align:middle line:90%
being noticed.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's a secrecy thing.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.814 align:middle line:84%
After what happened many, many
years ago with the Taos hums,

00:14:43.814 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
they were worried that
people were catching on

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
with what they were doing
with making these tunnels.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But now they're using a
different type of technique.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Of course, as you know, they
make big lava tubes and melt

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.234 align:middle line:90%
rock and....

00:14:56.234 --> 00:14:57.900 align:middle line:84%
they don't use the
old-fashioned drills.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:84%
You see these pictures of
these ancient drill bits that

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:90%
are like 150 feet in diameter.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:90%
That's old school.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:11.310 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: Some skeptics might
say that we barely even have

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:10%
the ability to get any
submarine that far down.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:84%
The pressure would crush
any type of technology.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So, how have they overcome those
limitations of the pressure?

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, no.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:90%
They don't use submarines.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
They use our own alien
reproduction vehicles.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:84%
We form our own
gravitational force.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
We're inside our
own gravity field,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:90%
so we cannot get crushed.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why you can go
to space, and that's

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.287 align:middle line:84%
why you see some of these
UFOs and these other ones

00:15:40.287 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
just go right into the
water and keep going.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.786 align:middle line:84%
Because they're in
their own environment

00:15:43.786 --> 00:15:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and their own gravity,
so it would be easy

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:84%
for them to transport people
or equipment or whatnot.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But they always
have a direct link

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.454 align:middle line:84%
to these tunnels is
what it's all about,

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and there's many tunnels
all around the world.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:01.380 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: And they can generate
enough gravity that they can

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:10%
easily counteract the
pressure of the ocean?

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, absolutely.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.623 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they can
transdimensionally

00:16:06.623 --> 00:16:09.870 align:middle line:90%
change the size of themselves.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.289 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: How would that work?

00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, they
kind of dematerialize,

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.038 align:middle line:90%
but you're still there.

00:16:14.038 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
But you're just out of
this frequency just a hair,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.362 align:middle line:84%
so you don't fall under the laws
of the science of this planet.

00:16:22.362 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is for
every other planet.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.153 align:middle line:90%
That's why they can go anywhere.

00:16:25.153 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
They can go right
through the Earth.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:90%
You can fly right in the craft.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going towards the
tree, because that's

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.500 align:middle line:90%
where I want to go.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I see
that tree, the craft

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:90%
changes interdimensionally.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It can shrink itself or change
its frequency just a little

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:84%
bit different, so
the structure of it

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:84%
will just go through
it or around it.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
how they do it.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Do you think that
these manatee people could

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
possibly have been bred to be
able to do work in the ocean?

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that was just a
scientific experiment gone bad.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:90%
I think they were trying to--

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:84%
they were probably looking at
other more intelligent mammals,

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:84%
but they were starting
with different ones.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.889 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
they picked that.

00:17:10.889 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even tell you.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.471 align:middle line:84%
I've been saying
what it looked like.

00:17:13.471 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it
was manatee DNA,

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm just hypothesizing
because of the way it looked--

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle line:84%
like this type of
face and the skin,

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:90%
and it was very interesting.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:84%
There are dolphin-like
extraterrestrial type people

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.045 align:middle line:84%
that have evolved beyond
us that have come back

00:17:33.045 --> 00:17:36.641 align:middle line:84%
and dropped off their
lineage of dolphins here.

00:17:36.641 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: It does seem
interesting to me, Emery,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.490 align:middle line:84%
that in the early,
early maritime era,

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:84%
there were sightings of people
claiming that they saw human

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:90%
aquatic hybrids of some kind.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:10%
And that almost
universally is written off

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:10%
as if the sailors were
just drinking or something

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:10%
or that they saw manatees.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But yet, you've seen
line art illustrations

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:84%
of people who drew these
things from the craft.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And you see, for example, a
being that has a human face,

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.470 align:middle line:84%
but it almost has
flippers coming out

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.190 align:middle line:84%
for arms and flippers coming
out for legs, almost like it's

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:90%
a scaly type of thing as well.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So, do you think that
maybe at that early era

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
before we really started
to explore the oceans

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that these ETs had more free
will to be in our oceans

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.650 align:middle line:90%
without violating our free will?

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, yes.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I believe many
thousands and thousands

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
years ago that there

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:84%
was a race of extraterrestrials
that lived in the ocean

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and have maybe even migrated
into inner Earth oceans now.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.690 align:middle line:84%
We refer to them as
the "Aquifarians,"

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and they come from
another water planet.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And there actually are many
different water planets.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure too much more
than that about them or how

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.710 align:middle line:90%
they live or anything.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But I just know
about that, because I

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:84%
have seen some
briefings of this race,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and I've also physically
seen things in the ocean that

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:90%
resemble these types of beings.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.200 align:middle line:90%
What exactly does it look like?

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Could you be a
little more specific?

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:90%
It looks like you said.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a human form,
and it's fishy.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very beautiful
face with long, long hair.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:84%
There are men and women
of these types of beings,

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:90%
and they can walk.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.940 align:middle line:10%
They're not like the mermaids
we see with these fins,

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.930 align:middle line:10%
but they do have fins on the
outside of the body, kind

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.080 align:middle line:10%
of like a cuttlefish.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:90%
You know what a cuttlefish is?

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
They have these fins
around the outside

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.540 align:middle line:84%
of the body that allow them to
propel themselves very, very

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:90%
fast.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:06.164 align:middle line:84%
And they're very strong, and
they're very tall beings.

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, one of the
things that is very interesting

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:90%
to bring up here--

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.230 align:middle line:84%
having traveled in Japan
for 3 and 1/2 weeks,

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.780 align:middle line:84%
there are very, very
extensive records

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.490 align:middle line:90%
of a being called a kappa--

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
K-A-P-P-A. And this is
essentially an aquatic

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:21.820 align:middle line:90%
humanoid.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:84%
It's intelligent, it
can speak our language,

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and they would actually
abduct and kill children.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So, children were
always warned not

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:84%
to go near the water
because of the kappa.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.474 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, the
kappa would come out,

00:20:37.474 --> 00:20:38.640 align:middle line:90%
and they would taunt people.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:84%
They would talk to them,
they would make jokes,

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.215 align:middle line:90%
they would make rude noises.

00:20:43.215 --> 00:20:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And the other strange
thing about the kappa--

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:90%
just to finish this off--

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
is that apparently-- and this
is very consistent of all

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.310 align:middle line:90%
the Japanese reports--

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:84%
that they had this indentation
on the top of their head

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.590 align:middle line:84%
about one cup
size, and that they

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:90%
needed to have water in it.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:90%
And that if the water fell out--

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:84%
if you could convince
them to bow down

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.517 align:middle line:84%
like this and the
water comes out--

00:21:02.517 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:84%
they would actually die
very quickly if they

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:90%
couldn't get back to the water.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:84%
This is a widespread
Japanese legend.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So, what do you think the kappa
might be, just speculating?

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: You're talking
ancient times, correct?

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:14.764 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Not really.

00:21:14.764 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe only a few
hundred years ago.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Because this
definitely sounds like a kind

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:84%
of hybrid-gone-wrong-type
situation

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:90%
because of the water--

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.730 align:middle line:84%
what you mentioned
about the water.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.100 align:middle line:84%
There's many things
that they make

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:84%
to try to live on the Earth,
but when you start mixing DNA--

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.880 align:middle line:84%
especially with aquatics--
it doesn't work out

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:84%
too well because of the
oxygen and the water

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:84%
that these beings
need to survive.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:84%
You know how fish have gills
and sharks and whatnot?

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And they rely more on
these other animals

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.790 align:middle line:84%
that can gulp air and hold
their breaths for 24 hours,

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:56.290 align:middle line:84%
like certain kinds of catfish
and salamanders and whatnot.

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So, I think I don't know
anything about that story,

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.220 align:middle line:84%
but it does ring some bells
on some other projects that

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.620 align:middle line:84%
have gone wrong as far
as trying to keep beings

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
that they make be able to
be in the water and land.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the super soldier being--

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go there,
to be able to survive

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.850 align:middle line:84%
the vacuum of space like
some organisms we have here,

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to survive
on its own without help,

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:90%
but to be able to be controlled.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Do you think that
there are Earth-like planets

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:84%
that are water worlds that
don't have land that comes above

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.390 align:middle line:84%
the surface, and the whole
planet is an ocean basically?

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I believe in
that definitely, yes.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So, is it possible that a
humanoid intelligent species

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:84%
could evolve on that planet
by evolving in the ocean?

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Absolutely, yes.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Now, the funny part
was that I've watched some

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.614 align:middle line:90%
scientists speculate on this.

00:22:53.614 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, intelligent
life couldn't form in an ocean,

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.980 align:middle line:84%
because they'd have to
be able to make fire,

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't burn
anything in the water.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: That's
pretty ignorant.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of species here
that are living quite fine

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.546 align:middle line:84%
that are more
conscious than we are.

00:23:09.546 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Just because we
can't communicate

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.500 align:middle line:84%
with them doesn't mean
we should alienate them,

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:90%
just like dolphins.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their brains are a
little bit bigger than ours.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.428 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole
thing with everything else

00:23:19.428 --> 00:23:20.670 align:middle line:90%
is about communication.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:84%
It's so sad that just because we
can't communicate with someone

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
that we have our
differences, or we

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.050 align:middle line:84%
make them look like they're
smaller than we are.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.484 align:middle line:84%
That's something
that needs to go.

00:23:29.484 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Why do you think
the kappa might have died

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.084 align:middle line:84%
if the water fell out of
this little cup in its head--

00:23:34.084 --> 00:23:35.250 align:middle line:90%
this cup-shaped indentation?

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I would say it has to
do with voltage because of how

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.230 align:middle line:84%
the salt water of the body
can't have a special voltage.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think he needs the voltage
to keep running in the body.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe it has
anything to do with breathing

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.500 align:middle line:84%
or anything else, because
they would not have risked

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:90%
that to come upon the shore.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But that voltage-- because
every living creature gives off

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:84%
a type of voltage or a
frequency, and it's alive.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Now, we've heard
a lot of reports about

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:90%
the Philadelphia Experiment.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get into the
scientist Gerry Vassilatos,

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.440 align:middle line:84%
he reported that at
Norfolk Naval Shipyard

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:84%
they were doing
these major welding

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:84%
operations for battleships
around World War II.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And that when they
did the arc welding,

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:84%
they would see this
huge flash of light,

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and then all the
power would go off.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.086 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't understand
why this was happening.

00:24:29.086 --> 00:24:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they
do a high-speed film,

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and they found that
this hole would appear--

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.850 align:middle line:90%
like a black hole--

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and tools and objects would
be flying into the hole

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.830 align:middle line:90%
before the power shut down.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And this apparently was
what led to the development

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Philadelphia Experiment,
where allegedly a ship was

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:84%
transported from Virginia
up to around Philadelphia--

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.030 align:middle line:84%
hence Philadelphia Experiment--
and then back to Virginia.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Are we looking at, do you
think, an early prototype

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.980 align:middle line:84%
example of what later
became a portal technology

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:84%
where all the kinks
got smoothed out?

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Is that what the Philadelphia
Experiment might be?

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Portals exist.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
science into portals

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that we have done without using
certain Earth grid points.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.320 align:middle line:84%
As far as that
specific, I would have

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:84%
to know a little bit more
information of what they were

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.050 align:middle line:84%
using to weld and
a lot of the energy

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.825 align:middle line:84%
going into that and the fields
of electromagnetic energy.

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: It was very, very high
voltage electrostatic welding.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, that's
what you need to do that.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So, it could very
possibly be that that's

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.810 align:middle line:84%
how they were teletransported
to the other side

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.840 align:middle line:90%
or had a device to do that.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.330 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: Why do you think
the soldiers ended up getting

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.820 align:middle line:10%
embedded in the hull of
the ship as was reported?

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.610 align:middle line:84%
What might have
caused that to happen?

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Oh, just a
glitch in the system.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.912 align:middle line:90%
It happens all the time.

00:25:51.912 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:84%
We lose lots of
people in portals.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.670 align:middle line:84%
We haven't mastered
it very well.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.711 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: We still haven't
mastered it very well?

00:25:57.711 --> 00:25:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No, we have not.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.670 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:84%
We've done it, but
it's not 100% safe.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: But nothing
is, like driving a car.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: So, another thing that
you told me that I thought was

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.360 align:middle line:10%
really interesting-- and I feel
like it's a good time to touch

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:10%
on this-- is you mentioned to
me in private conversation that

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.580 align:middle line:10%
the locations of where we chose
to build military bases might

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:10%
not be totally arbitrary.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the hidden reasons

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.994 align:middle line:84%
for why certain bases
are where they are?

00:26:32.994 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, not all the
bases, but a few bases--

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:90%
like I told you earlier--

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:84%
were built on certain
grid points on the planet,

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.480 align:middle line:84%
because they were built on top
of other ancient bases that

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.795 align:middle line:90%
were there.

00:26:43.795 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of those
ancient bases already

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.131 align:middle line:84%
had working energy devices
and alien craft and portals.

00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, they would
literally be able to just dig

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.295 align:middle line:84%
right down into that
base and re-occupy it?

00:26:55.295 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well,
not re-occupy it,

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
but study it and
reverse engineer it.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if they were
building certain portals

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:84%
or certain other
devices, they would

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:84%
make sure it was put
on that same grid point

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.910 align:middle line:84%
or try to activate certain
portals that are there.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:90%
In the early years--

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:17.070 align:middle line:90%
you know, '40s, '50s--

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.440 align:middle line:84%
they had a lot of bases
going out west and stuff

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and exploring things
using special radars

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.460 align:middle line:84%
to look underneath the Earth
which have been improved today.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.550 align:middle line:84%
They would pick these
specific points,

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and this is where they
would set up labs.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Sandia Labs is actually on
Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Los Alamos labs
is north of that,

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:90%
but they're all connected.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So, I do believe around
the world-- not just here,

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.496 align:middle line:84%
but also military bases
in other countries--

00:27:45.496 --> 00:27:47.370 align:middle line:84%
after looking at them
and lining them all up,

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:51.300 align:middle line:84%
do fall on interesting
grid points.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
many spectacles

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:84%
of different phenomena
that comes out

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.070 align:middle line:84%
of these bases that are
witnessed by civilians

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:90%
in these specific points.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, you're saying,
then, that in certain cases,

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:09.750 align:middle line:84%
a military base might be built
over a wrecked extraterrestrial

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:84%
vehicle that's
underground somewhere?

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Absolutely, or a base
that has already been there

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.410 align:middle line:84%
from ancient times or from
extraterrestrials that

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.499 align:middle line:90%
abandoned it.

00:28:20.499 --> 00:28:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: This does line up with
some other intel that we got

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.440 align:middle line:90%
from other folks.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So, are there certain
cases where the craft

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:90%
itself would be very large--

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:90%
like very unusually large?

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Very
large, absolutely.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Kirtland Air Force
Base is the fifth largest land

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.460 align:middle line:84%
base in the world,
and you have to look

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:84%
at a lot of different parameters
when you're trying to associate

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and balance all the different
bases if you're really

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.010 align:middle line:90%
into this kind of thing.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:53.340 align:middle line:84%
There's craft that are
very, very, very, very

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.490 align:middle line:84%
large that's stuck in
the crust of our Earth.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen the photos.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.450 align:middle line:84%
We use a very
special type of radar

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:05.820 align:middle line:84%
that's classified that's
400 times more greater

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.130 align:middle line:90%
resolution than a CAT scan.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And it has a backflow
of frequency energy

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.836 align:middle line:84%
that measures the time of
how that frequency comes back

00:29:16.836 --> 00:29:18.210 align:middle line:84%
to tell us exactly
what it is was

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:90%
to build a volumetric image.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Yeah.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And you actually
showed me some of that.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.300 align:middle line:84%
It's probably not for
public distribution,

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.120 align:middle line:84%
but you showed me some
very, very interesting stuff

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:84%
at one point of what appears
to be an underground site that

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.850 align:middle line:84%
is definitely not
known to the public.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of these craft can be
anywhere from eight feet

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.010 align:middle line:90%
wide to 33 miles long.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of the structures
underneath the ground

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:90%
could be just as big--

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.510 align:middle line:84%
10 times larger than
the Giza pyramids.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: But are
pyramids in some cases?

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Right, in
that kind of shape.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Or reverse pyramids,
like tetrahedrons-- one

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.350 align:middle line:90%
on the other going backwards.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Very amazing shapes and
very deep in the Earth

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and with many
things inside them.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, let's say
we have, as one example,

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.870 align:middle line:84%
a 33-mile-wide
craft underground.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.710 align:middle line:10%
How many staff
might be dedicated

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.950 align:middle line:10%
to exploring just that one
thing, and for how long might

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:10%
that have been happening if
you say an entire base is built

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.672 align:middle line:10%
there where the good stuff is.

00:30:28.672 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It could take many,
many, many, many, many, many,

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:36.040 align:middle line:90%
many, many, years for that to--

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.480 align:middle line:84%
it's not like you just
break into a tomb,

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and there's the mummy, and OK,
and everyone just pillages it

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.810 align:middle line:90%
They're very careful with it.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And just like in Antarctica
with what's going on down there,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
it would take a team to probably
research that kind of base--

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll say it's a craft,
I'll say base underground.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
parameters, like how deep

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.530 align:middle line:84%
it is, what kind
of rock is in it,

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.600 align:middle line:90%
how we're going to get there.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing
they'll do first

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.720 align:middle line:90%
is all this volumetric imaging.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
plan out, and they'll

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.170 align:middle line:90%
recreate it on the Earth first.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So, they'll actually map
whatever they see and make

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:22.660 align:middle line:84%
a model of it, exact
spec, on top of the Earth

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.660 align:middle line:84%
or under a ground base where
they can do this secretly

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:90%
to see exactly what's there.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
it's not going to be--

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.360 align:middle line:84%
so, when the team
goes, now they're

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.290 align:middle line:90%
using virtual reality to do it.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:34.930 align:middle line:84%
So, when the team
goes in, they know

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:39.450 align:middle line:84%
where they're at inside this
area of the craft or whatnot.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:42.550 align:middle line:10%
Is there still energy
there on the craft?

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Is it still on?

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Is there beings there?

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.780 align:middle line:84%
If they are, are they alive,
or are they in a cryo state?

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.640 align:middle line:84%
These are the
things that they do.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So, they're very, very specific
about before going in and just

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:90%
digging everything up.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not like this
general thing--

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.959 align:middle line:90%
get in there and just dig this--

00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:02.250 align:middle line:90%
get all the backhoes and do it.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.830 align:middle line:84%
It's more like it's very calm,
let's figure this out first.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.830 align:middle line:84%
This is very dangerous, we don't
know what we're getting into.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.910 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand there
might be microbes in there that

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:84%
come out and infect
the entire planet,

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:21.070 align:middle line:84%
so vacuum tunnels have to be
made with negative pressure air

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:90%
systems and stuff.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a very dynamic and
a very huge undertaking.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:30.220 align:middle line:84%
It could take 20, 50,
100 years to do a project

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.290 align:middle line:84%
like that with all
those parameters I

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:34.410 align:middle line:90%
said that are involved.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, I would be
remiss to end this episode

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.900 align:middle line:84%
without just asking
this quickly,

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.520 align:middle line:84%
which would be are you
confirming the presence

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.610 align:middle line:84%
of at least one very large
mothership under the ice

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:46.570 align:middle line:90%
in Antarctica?

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:84%
We have got a lot
of other testimony

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.250 align:middle line:84%
on this-- from Pete
Peterson, from Corey Goode,

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:55.930 align:middle line:84%
other insiders I've
spoken to as well.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.138 align:middle line:84%
You and I have actually
never even spoken about that,

00:32:58.138 --> 00:33:00.021 align:middle line:84%
so it's kind of
amazing that you would

00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:01.270 align:middle line:90%
have heard about this as well.

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: You know, it
won't be the people.

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:07.120 align:middle line:90%
It won't be us exposing this.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.360 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
Earth that exposes it

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.320 align:middle line:90%
because of the warmth.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.700 align:middle line:84%
They can't fight
the heat right now.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And since they can't
fight the heat,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.850 align:middle line:84%
it's going be really hard to
explain when some of the snow

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:84%
melts in the next year,
and this giant thing

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.430 align:middle line:84%
starts being exposed
and different metals.

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:28.600 align:middle line:90%
So, Gaia will be disclosure.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.882 align:middle line:84%
Earth will be the
one who discloses

00:33:30.882 --> 00:33:31.840 align:middle line:90%
it, which is beautiful.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, we're
going to help Gaia.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, we're
going to help Gaia.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Gaia's
going to help Gaia.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:36.211 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:33:36.211 --> 00:33:37.543 align:middle line:90%
But you get what I'm getting at.

00:33:37.543 --> 00:33:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that beautiful?

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: That is amazing.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.070 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't want to leave
it on that cliff hanger.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:43.720 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back next time.
