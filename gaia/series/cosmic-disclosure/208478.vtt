>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
we're at an undisclosed
location with Tim.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Technologies of tomorrow.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be a super
fantastic and interesting

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.123 align:middle line:90%
and fun episode.

00:00:45.123 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: A lot of
our viewers have

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.390 align:middle line:84%
been wondering about
advanced technologies

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and special projects that
you've been made aware of.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.700 align:middle line:84%
What can you share with
us today about that?

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I think we can start
with technologies where

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure people will
see them in the next few years,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:84%
because they are essential to
the stability of this planet.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And one thing for sure
that will come pretty soon

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:84%
is medical technology, because
a level 3 consciousness being

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
is more about dissecting
and ripping off

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:84%
things and repairing it
mechanically like a mechanic

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:84%
would repair a car, while
a level 4 being, which

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:84%
has a consciousness on
level 4, realizes that there

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
are frequencies and more subtle,
non-invasive ways in order

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to repair structures
in the human body.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that people are
already doing that very low key

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
on this planet by meditation,
by visualizing the repair

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:90%
system, which is great.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:84%
It basically means getting
your consciousness, which

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.220 align:middle line:84%
is one part of the triad,
in contact and communication

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:90%
with your own body.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.980 align:middle line:84%
But there are also technologies
that do that for you.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this a handheld
scanner or something else?

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen it?

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Different species
have different technologies

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and different
styles to use that.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.960 align:middle line:90%
It might come more handy.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:90%
It might be a huge apparatus.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But the mechanics
is the same at all

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:84%
of these basic levels
of technology, which

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:84%
means to put information into
the body, how things needs

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.250 align:middle line:84%
to be repaired, and then
accelerate the speed of healing

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and putting nutrition in it so
it can use this to repair it.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Some previous guests
have mentioned med beds.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about this?

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So a med bed would
be something that I

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
assume will come pretty soon to
the technology level of Earth,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
because it has so
many advantages.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And also, this species
and everyone in charge

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
is relying on perfectly
working bodies.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So instead of having
this industry that

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
keeps people in some
kind of chaotic healing

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
process for years
or months, this

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
is something that people
go to, they get repaired,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and then they can attribute
their effectiveness

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
to the mutual benefit
of the species.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other medical
technologies do you know about?

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Some species are
using light in order

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
to repair, which
means, as we know,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:84%
this version of the universe
is basically light-based.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Everything radiates
particles of light.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
consistent of light.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.430 align:middle line:84%
This is also why the
ancient people way back

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:84%
used to worship the sun as a
direct embodiment of source,

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:90%
which it is.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's also the reason
why the universe, when

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
we or it or whatever
you want to call it,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:84%
when the universe found out
that there is a spot that

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:84%
can be observed, they used
the speed of light in order

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:84%
to make this accessible
and observable.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Everything is about the observer
and everything is about light.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So when everything
is about light,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:84%
everything is kind
of a biological form

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:90%
of holographic universe.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And that can be used in
order to alter the form

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.390 align:middle line:90%
and the projection of a body.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And also, in order to repair
structures of the body.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, our guests have
also talked about the ability

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
to extract soul
energy and place it

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:90%
in another physical container.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.477 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about this?

00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: The Greys are doing that.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:84%
The Greys extract the soul and
the consciousness awareness

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
of a consciousness
unit from an experience

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and put it into some kind
of collective memory system

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
in order to reuse it
in some other context.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you know
about nanotechnology?

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Nanotechnology
might be something

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that might be a link between
this frequency and non-invasive

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.450 align:middle line:84%
technology that we
see in the future.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It is super expensive
compared to what

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:90%
you could call a med bed.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So an enhancement of
the free capabilities

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.590 align:middle line:90%
of the body to heal itself.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So you use some
kind of technology

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:84%
that is capable to
move in your body

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:90%
and to fulfill certain tasks.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of nanotechnology.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's not
price-effective compared

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:90%
to other technologies.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:84%
It might be something that
we will see on this Earth

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.250 align:middle line:84%
in order to find
the logic for having

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.632 align:middle line:90%
a more advanced medical system.

00:06:43.632 --> 00:06:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: These
medical technologies

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
you observed, were
they used and developed

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:90%
for humans or for ETs?

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Every species
that has reached

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:84%
that point of evolution
or development

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:90%
has used them on their species.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's not different.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It's about what image you put,
what data you put into the body

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.350 align:middle line:90%
in order to repair it.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a human body,
you need the correct data

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:90%
to put it into the body.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So the most impressive
thing that I've seen

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
was a kind of vibrational plate
that everyone in that society

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:84%
went to, stand up on
it, and it repairs

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.840 align:middle line:84%
by the field of frequency
the field of frequency

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:90%
inside of your body.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So actually, even though
you perceive yourself

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:84%
as a material body,
you are basically

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
a wavelength of light, of
different particle movements

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So if something on your body
is unhealthy or incorrect,

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:07.440 align:middle line:84%
that means at that point the
particles are not in line

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and moving the way
they should be.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And this
electromagnetic plate is

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:84%
using the movement
of the particles

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:84%
in order to repair your
body, which is great.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
It even goes that
far that you can

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:33.720 align:middle line:84%
use it to uplift your own
energetical feeling a lot.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.090 align:middle line:84%
There's also something
that the universe

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.480 align:middle line:84%
needs to deal with at another
level of consciousness.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.318 align:middle line:84%
This is pretty raw on
Earth, because people--

00:08:43.318 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream human is not
that much into that idea.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:90%
They do not think about that.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:84%
But every time we consume
something, we eat something,

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.220 align:middle line:84%
we actually-- the universe
is eating itself, basically.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is called
ouroboros, I guess,

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:84%
in the Greek mythology, which
means the snake eating itself.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:84%
But this is a problem to
the universe and a paradox,

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and it needs to be figured
out, because every time you

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:84%
eat something, it's A,
invasive and destructive,

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%
self-destructive
to the universe.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And B, meaning that you
are applying something

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.780 align:middle line:84%
to your body which is not
actually supposed to be there.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:84%
A banana that gives you
the nutrition and energy

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
to, I don't know, repair
your body is not your body.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.020 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Even if you put it
there and everything

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:50.595 align:middle line:84%
will be done to take healthy
nutrition from it and waste,

00:09:50.595 --> 00:09:56.520 align:middle line:84%
get rid of the rest, that is
not the most effective way

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to sustain your body,
and this is something

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:84%
that higher elevated
species need to deal with.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:84%
The Earth has
different challenges

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and different
problems at this time.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that people
will give up on food.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.950 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
that's important

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and that needs to
be figured out.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I think people that turn to
the sun and do this meditative

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and receiving energy from
the sun, which is possible

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:84%
and working, is some
kind of approach to that.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:36.430 align:middle line:84%
But other species, for
example, use other technology

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:90%
in order to generate food.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:84%
But this species
I'm talking about,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.720 align:middle line:84%
they use this vibrational
frequency plate

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:84%
in order to restore every
nutrition and every kind

00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
of food necessity in the body
and to restore their energy.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So Tim, what
type of technologies

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.460 align:middle line:84%
have you seen in
the field of travel?

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The most fundamental
part of all these technologies

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:84%
is that the universe
is connected to one

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:90%
point at every other point.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:84%
That makes travel even over
huge distances easy, or easier.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Which means you need to
access the possibility

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:84%
to connect one part
with the other part,

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and then either physically
or, hmm, in consciousness

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
go through that and
appear somewhere else.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:90%
There are three ways to that.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.470 align:middle line:84%
The first way is
occurring naturally.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So there are natural occurring
stargates from one point

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
to another point
in the universe.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
This can happen outside of
Earth, but it also can happen,

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and it is happening, on
the surface level of Earth.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Lots of sites from
the ancient people

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:84%
are using those natural
occurring wave patterns that

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.560 align:middle line:84%
are useful in order to create
a connection between two

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:90%
points of the universe.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.420 align:middle line:90%
The second level is--

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.440 align:middle line:84%
or the second way is to
use technology for that.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:31.510 align:middle line:84%
That could create this kind
of stargate wherever you want.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And the third level-- and
that is really interesting,

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for everyone, because
essentially on this planet

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:44.050 align:middle line:84%
we have this specialty that
some technologies are limited

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to some people and some
other people do not

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:90%
have access to that.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.560 align:middle line:84%
There is always the
opportunity and possibility

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:84%
for a consciousness unit
to reconnect with source.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And by that,
consciously deciding

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%
to be at a different
place at a different time.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Possibly that means that the
way your body is perceived,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:84%
some memory loss will occur,
which means memories that

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:84%
are specially dedicated
or specially linked

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
to the experience you have right
now will possibly get lost.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that you
don't have a body where you go,

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:84%
because the universe
always finds a way in order

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.790 align:middle line:84%
to operate to give you
some kind of new body.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it needs to
find a logic to that,

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:84%
giving you the sense
of being reborn.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
But none of us has ever made
that experience to be born.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just we are here,
and wherever we have been

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:90%
is not where we are now.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:90%
We are now here.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
same technique that

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:84%
can be used through
realization of a level 6

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
consciousness of
nothingness and awareness

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:84%
in order to move yourself
to a certain other point

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient history,
people were kind of using--

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.060 align:middle line:84%
so this is something
the Greys said,

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
that they were using marked
stones as a reminder,

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring yourself
to certain places.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:90%
They called those rune stones.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:90%
They have those in Germany.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
But they remind consciousness
and remind yourself

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:90%
where you want to go.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:90%
You don't need the technology.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:15:00.680 align:middle line:84%
You can use any logic to that
functionality of the universe

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:90%
that you want.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But this is some kind of
material transformation

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that you could use spiritually
and mentally in order

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to move yourself to somewhere
else in the universe.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned
Tesla, and Tesla

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:84%
has been known for working
with zero-point energy.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
you can speak of?

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The Greys are definitely
using zero-point energy.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
This is one part
of the secret why

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.050 align:middle line:84%
they can operate all
those drones or puppet

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:90%
bodies all over the place.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
They do not need some kind
of battery or recharge.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They just function
through the energy

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that the so-called zero-point
field is operating upon.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How far back in
time have these crafts

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.220 align:middle line:90%
been visiting our planet?

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the Greys
are using mainly two

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:84%
kind of crafts, which
is a disk-shaped craft,

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:90%
and B, a Tic Tac form.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Those two are the main
operating geometrical forms

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.800 align:middle line:90%
that they use for the craft.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: By the Tic
Tac, you're referring

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:84%
to the Navy crafts or the
extraterrestrial pill-shaped

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.100 align:middle line:90%
crafts?

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.267 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: No, I think we're
talking about the ones that

00:16:26.267 --> 00:16:30.560 align:middle line:10%
are on those videos that
the Navy were putting out.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So those
Tic Tac Navy videos

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.040 align:middle line:84%
are of the Greys
or something else?

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The video went through
a lot of post-production,

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.740 align:middle line:84%
so it's super blurry
and black and white

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and have this
mosaic effect on it.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not 100%
clear what is used.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:84%
But from the form and
from what can be seen,

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:84%
this is some technology that
could be linked to the Greys.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think--

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:90%
and I'd say that clearly--

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:07.400 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys are
operating in the way

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:84%
we see it on camera, like
playing cat and mouse in order

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:90%
to have a releasable video.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are your
thoughts on the Greys

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:90%
and their visitations?

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I'm saying that at this
moment, the Earth is locked up.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
There is no occurrence that
has not the correct paperwork

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's no random
or self-decided action

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:84%
being taken from the Greys
without having the stamp on it

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and having the
admission to do so.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think
the Tic Tac in the media

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:54.430 align:middle line:84%
is a back-engineered ET
technology used for a photo

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:55.510 align:middle line:90%
opportunity?

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It's a photo and
video opportunity in order

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:84%
to bring forward a topic that is
relevant for big and huge parts

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:84%
of the population while
people from the audience

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
here are so much more
prepared and have so much more

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:84%
knowledge about those
phenomena that they

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:22.560 align:middle line:84%
don't need the material
in this basic form.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:84%
They need some deeper knowledge,
maybe some more details

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.413 align:middle line:84%
in order to be prepared
for what's coming.

00:18:30.413 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are these
back-engineered

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:84%
craft our technology
or ET technology

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.750 align:middle line:90%
that we have access to?

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I'd say it's
a stage maneuver that

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:84%
has been played out in order
to have video material that

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:84%
is of interest, but
also harmless enough,

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:84%
but also opposing
some kind of curiosity

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and maybe opening the discussion
to why the military is still

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:90%
necessary in this world.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: On the
topic of UAPs, Tim,

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:84%
do you know anything about
tetrahedral-shaped craft?

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I'm not
an expert on crafts.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know much
about this technology

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:90%
besides from what I've seen.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I have seen some
pretty huge, darkish,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:84%
triangular craft
that hovered above me

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and disappeared
somewhere on my left.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Describe
how large these craft

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:90%
are when you say huge.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, I'd say that it's
probably about 20 meters maybe.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's not too easy to
say, because it lifted

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and it went over my head, and
then disappeared on my left.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:90%
So it's huge.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:20:01.200 align:middle line:84%
It has red lights in the rear,
and one roundish red light

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and three separate red
lights in every corner

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:90%
of this shaped craft.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The triangle, is
it like a pyramid shape

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.410 align:middle line:84%
or a triangular
flat-shaped craft?

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It is triangular, but
you have those triangles where

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:90%
all sides are equal in length.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And those we're talking of have
two longer sides and one side

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:37.110 align:middle line:90%
that is shorter, like that.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is the stargate
or portal technology

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
the dominant way ETs
travel through the universe

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:84%
when they have a solid
craft to navigate?

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I'd say it's the most
efficient and convenient way

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:84%
to travel, because it uses
the mechanics of the universe

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:84%
that you can appear
at some point,

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:84%
because every points are in
reality connected to only one

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So it makes a lot
of other technology

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.260 align:middle line:90%
and approaches less efficient.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
You can have different
technologies in order

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:84%
to travel from one
point to another,

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:84%
but that's just the most
elegant and easy way.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's been suggested
that the sun is an exit

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.200 align:middle line:84%
point of a wormhole, and that
black holes are the entry

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.740 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about that?

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: To my
understanding, light itself

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and the interconnectivity
of the universe

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation
to this technology.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But when communicating to Being
6, they said that the role of--

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that the sun and the moon
from their perspective,

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
they are functioning
as some kind of gates

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:84%
for the Earth in the middle
of it, because to them,

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:84%
the sun and the moon resemble
male and female energies

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.933 align:middle line:84%
while the Earth is the
child in the middle.

00:22:09.933 --> 00:22:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What type
of technologies

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:84%
have you seen in the
field of communications?

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Surely, I've seen the
communications from the Greys.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:84%
They are using this kind of
interconnected communication

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:84%
network that goes
all over the universe

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and even in dimensions and
frequencies that are totally

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.210 align:middle line:90%
exotic and different.

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if anyone knows
how those exotic realities have

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:90%
a connection to this reality.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I believe that an irrational,
non-existing logic

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.730 align:middle line:84%
might be a logic
that can be utilized

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:90%
in order to connect to them.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So the absence of a
logic might be the logic

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.660 align:middle line:90%
to connect to them.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:90%
That might be a thing.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The Greys are using this kind
of network, neuronal network,

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, in order to
communicate and to send

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:84%
big data through the
universe and in an instant.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
As far as I am concerned,
most of the species

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:84%
on this level of
reality, they seem

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:84%
to have a problem to
overcome very huge distances.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:37.380 align:middle line:84%
They use different signal and
wavelength patterns in order

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:84%
to communicate, which
have their limitations.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in Earth,
mainstream physics,

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.190 align:middle line:84%
pretty much everything
is radio wave-based,

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:84%
which means you have a
very short distance that

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:57.420 align:middle line:84%
can be utilized in order to
bring information from one

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:90%
point to another point.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And most species that I am
aware of pretty much struggle

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.930 align:middle line:90%
with distances still.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.020 align:middle line:84%
The Greys, though,
and some other pretty

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:84%
elevated and advanced
technologized beings

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and species, they even read
to different realities.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:84%
They can even-- and I know
this is something that has been

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:90%
researched on Earth as well--

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:84%
they can even reach dreams
and give information

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:84%
into dreams, or even into
totally exotic afterlife

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
scenarios or totally
exotic realities.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.880 align:middle line:84%
We're way beyond using
frequencies and wavelengths.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're at
a level of technology

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:57.970 align:middle line:84%
where the absence of
logic and rationalism

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:02.770 align:middle line:84%
is the rational and
logical approach in order

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:90%
to connect systems.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's very exotic, because
most species at Level 3 and 4

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:84%
consciousness are using some
kind of material or quantum

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.840 align:middle line:84%
physic approach in
order to bring data

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:25.420 align:middle line:84%
from one point to another while
some very elevated species are

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:32.350 align:middle line:84%
using the absence of information
in order to bring information

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.170 align:middle line:90%
to some point.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And also, some species are
using temporal dynamics

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:84%
in order to
communicate, which is

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:84%
kind of the step between
those ways to communicate,

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
which means using
the dimension of time

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:84%
in order to place an impulse
on time that goes in two ways.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
That makes calculation a
little bit more profound,

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:84%
because when you use
temporal dynamics in order

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.800 align:middle line:84%
to communicate
information, you always

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:84%
need to know that the
influences go in two directions.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.490 align:middle line:84%
It goes to the past
and the future.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's like placing
a stone into water

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:90%
and you see those ripples.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
They take that into
consideration and use

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.630 align:middle line:84%
that as a mechanism
to communicate.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, for
temporal technologies,

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
are we talking
about technologies

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.940 align:middle line:84%
that can activate time
traveling in both directions?

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Temporal
dynamics define time

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.330 align:middle line:84%
as an approachable
dimension, which

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:44.110 align:middle line:84%
means a dimension is something
that can be measured upon.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.220 align:middle line:90%
So we can put location to it.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
That means you can put location
into time as a dimension.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you imagine time as a
big lake that is two-dimensional

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:04.780 align:middle line:84%
or something, you just place
a bit and piece of impulse

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
into that, and at that
point it brings out

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:90%
some waves in two directions.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And the impulse is
just information

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
brought into a system so
you can bring information

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:90%
into a temporal dynamic.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So that way, some pretty
high and advanced species

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.370 align:middle line:84%
can use temporal
dynamics in order

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:31.300 align:middle line:84%
to utilize it as a
communication tool.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If it's a
communication tool,

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:36.580 align:middle line:84%
do you need a device to
receive it and translate it?

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Or does it somehow
download into your head?

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: No.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, time doesn't have a
geometrical form, just as

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.460 align:middle line:90%
matter has, for example.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Information from
one dimension needs

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:84%
to be restructured
so that it can

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.180 align:middle line:84%
appear upon a
different dimension

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.490 align:middle line:90%
in a different geometrical form.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:04.870 align:middle line:84%
One thing that could,
for example, be used

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:11.230 align:middle line:84%
is all those crop
circles or stones,

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:15.520 align:middle line:84%
or you could use a screen
or something in order

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
to use temporal dynamics to
bring information into a system

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.842 align:middle line:90%
without going there physically.

00:28:22.842 --> 00:28:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What will it
take for the planet

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:84%
to have access to and benefit
from these technologies?

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: To my knowledge,
a lot of technologies

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.360 align:middle line:84%
have been prepared
in the background

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:43.480 align:middle line:84%
or even given to humanity
in a trustful way in order

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.750 align:middle line:84%
to bring harmony to the
system and the planet.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the way the
system is ruled out

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and everything works
on this planet,

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:02.350 align:middle line:84%
there are some challenges
that come from that.

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that realizing
that bringing our technology

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.070 align:middle line:84%
is something that must be done
in order to mutually benefit

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:84%
from it, to sustain life
on this planet, that's

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.100 align:middle line:90%
the importance of it.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm pretty
optimistic that we have

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:31.070 align:middle line:84%
huge, wondrous, interesting
science and technology coming

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:90%
in the next one or two years.

>>EMERY: Do all ET

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: No, of course not.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Everyone might think that
people in the universe

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.440 align:middle line:90%
are super advanced.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:90%
They are not.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.830 align:middle line:84%
There are places that
are raw and there

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:84%
are places that are less
advanced than Earth.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:90%
So no.

>>TIM: Everyone agrees upon
the significance of the moon.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And quoting the Greys here, it's
the key to ascension of Earth.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:22.640 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of evidence
that UAPs enter the moon

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.990 align:middle line:90%
and leave the moon.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.240 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it myself.

Tim, what are the effects of
the moon on the people of Earth?

the natural evolution of Earth.
