00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:21.640 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.852 align:middle line:10%
we are with Randy Cramer.

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:24.310 align:middle line:10%
Randy shares with
us his experience

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.140 align:middle line:10%
in a secret space program.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:10%
Randy, welcome.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.898 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY CRAMER: Thanks.

00:00:27.898 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Randy, there's many
different clandestine programs

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
out there, both military,
corporate, and then you have,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:84%
of course, the SSP program
that you were involved with.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:84%
What's the differences
between all these entities

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:90%
and agencies?

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.630 align:middle line:10%
>>CRAMER: Well, over the decades
that we've been doing this,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:10%
you've had a number of programs
that have developed out

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:10%
of much earlier programs decades
ago from corporate programs,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720 align:middle line:10%
independent contractor,
reverse engineering programs,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.900 align:middle line:10%
the various military
intelligence agency programs.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, any one that
could acquire the information

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to develop the
technology has done so,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and who could somehow
acquire the funding to do so

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.760 align:middle line:90%
has done so.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have
the ability to say, hey,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
we have a stake in
this game, we have

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.430 align:middle line:84%
technology that gets
us a seat at the table,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.280 align:middle line:84%
then that gives
that organization,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
or that group of
military intelligence

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.930 align:middle line:84%
or corporate personnel to
participate in the larger

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's competitive
in that sense.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wants to develop
the best propulsion system.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wants to develop the
best directed energy weapon.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wants to develop
the best genetic augmentation

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
program, so that they
have some kind of edge

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:90%
over somebody else's program.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.983 align:middle line:84%
Mostly just to satisfy egos
or monetary compensation,

00:01:46.983 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:90%
to be honest with you.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a conglomeration
of every stakeholder, everyone

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
who has the ability to develop
that technology, to put it

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.340 align:middle line:90%
into the larger pool.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And also because,
you know, we've

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:90%
been doing this for decades.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't come to a point
where we've made the best

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:90%
spaceship or the best weapon.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's a constant
development process.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And engineers are constantly
developing in the direction

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:84%
that they feel is
the direction to go,

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
develop 20 or more

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:84%
different parallel programs so
that maybe in another 50 years,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:84%
we'll see what's the
best ship we can make.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
What's the best
weapon we can make.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
What's the best augmentation
that we can get.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of call it
the grand cluster fudge,

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
except we usually
don't say fudge.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just
really this mishmash

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
of so many different agencies
and so many different programs

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that have developed over
decades that, in some cases,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
loosely participate, and in
some cases are way more tight,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, as far as
allies or friends,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.940 align:middle line:84%
than other departments
or other agencies.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Some programs work very
reluctantly together.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all
sort of reluctantly

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.030 align:middle line:84%
work with the Schwabenlanders
because we have to.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And they sort of work with
us because they have to.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.243 align:middle line:84%
But it's not really because
either side likes it.

00:03:08.243 --> 00:03:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are the origins
of the covert military space

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:90%
program?

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Like, when did it
actually begin?

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, there could be
some debate or argument there,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:84%
depending on how far
you want to go back

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.630 align:middle line:84%
and what technology, you
know, has been sort of

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:90%
acquired that far back.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.880 align:middle line:84%
But I would say our
main starting point

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:90%
is really about World War II.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.690 align:middle line:84%
If you want to say that
our own space program is

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:84%
our own ships, our own
personnel, our own equipment,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:90%
that was--

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I would say the research
and development process

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:90%
of that began in the '40s.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But I would say
by the mid 1950s,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.930 align:middle line:84%
we had our first
sort of few vehicles

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.410 align:middle line:84%
that we could patrol
around in, our own pilots.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
the fledgling stages

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:84%
of the covert military space
program, would be, you know,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:90%
'40s and '50s.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.037 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where are they
getting their funding from?

00:04:02.037 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, a
combination of places.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest that there's a
certain amount of funding that

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:84%
comes from the banking industry,
the global banking system.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.650 align:middle line:84%
There are some
private investors,

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about some of
the very wealthiest families

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:90%
on the planet who are investing.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:84%
But you also have military
intelligence and rogue agencies

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:84%
who were pulling money out
of the black budget, out

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
of, let's say, black market
heroin, cocaine, and maybe

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:84%
other drug manufacturing
production.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of different
places that it's coming from.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Not all of it legal, some of
it more nefarious than others.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a trillion
or something missing a year

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:90%
from the general budget.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't even include
what we're talking about,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.310 align:middle line:90%
the black budget.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So they're
funneling money off of that.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.297 align:middle line:84%
They're pulling money
out of the black budget.

00:04:53.297 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:84%
They're pulling money out of
drug trafficking programs,

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
plus private investment,
plus the banking industry,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
plus what is now an
intergalactic trade business,

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
where we're manufacturing things
and selling them off-world.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're conducting
business off-world

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
that is also generating
large quantities of money,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:84%
which then is often
being reinvested back

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:90%
into the program.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding
is, we're not

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.180 align:middle line:84%
talking about trillions
of dollars a year.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.950 align:middle line:84%
We're talking in
the quadrillions.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.325 align:middle line:84%
What type of trading is going on
up there in the stars with us,

00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that you're aware--
is it mining?

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Is it people?

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's a little
bit of everything.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
My understanding though, our
top three intergalactic exports

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:90%
are military technology.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Number two is beer.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And number three is
children's clothing.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Which I would suggest is not
going for children, but maybe

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.860 align:middle line:90%
child-sized people.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Child-sized
people meaning

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial origin?

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials who are,
you know, between 3 and 5 feet

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.910 align:middle line:90%
tall.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you
seen one of these?

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's talk
about the structure--

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:84%
like, who is actually
running the planet right now,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:90%
and these agencies?

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Who's that one
percenter, you know?

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I would suggest, based
on the way I understand it,

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:84%
let's just say there's
a metaphorical table.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And that at that table, everyone
who's got skin in the game

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:90%
gets a chair at that table.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And at that table, there's
a lot of discussion, a lot

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
of maneuvering, deal-making,
so that people can

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:90%
get what they want out of it.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But that no real one
person at that table

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
has the authority to
dictate to everyone else.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone else
has a monkey wrench

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that they could throw into
the works if they wanted to.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, it's
a big Mexican standoff

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.160 align:middle line:84%
where everyone says, well,
if I don't get this, then,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:84%
uh, you know, this might
happen, and you know, to ba--

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.367 align:middle line:84%
You know, like, uh, nice
business you have here.

00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
It'd be a shame if
something happened to it,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.242 align:middle line:84%
it caught on fire, right,
or something like that.

00:07:06.242 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's a little competitive.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But in the same way, it
balances out that way.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So think of it as
a lot of people

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:84%
competing, but because no one
person or agency can control

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing, at some
point still everyone

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
has to cooperate at the end of
the day towards a common goal.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So while there may be a lot
of differences, arguments,

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
disagreements, the
basic questions

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:84%
about planetary solar
system security,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
development, technological
development, you know,

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.390 align:middle line:84%
intergalactic trade, those
things are all agreed upon.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And they all find a way to
cooperate so that, you know,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.930 align:middle line:84%
all the people who are
sitting at that table

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.450 align:middle line:84%
continue to develop the
technology they want

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.157 align:middle line:84%
and make the trillions of
dollars a year that they want.

00:07:51.157 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you're saying
there is a lot of ego going on

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:90%
with these megalomaniacs.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, they
have to work together,

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
because each one of them
has dirt on each other.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.525 align:middle line:84%
My brigadier has said that
the worst thing that they have

00:08:02.525 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:84%
to deal with in
these meetings is

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.965 align:middle line:84%
what he calls the CEO
mentality, which is, you know,

00:08:07.965 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it my way.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what you all think.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't get
mine, screw you guys.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:90%
And so, it's-- yeah.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of egos to deal with.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And my brigadier says, it's
like a lot of screaming babies

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:90%
at the table.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you just
gotta hand them a sucker

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.185 align:middle line:84%
and then, you
know, they shut up.

00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:27.272 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Can we break down--

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:84%
let's look at this
table more definitively.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And let's break it down
to each person there,

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, really, agency, or
organization, corporation.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:84%
How many do you actually think
are part of that round table

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and, let's get into each one,
or the ones that you know about,

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle line:90%
that we can talk about.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Wow.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would say the
total participants in groups

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and agencies is easily
in the hundreds.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, we could be
approaching 1,000 or more

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:90%
different groups or agencies.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we are talking about not
just in the continental United

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about globally.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about most
of the G20 countries

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:84%
participate in these programs
in one way or another.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's a lot of
agencies, and a lot

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:84%
of military organizations,
a lot of rogue agencies,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of corporate agencies,
a lot of private money,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:84%
a lot of banking money, from
a lot of different countries.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And that makes a
lot of small groups

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:90%
that make up the larger whole.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: At this roundtable,
are there any non-humans?

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The majority, which
would be more than 90%, 95%,

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:90%
are terrestrial humans.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.760 align:middle line:84%
There are a few
non-terrestrial personnel

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.240 align:middle line:84%
that we have come to
trust enough to include

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:90%
in that process.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:84%
But again, probably easily
95% of the personnel

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:84%
are terrestrial-born
human persons.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.588 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they human-like, or
do you know where they're from?

00:09:58.588 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Um.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:90%
The species that we're working--

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that would be at that
table at the moment,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I would say are
predominantly the type that

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:84%
look very much like you and
I. Walking down the street,

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
you might not be able
to tell the difference.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And that comes to something
very basic, which is,

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:84%
we tend to trust
other species who

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
look more like us
than we tend to trust

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.960 align:middle line:90%
species who don't look like us.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're tending to
develop stronger alliances

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and friendships with
other humanoid species

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:90%
that are very similar to us.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.005 align:middle line:84%
And we just tend to be a little
less trusting of other species

00:10:33.005 --> 00:10:34.630 align:middle line:84%
if we don't feel like
we can understand

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:84%
where they're coming from, or
what their true motives might

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:90%
be.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:90%
Mostly humans.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Tiny percentage, maybe, of
extraterrestrial personnel

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
who, again, look
mostly like you and us.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why are
these non-humans

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.165 align:middle line:90%
sitting at this roundtable?

00:10:48.165 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, everyone
sitting at the table

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:90%
has a stake or an interest.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, I would say
these extraterrestrials are

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:84%
there because they understand
that their interest is

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:84%
to attempt to help us
get through this process

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
without making any
terrible, horrible mistakes.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as an upperclassman
coming into a lower class

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:90%
to help out.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
They're not necessarily
there because they're

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
trying to make a bunch of money,
or a bunch of profit, or even

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.740 align:middle line:90%
control things.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Moreso to just be a
more experienced being,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:84%
person in that scenario that
can help understand the process

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and help us understand the
process to make it more smooth

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and, hopefully, where we
make less fatal mistakes.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're just
there to kind of look over

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.128 align:middle line:84%
our shoulders, and
to probably see

00:11:39.128 --> 00:11:40.920 align:middle line:84%
what's going on, make
sure we're not making

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:90%
any really drastic mistakes.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.903 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a little
experience with this,

00:11:45.903 --> 00:11:47.820 align:middle line:84%
working on the projects
with extraterrestrials

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.897 align:middle line:90%
that look like us.

00:11:48.897 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they were doing.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
They were really just
kind of monitoring us

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and help educate us on
things that we just were not

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.583 align:middle line:90%
aware of, scientifically.

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I guess I'd
like to make this point.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Most of those species
understand that if we

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:84%
engage in an unfettered
military development,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.270 align:middle line:84%
we could become a
greater threat at large

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.420 align:middle line:84%
by becoming more and
more militaristic as we

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:84%
go into space, as opposed to
taking our military strength

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
as we go into space
and tempering it more

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:90%
with discipline and wisdom.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what the
successful species do,

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.390 align:middle line:84%
who don't become, you
know, dictatorial,

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:90%
dominating aggressors.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think those species
understand that they're not

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:90%
just helping us.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.980 align:middle line:84%
They are also trying
to protect and defend

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the
universe at large

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
from what we could become
if we're not guided

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:90%
in a more positive direction.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.450 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.908 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Getting
back to the table,

00:12:46.908 --> 00:12:49.170 align:middle line:84%
we've mentioned
extraterrestrials there.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.630 align:middle line:90%
We mentioned some corporations.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else
you'd like to add?

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I guess, to try
and be more specific, I mean,

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
there are Naval Space
Command personnel.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, United States
Marine Corps Special Section

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:84%
personnel, Air Force
Space Command personnel,

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Army Space Command personnel,
CIA Space Command personnel,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:90%
NSA Space Command personnel.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every agency that
has its own technology

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
is essentially having
some senior administrators

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.720 align:middle line:84%
or officers who are given
the intelligence briefings so

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:84%
that they can make the decisions
and then participate and sit

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.420 align:middle line:90%
at that table.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who is a high level
administrator or officer in any

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.053 align:middle line:84%
of those organizations
is very likely

00:13:33.053 --> 00:13:34.470 align:middle line:84%
to be having a
seat at that table.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Again, not just in the US, but
in all the other G20 countries

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:90%
that participate.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where are
these meetings held?

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, my
brigadier actually

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
participates in these meetings
on a very regular basis.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me that he spends
a lot of his time going back

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and forth between New York,
Washington DC, Belgium,

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Hong Kong, London, Berlin,
Tokyo, Beijing, and Moscow.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of places where
that these are participating.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And mostly centers of military
intelligence, financial,

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:90%
government around the world.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Those are the places that
I know he goes around to.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware
of anyone at this table

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that is using technology
far more advanced

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:84%
than we have right now,
for their own personal use?

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Ooh.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest that
that happens a lot.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:84%
That anytime you
have someone who

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:84%
is in control of an agency that
has access to that technology,

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and access to that equipment, if
it's within their possibility,

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why not have
your own space ship?

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Why not have your own crew,
you know, off the books,

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:84%
off to the side, in case
you have an emergency

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and you need to get
the hell out of here?

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:90%
So I would say that, yeah.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:90%
That probably happens a lot.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.152 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think it
happens to a level

00:14:57.152 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:90%
where it becomes threatening.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.777 align:middle line:84%
I think most of
where that happens

00:14:59.777 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:84%
is self-interest,
protection, where people

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.330 align:middle line:84%
are thinking, well,
if this all goes crazy

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.150 align:middle line:84%
and the world, you know,
ends up in a major invasion

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.770 align:middle line:84%
or going to blow
up, I want to be

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:84%
able to get my family
and my friends to safety.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So why not have some of their
own equipment, their own ship

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.810 align:middle line:90%
and their own crew.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you name, by
name, a few of the corporations

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.260 align:middle line:84%
that are possibly part
of this roundtable?

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I mean,
Northrop Grumman makes the TR3B.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So as an aerospace
contractor, they're

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.580 align:middle line:90%
definitely at the table.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Boeing makes a lot of the
components for the spacecraft.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.017 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily make
a lot of the entire craft.

00:15:37.017 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
But they make a lot
of the components,

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the internal
parts, cabinetry, seating.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Like internal parts that
you would build the ship to.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So they're-- you know, all
the companies, at some point,

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:90%
have--

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.870 align:middle line:84%
especially the aerospace
industry companies--

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Are building
something that they're

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:90%
contributing to the whole.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I do know a guy who actually
worked as a contractor

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.650 align:middle line:84%
in a B2 factory,
where they were making

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:90%
components for the wings.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:84%
But he also described,
he said, look.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we knew we were making
panels that didn't go on a B2,

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:90%
But they don't tell you that.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:84%
They're just like, hey, we
need more of these panels.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, these
don't go on a B2.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Why are we making these?

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So in some cases,
these programs are

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.740 align:middle line:84%
making spacecraft
technology and parts

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
under the umbrella of other
aircraft, or covert, you know,

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
experimental aircraft programs,
or military aircraft programs.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So definitely the military
aerospace contractors.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:90%
They're in there for sure.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:45.190 align:middle line:84%
As well as like General
Electric, and some of the tech

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:90%
companies who, because--

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
who writes all the
software for everything?

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Who's got all the code
monkeys working for them?

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you got to go
to the people who know

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:90%
how to do that job the best.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.870 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got even
the independent contracting

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.795 align:middle line:90%
companies like SpaceX.

00:17:02.795 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Someone asked me one time,
why are these guys still using

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:05.970 align:middle line:90%
rocket technology?

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.315 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, for their
civilian space program,

00:17:09.315 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:84%
you better believe they're
using rocket technology.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the limitation
that they're being given.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't think
that these contractors,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
independent
contractors, are also

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
developing military technology
to sell to the military

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
quietly, then you're not
understanding the big picture.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we may see
the rockets, you know,

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:90%
that Elon Musk is building.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.910 align:middle line:84%
We're not seeing the
other stuff that he's

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:84%
building for the military
as a private contractor.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.720 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or we don't see
what's going into that rocket,

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:90%
by the way--

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.412 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because
he's now-- you know,

00:17:43.412 --> 00:17:47.360 align:middle line:84%
has a lot going on of
moving military to space,

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:90%
which is kept a secret.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And people are always
asking me, well,

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
how do the people loading
this thing in the rocket,

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:90%
you know, not see what it is?

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:90%
You don't see.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It's in a capsule.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.520 align:middle line:84%
It's an encapsulated
compartment.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:90%
It's in a box, or a tube.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't see
what's going in that thing.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Would you also say--

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
because of experience with
McDonnell Douglas and Raytheon

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and Northrop Grumman, these
people, and these corporations,

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed share
their technology

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.175 align:middle line:90%
with other countries.

00:18:17.175 --> 00:18:17.975 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:18:17.975 --> 00:18:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So even though they
make the F15 Eagle here,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:90%
we also sell it to Israel.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So is this happening
also, clandestinely,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
with like, a TR3 and these
other, you know, craft,

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:90%
that we don't get to see?

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.150 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of that has
to do with classification

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:37.570 align:middle line:90%
and clearances.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would also
suggest that, you know,

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:84%
if we're selling
F15s to someone,

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.430 align:middle line:84%
we're not selling them
the best of our equipment.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.450 align:middle line:84%
We're selling them F15s, but
we've got better than F15s.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So we may be selling,
you know, TR3Bs

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.788 align:middle line:84%
that are designs that
are decades-old to some

00:18:54.788 --> 00:18:56.830 align:middle line:84%
of these countries, while
the ones we're building

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:84%
are much fresher, newer
and shinier-looking.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.162 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:19:00.162 --> 00:19:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're
sharing that technology

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.960 align:middle line:84%
with other countries, we're not
sharing the latest, bestest,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.173 align:middle line:90%
newest technology with them.

00:19:07.173 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:84%
We're sharing the
older technology

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:84%
with them, which
is still advanced,

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:90%
but it's not the newest we got.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like the iPhone.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.310 align:middle line:90%
There's already an iPhone 25.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's just
sitting on the shelf.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:84%
They don't want give
it to us all at once.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they do the same
thing, is what you're saying.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:84%
They want to milk every dollar
they can from each component,

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are the
corporate space agencies

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:84%
different than the
military agencies?

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Very.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.740 align:middle line:84%
To be honest, I have to
speak very honestly here.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not an area that
I'm super familiar with.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
But I do know a
few people who have

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.530 align:middle line:90%
served in those departments.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:84%
The best way that I can
describe it as my understanding

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:90%
is, profit-oriented.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:51.095 align:middle line:84%
Ethics, you know, kind
of off to the side.

00:19:51.095 --> 00:19:53.312 align:middle line:84%
So the corporate
programs are kind

00:19:53.312 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:90%
of what you'd think they are.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:90%
They're there to make a profit.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And they don't necessarily
care how they do it.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do the corporate space
agencies and military space

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.400 align:middle line:84%
agencies ever come into
conflict with each other?

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I can
recall an incident.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So in my teens,
before my deployment,

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I was being deployed with
terrestrial special forces

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:84%
units as part of my
training process.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
event when we were--

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
let's just say somewhere
in South America,

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:90%
without me being too specific.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And a extraterrestrial
vehicle crashed

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.040 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the jungle.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And we were immediately
told to head for the site

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:90%
and secure the site.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So we got there first,
secured the site.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But then two other,
you know, black camo,

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:84%
you know, special forces
units showed up and were like,

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.482 align:middle line:84%
yeah, well, we were
ordered to secure the site.

00:20:45.482 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, yeah,
well, we've got the site.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, OK.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Backed off a few hundred
yards, and then opened fire.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And we basically had
a firefight over who

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:90%
got to get the spaceship.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:10%
So.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:90%
That technology is invaluable.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And so the forces on
the ground were just

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:84%
told to start
shooting at each other

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
in order to see who could
secure the piece of equipment.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does this
happen regularly?

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I can
only remember personally

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.510 align:middle line:90%
the one incident.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest, if
it happened that time,

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:90%
it happens other times.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.988 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was an anomaly,
based on the way it went down.

00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I would think they'd
be a little bit more civilized.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:84%
But I do understand
the competition factor

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.990 align:middle line:84%
that's out there, as far
as reverse engineering

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.797 align:middle line:90%
the technology.

00:21:29.797 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:90%
And they will kill for it.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.505 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well,
interestingly enough, I

00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:84%
think everyone in this situation
actually was very civilized.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.857 align:middle line:84%
When we all sort
of were standing

00:21:36.857 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:84%
there talking to one
another, everyone

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
was very polite and
communicating politely

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.350 align:middle line:90%
to one another.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And when everyone
started to back off,

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:84%
the Sergeant Major that
was with us was like, OK.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Take some cover and get ready.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Like, he knew pretty much
what was going to happen.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.020 align:middle line:84%
But everyone was
polite about it.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But you know, they had their
orders to secure the site.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:84%
We had our orders
to secure the site.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And that just became a conflict
of interest at that point,

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.800 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, forces on
the ground do what they do,

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:84%
which is start
shooting at each other.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
The audience needs to know,
being in the military, when

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:84%
you get an order, even though
you might not agree with it,

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.815 align:middle line:84%
you know, you follow out the
order to its completeness.

00:22:15.815 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Even if,
you know, it happens

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:84%
to be another team
that you actually know.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And so if this is
happening somewhere

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.730 align:middle line:84%
on some planet, a shootout,
or even on this planet,

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.090 align:middle line:84%
over a craft, I know
that these agencies that

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.880 align:middle line:90%
are shooting each other--

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:90%
you know, they have a boss.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.083 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And those people at
the table, what's happening

00:22:37.083 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:90%
at that table at that point?

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.520 align:middle line:90%
Or after the fight?

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I imagine that's when there's
finger pointing and shouting,

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and you know, then people start
dealmaking, and, oh, yeah,

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:90%
sorry about that.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Here's something to
compensate you for that.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know, again.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:90%
I've seen this.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: At some
point, they end up

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:84%
working out a deal that
they all can live with.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.970 align:middle line:84%
I've seen them make exchanges
for the loss of many people.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And they don't blink
an eye over it.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.165 align:middle line:84%
It's just part of doing
business, to be honest.

00:23:08.165 --> 00:23:08.965 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yep.

00:23:08.965 --> 00:23:09.765 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:09.765 --> 00:23:10.655 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:12.780 align:middle line:84%
It's all numbers on a
spreadsheet to them, I think.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.070 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What force at the
table actually dominates,

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:90%
pretty much?

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there's
like a percentage.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it's like 10% actually
control the 90% at the table,

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.670 align:middle line:84%
because they have a
little bit more firepower,

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit
more knowledge, also.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Definitely the United
States dominates.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:90%
A good way to think of it is--

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess, basically
looking at the corporate model,

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.390 align:middle line:84%
think of this table as
a board of directors,

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:90%
where everyone is a shareholder.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And not everyone has the
same amount of shares.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.790 align:middle line:84%
So one person or agency
may have more shares

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:90%
than another person.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But no one has enough shares
to tell everyone what to do.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there's still
the sort of competitive,

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:90%
you know, agreeing.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:84%
But the US definitely has
more shares at the table.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How far
do they actually

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:11.853 align:middle line:84%
go into the universe, these
corporations, are you aware of?

00:24:11.853 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, certainly
my understanding is,

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:84%
we have taken some
pretty lengthy distances

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.620 align:middle line:90%
throughout our own galaxy.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And without, again, it
being really my area,

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I am also to understand
that we are exploring

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.410 align:middle line:90%
beyond our own galaxy.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.530 align:middle line:90%
So we've been to other places.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest from what I know
that any individual agency is

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:84%
going to go as far as they
seem to think that it is safe,

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.910 align:middle line:90%
or risk-worthy for them to go.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And as long as there is a profit
motive, or a profit margin

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:84%
that they can look at, they'll
look at that risk reward

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:84%
sort of equation and go
as far as they think they

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:90%
can continue to make profits.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is the covert
military space program, Randy?

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, every military
agency that has programs

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.550 align:middle line:84%
definitely cooperates
together in a way,

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
because they understand that
they have a common ideology

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.350 align:middle line:84%
in a way that, let's say, the
corporate personnel don't.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Corporate personnel are, do what
you gotta do for profit motive.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Military personnel are
a little bit more to,

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:84%
we will sacrifice what
we have to sacrifice

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:25.200 align:middle line:84%
for the common good within
some boundary of morals, ethics

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:90%
and standards.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Because without that,
they're just corporatists.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So military tradition
that goes back centuries

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:38.220 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with honor,
integrity, following the rules,

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:90%
setting a better example.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So these are things
that continue

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to pervade military
agencies around the world.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, military agencies
find that common ground.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's much easier for them
to therefore come together

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:84%
under this umbrella of
covert military space program

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:55.670 align:middle line:90%
activities.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad there
is a balance there.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.750 align:middle line:84%
I think the military helps
balance these corporations

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.430 align:middle line:90%
to an extent, like you said.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No question.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, without them
we'd be in deep doo doo,

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.602 align:middle line:90%
again, to use PG language.

00:26:09.602 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.760 align:middle line:84%
What are your insights
to their agenda?

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The covert
military space program?

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Pretty simple and
straightforward.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Planetary solar system defense.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And the survival
and continuation

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:84%
of civilization on planet Earth
is their number one priority.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.870 align:middle line:84%
The probably number
two priority for that

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:35.730 align:middle line:84%
is going to be exploration,
colonies, and protecting trade.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Because trade is the lifeblood
of our intergalactic solar

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.960 align:middle line:90%
system terrestrial economy.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And the military definitely
wants to protect that for sure.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, they would
like to keep order, keep

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
the planet safe, keep us
from destroying ourselves,

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and keep anybody
else from, you know,

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:84%
invading or not being able
to put us in a position

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.500 align:middle line:84%
where we can't decide
our own fate and destiny.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there an
extraterrestrial invasion,

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:84%
or a threat that you've
heard of, in the projects?

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, something that
changes constantly over time.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to talk about
what the major threats

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
were 20 years ago,

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.960 align:middle line:84%
they're not the same
that they are now.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.400 align:middle line:84%
If we were to consider what
the potentials for invasion,

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and or, let's say,
hoax invasion,

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:90%
that's changed over time.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:36.720 align:middle line:84%
The actual plan on paper for
how a hoax invasion might look

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.700 align:middle line:90%
has changed over time.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest
that at some point,

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:50.220 align:middle line:84%
there has to be a major
shift in the way these two

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:90%
separate worlds exist.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:55.170 align:middle line:84%
We have this sort of
normal civilian world

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.920 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth that most people
that we walk down the street

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.950 align:middle line:90%
and meet every day--

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.360 align:middle line:90%
that's their reality.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this advanced
military extraterrestrial

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.230 align:middle line:84%
super-technology program that
has this kind of other reality.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
referred to that

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:90%
as a breakaway civilization.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I would kind of just really
call that a separation

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:84%
of the civilization
that we have,

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:84%
which kind of understands
now that they're

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.710 align:middle line:84%
more dependent they are
on one another than they

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:84%
can be independent
of one another.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So the realization is
that at some point,

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.220 align:middle line:84%
these two worlds have
to come together.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's more than
likely that in order

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.880 align:middle line:84%
to engage that
bringing it together,

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:84%
it's going to have to happen in
a way in which is undeniable,

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:84%
forced, to be honest
with you, because there

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.760 align:middle line:84%
is some resistance that's
not going to like it.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And some people are just
going to have to live with it.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:90%
And all sort of encompassing.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that
whatever event we

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.240 align:middle line:84%
might be looking at
in the future for us

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.880 align:middle line:84%
to transition into
a pre-disclosure

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.430 align:middle line:84%
to a post-disclosure
environment,

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:10.494 align:middle line:84%
probably will involve some
sort of invasion scenario.

00:29:10.494 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Um.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.640 align:middle line:84%
There are things I could say
more about that that I probably

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.450 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't say more about that.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:22.600 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest that
big change is on its way.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just looking
at the history

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.960 align:middle line:84%
of how we've come closer
and closer and closer

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.460 align:middle line:90%
to a disclosure moment.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's looking at
what's happening around us

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.960 align:middle line:84%
would have to say that we're
getting closer and closer.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.385 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest that
as we get closer and closer

00:29:37.385 --> 00:29:38.760 align:middle line:84%
to something that's
an inevitable

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.610 align:middle line:84%
moment, wherever and whatever
that is, that we're just

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:90%
continuing to close that gap.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that gap is
pretty small right now.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have far
between now and that point.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this why the United
States Space Force was maybe

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.357 align:middle line:90%
put in place?

00:29:54.357 --> 00:29:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, the
Space Force is certainly

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.140 align:middle line:90%
a front organization.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
something brand new

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:02.660 align:middle line:90%
that's never been there before.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly
gives us an open door

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.060 align:middle line:90%
to get a foot through.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And without going into the
complexities of how that's

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.710 align:middle line:84%
ironing itself out,
because how it was proposed

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.590 align:middle line:84%
isn't necessarily
how it's working out.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.750 align:middle line:90%
So let me put it this way.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Space Force was proposed.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And there is a process between
Air Force Space Command,

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:28.110 align:middle line:84%
US Space Command, which
is a command agency which

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.050 align:middle line:84%
covers all of the space program
agencies, which I have said

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:84%
to people before-- you
don't have a US Space

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Command unless you
have deployable forces.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, to
have an organization

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.000 align:middle line:84%
like US Space Command, which
tells the other programs

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.498 align:middle line:84%
and commands what to do,
means that there's probably

00:30:44.498 --> 00:30:45.540 align:middle line:90%
something going on there.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So Space Force was
proposed, but at the moment,

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:52.290 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be some
attempt to declaw it,

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and make the director
not have the power

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.033 align:middle line:84%
that it was proposed for
the director to have.

00:30:59.033 --> 00:31:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
talk about having

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.520 align:middle line:84%
the director of Air
Force Space Command

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.980 align:middle line:84%
move in and take
over Space Force.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.573 align:middle line:84%
So there's some contention
in that process right now.

00:31:07.573 --> 00:31:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Who knows how it's
actually going to work out.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest that
the main purpose of that

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:84%
was, again, to just get the
ball a little farther down

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:84%
the field, maybe give us
a crack open in the door

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:84%
so that we can say, oh, look
what Space Force developed.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And look at this new
aircraft that we just made,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:84%
even if it's something
that we made 30 years ago.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.220 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.482 align:middle line:84%
That's the other thing I wanted
to let the audience know too.

00:31:32.482 --> 00:31:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can
verify this for me.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.863 align:middle line:84%
Is that the Space Force has
already been there, forever.

00:31:37.863 --> 00:31:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: For decades, yeah.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And now, I think it
is something where

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:45.060 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to, you know,
let people, like, break them

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:90%
in slowly.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The civilian world.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: To say, OK, we are
going amongst the stars.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.820 align:middle line:84%
We are bringing our
military up there.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.460 align:middle line:90%
And that was my next question.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of
went a little bit

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:01.560 align:middle line:84%
around that is, where's
it going to fall under?

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to be, you know,
the Air Force, or the Army,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.350 align:middle line:84%
or another corporate
entity, which it can't be.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because
it's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's all being ironed out.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:17.040 align:middle line:84%
The last report that I read
on that that was published

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.860 align:middle line:84%
in the media was outlining
sort of the struggle

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:90%
and what's happening with there.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would just say that
it's being ironed out.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know what the end
result of that is going to be,

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:90%
But, oh yeah.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.790 align:middle line:84%
We've had a Space
Force for decades.

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you
think that this force

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:39.540 align:middle line:84%
was put there also to protect
us from malevolent ETs?

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well,
certainly, the goal

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.650 align:middle line:84%
is to protect us from
anything that can harm us.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that as we
have developed that technology,

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and have grown
stronger, it gives us

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:54.510 align:middle line:84%
the ability to tell certain
species, you can leave now.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't want
to leave voluntarily,

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:57.960 align:middle line:90%
we'll escort you out.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't want
to be escorted out,

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.190 align:middle line:84%
then we'll evaporate
you and blow you

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.580 align:middle line:84%
off the surface of whatever
moon you may be sitting on

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.380 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So as we get stronger,
we have the ability

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.380 align:middle line:84%
to be self-determined
and decide who and what

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.080 align:middle line:90%
we want to be in our domain.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And that gives us the ability
to sort of tell which forces we

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:17.490 align:middle line:90%
want to have shuffle along.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Because certain
extraterrestrial species

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.650 align:middle line:84%
who've been manipulating
in the process

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:25.230 align:middle line:84%
only have the ability
to do so to the point

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:28.127 align:middle line:84%
that they have the strength
or technology to do so.

00:33:28.127 --> 00:33:30.210 align:middle line:84%
The minute that we have
the strength of technology

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.690 align:middle line:84%
to tell them no is the
moment that that negotiation

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.338 align:middle line:90%
can completely change.

00:33:36.338 --> 00:33:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, they are coming
here and visiting and shutting

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.040 align:middle line:90%
down our nuke sites.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.215 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it
looks like they're

00:33:44.215 --> 00:33:45.570 align:middle line:90%
looking out for us in a way.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Some certainly are.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think a
really good point

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.380 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
extraterrestrial community is

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.960 align:middle line:84%
there's no such thing as a
good alien or a bad alien.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:90%
No such thing.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.340 align:middle line:90%
There are good individuals.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:03.495 align:middle line:84%
There are bad individuals, if
you want to be binary about it.

00:34:03.495 --> 00:34:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We could also say
there are those

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.180 align:middle line:84%
who are more interested
in self-interest,

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.360 align:middle line:84%
those who are more interested
in helping everybody.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So even from species to
species, we don't necessarily

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
have everyone's our friend,
everyone's our enemy.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.460 align:middle line:84%
It's very muddled, to
be honest with you.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So I think just as the
process continues to develop,

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:27.250 align:middle line:84%
our goal is to push
everyone out of the yard

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:31.000 align:middle line:84%
that we think is a problem,
and hopefully keep people

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.639 align:middle line:84%
in the backyard
barbecue who you know,

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.108 align:middle line:84%
aren't going to
burn the house down,

00:34:36.108 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:84%
to use some metaphor that
just came out of my head.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We have all
these spacecraft.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.810 align:middle line:90%
We have special satellites.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:84%
We have special types of
missiles and rockets in space.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:51.969 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't these
average astronomers

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:53.360 align:middle line:90%
out there picking this up.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.739 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we see this?

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:55.989 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Two answers to that.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.480 align:middle line:84%
One, they are, when
they're looking.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time people,
just don't look up.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out when people
do look up, they see things.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.590 align:middle line:84%
But the reason they
don't see everything

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.900 align:middle line:84%
is we have developed pretty
sophisticated cloaking

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.130 align:middle line:90%
technology at this point.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:12.122 align:middle line:84%
So most of the military and
corporate craft are cloaked.

00:35:12.122 --> 00:35:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And so you're just
not going to see them.

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:16.200 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
invisible in the sky.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:90%


00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:90%
You can see them with infrared.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.040 align:middle line:84%
I do know some people that are
using infrared cameras, hooking

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.960 align:middle line:84%
up infrared cameras
to their telescopes.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing a lot
more with infrared

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:27.840 align:middle line:84%
than you're seeing
with the naked eye.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.632 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a lot
harder to hide that heat

00:35:29.632 --> 00:35:32.710 align:middle line:84%
signature than it is to hide
that visible light spectrum.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:37.230 align:middle line:84%
I noticed we use a lot of
thermal and infrared goggles

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and telescopes when we go
out on our expeditions,

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.550 align:middle line:90%
looking at the sky.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And there could be a craft right
there, 100 feet off the ground.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.460 align:middle line:90%
You would not see it.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.790 align:middle line:84%
With these special
light spectrums

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:54.520 align:middle line:84%
that give us more to see,
it's like right there.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.150 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a good idea
for the audience to get out

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:58.380 align:middle line:90%
there and start looking up.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Just about everything
gives off heat.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.555 align:middle line:84%
So even if it's not visible
within visible light,

00:36:03.555 --> 00:36:05.430 align:middle line:84%
you're very likely to
still be able to detect

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.055 align:middle line:84%
the infrared signature,
because there's

00:36:07.055 --> 00:36:09.990 align:middle line:84%
going to be some heat
differential between the object

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:12.300 align:middle line:90%
and the surrounding temperature.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And one
of the things with

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:20.820 align:middle line:84%
electrogravitic technology,
that really doesn't give off

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.720 align:middle line:84%
too much of any type of
heat signature or anything

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.810 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:29.760 align:middle line:84%
However, I have seen
anti-gravitic craft

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.393 align:middle line:84%
that were actually colder
than the surrounding area.

00:36:33.393 --> 00:36:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Hm.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.400 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I could see how that
could happen, sure.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly,
these vehicles

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.750 align:middle line:84%
are using different types
of generators, engines.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them are generating
large amounts of heat.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But most of them, you know, have
an internal cabin temperature.

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.660 align:middle line:84%
But then again,
some life forms may

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.470 align:middle line:84%
prefer the cabin temperature
lower than maybe we do.

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:57.330 align:middle line:90%
We like 70 degrees.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some other species
like it way cooler.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Randy, thanks
for coming on the show.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:03.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm Emery Smith.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
