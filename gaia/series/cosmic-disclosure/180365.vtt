[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:19.659 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY WEIDNER: All right.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle line:10%
Let's go back to our chronology.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.480 align:middle line:10%
Last time we visited, you
were telling us about--

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:10%
they had made you sign a
whole lot of documents,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:10%
and then you joined
something called IDARF.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.180 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON RICE: The Interplanetary
Defense and Reaction Forces

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:10%
were a unit that was border
patrol used for assistance

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.480 align:middle line:10%
on other planets.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
However, there were a number of
training exercises and training

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
periods that we
spent here on Earth.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Later in my
deployment, I found out

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.520 align:middle line:84%
a lot more information about the
history of the space program--

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:90%
this one in particular.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.284 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And where did
you find this out?

00:00:59.284 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, it was while I was
stationed on the second planet

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:90%
during my second deployment.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And we'll call him
Yohan, a friend of mine

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:90%
that was also an officer--

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:90%
German descent.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:90%
He was a Mars German.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them
were arrogant jerks.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Just like our
population here, you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:84%
have a mixture of good
people, nice people,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:84%
not so nice people, so same
thing with the Mars Germans.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking, they
had an arrogant streak

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that would put any politician,
actor, or professional athlete

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:90%
to shame.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And part of that was because
they were genetically modified.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
They did have usually stronger,
faster, higher reflexes, higher

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:90%
IQ.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wait a minute.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that the
German people are some kind

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:90%
of genetic experiment?

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The Mars
German civilization--

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.660 align:middle line:84%
they have been tinkering
with their genetics

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.349 align:middle line:90%
since they went independent.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:84%
During the deployment,
we never would

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.740 align:middle line:84%
have talked about any
of this around or near

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.130 align:middle line:84%
any senior officer as
well as around any chances

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:90%
of being recorded.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So it was really--
you weren't supposed

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
to be talking about what the
history of this whole thing

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:90%
was?

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, you must
have been really curious.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Of course I was.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Everybody must
have been really curious

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:90%
how this all happened.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody
is speaking German,

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and we defeated them
in World War II.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And why are we taking
orders from Germans?

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.933 align:middle line:10%
Why are all of our
commanding officers

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:10%
have German descent
or German accent?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're already
just curious as hell

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:90%
when you met Yohan.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And during the training early
on, when I first met him,

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
he knew things about technology
that none of the other trainees

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:90%
knew.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:90%
And so he'd been exposed to it.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:90%
I knew that he had.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And they tell and educate
their citizens a lot more

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:90%
on what really happened.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I am absolutely
certain that they also

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:90%
provide them with propaganda.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:84%
But the origins, what happened
pre- and post-World War II,

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
what's happened on Earth, their
involvement with alien species,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:84%
the lessons that they've learned
from those involvements--

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
their people are a lot
more educated on that.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So World War II ends.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
We know the Germans
were developing the foo

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:84%
fighters and our
early UFO technology,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't save
themselves from the allies

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:90%
at the end of World War II.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
They were defeated,
so what happened?

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, in
the late '30s, there

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
were a number of
secret societies

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and the Vril Society
being one of them,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.430 align:middle line:84%
that the German state absorbed
into their R&D programs.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And they were already
visiting other planets

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.322 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the 1930s.

00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:54.015 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they had developed
technologies in the '30s?

00:03:54.015 --> 00:03:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: In the late '30s.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They had developed
these anti-gravity or saucer

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.407 align:middle line:84%
technologies that
allowed them to travel

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:90%
outside of our atmosphere.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And why didn't
Hitler use this

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.896 align:middle line:90%
for fighting in World War II?

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Well, he wanted to.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: But he didn't.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:90%
So why didn't he?

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The problem was that
they couldn't outfit these UFOs

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:84%
with modern
conventional weapons,

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
because of the second
law of momentum.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't shoot and
expect it to stay on place.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:84%
As you get a force
in this direction,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get a reaction
in the opposite direction.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And so since it's in the
air, they wouldn't work.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.084 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So conventional weaponry
doesn't work with zero-g craft?

00:04:33.084 --> 00:04:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Not unless
it's corrected.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.251 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
that advancement yet.

00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:90%
It does make sense.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.619 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were
trying to work on energy

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:90%
weapons in the early '40s.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:84%
The reptilian race was
helping the Germans--

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:84%
required that, we want you to
build a base in Antarctica.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Dracos, are you saying?

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.705 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Reptilians or the Dracos?

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.605 align:middle line:90%
Who are the Draco?

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The Draco are a
group of alien entities

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:90%
that are reptilian involved.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.405 align:middle line:84%
They range in height
from 8 to 14-feet tall.

00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:84%
It's my understanding
that there are also

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
some variations of them
that are shorter than that.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have
vestigial tails and wings.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: OK, so the Dracos
are now in an alliance

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.760 align:middle line:84%
with the Germans,
beginning of the 1940s?

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yes, and working
together with them.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: OK, so they
had gone to Antarctica

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.486 align:middle line:84%
in 1938, the first polar
expedition by the Germans.

00:05:23.486 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying in
the early '40s they were

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.720 align:middle line:90%
told to make the base there?

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.594 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were told
to build a base there.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they built a
base under the ice,

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
capable of sustaining upwards
of 3 to 400,000 people.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Whoa.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so they started
stocking it out and building it

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.832 align:middle line:90%
And the purpose for that--

00:05:41.832 --> 00:05:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and of course, the Draco didn't
tell them this at the time,

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:84%
but they wanted to have
a proxy in place that

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.010 align:middle line:84%
would help them recover some
of the alien technologies that

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.386 align:middle line:84%
were down there--
are down there.

00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:53.185 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I see.

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And they were-- of course,
nobody knows about the place,

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
so you could work with no one
knowing what you're doing.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Nobody around.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: It's the perfect place.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So the end of the
war marked a period

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:84%
where the group
that was down there

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
said, thankfully,
we can get away

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
from this self-destructive
government.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
We can run things
the way we want to,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
working on their base defenses,
working on their technology.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:84%
By 1947, they had mastered
the mobile platform weapons,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
so that they were able to
outfit their anti-gravity craft

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:90%
with these weapons.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Now, they have this
very serious advantage as far

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:90%
as weaponry.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.024 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Weapons, platforms.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
They outclassed anything and
everything else on the planet.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So we're now in '46, '47.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
It's after World War II
and a lot of UFO sightings

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:90%
are starting to happen--

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:90%
Maury Island and Roswell.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Are these associated
with the Germans?

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.339 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: From what I
understand, some of them are.

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they then alert
the governments of the world

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:90%
where they were located?

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They didn't tell
them where they were.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I see.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: But through
either espionage,

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:84%
or through other sources,
through capturing people

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.247 align:middle line:84%
that were in and out of South
America, they found out.

00:07:05.247 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:90%
The rest of the world did.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And the United States
in particular find out.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Specifically.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.023 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And then, what did the
United States do about it?

00:07:12.023 --> 00:07:15.640 align:middle line:84%
The fact that their enemy is,
like, creating a base on Earth

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
taking care of it?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, within a year
after the end of World War II,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:84%
they had already
started making plans

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
for sending a fleet down to
Antarctica to finally do away,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.050 align:middle line:84%
in their minds, with these
pesky Germans once and for all.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.995 align:middle line:84%
And so Operation Highjump
was the result of that.

00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And who led
this expedition?

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.287 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Admiral Byrd.

00:07:39.287 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Admiral Byrd?

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:10%
So what happened
when he got there?

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: When they got down
there in late November,

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:84%
they started setting
up their base

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
and establishing where they
were going to be operating from.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And they found the
German base and so ensued

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
a small action on the part of
a few UFOs that were actually

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.650 align:middle line:84%
armed with direct
energy weapons--

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
destroyed one ship,
killed a number of people,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and sent the entire
fleet packing back

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.520 align:middle line:90%
to the United States.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was the point at which
the Antarctic Germans started

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
negotiating with essentially the
Cabal, the rest of the world.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So Operation
Highjump essentially became

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:90%
operation hightail.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Hightail.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.027 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:08:23.027 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yes.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So Byrd-- then he comes
back to the United States.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:84%
And UFO sightings now really
start increasing-- abductions.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
What people don't realize is
even Betty and Barney Hill--

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
when they were abducted,
one of the things

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:84%
that characterizes
these missing people

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:84%
is that they have a
German background.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So are they stealing
people of German descent?

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yes, there's a
lot of German descent

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.960 align:middle line:84%
or German genetics
involved with those

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:84%
that either are part
of the current SSP,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:90%
or those that were abducted.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Part of the
negotiations that were

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:84%
occurring between the Antarctic
Germans and the Cabal--

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.330 align:middle line:84%
essentially, the Cabal were
given the list of requirements.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.520 align:middle line:84%
It established them as
a sovereign country.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.160 align:middle line:84%
It established embassies in
every country around the world.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
was required was

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.400 align:middle line:84%
that there would be between
one and five senior executives

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
from the Antarctic
German civilization, that

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
would be put into position
of senior executives

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
for every corporation around
the world that was aerospace,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.620 align:middle line:90%
automobile, petro-chem.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Basically, every major and
main industry on the planet

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.040 align:middle line:84%
now had between one and
five senior executives

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.260 align:middle line:90%
that were Mars Germans.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And I would guess
that Operation Paperclip is

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:90%
a result of this treaty.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.906 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Operation Paperclip
was the first stage of it.

00:09:51.906 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And what is
Operation Paperclip?

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Operation
Paperclip involved

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:02.770 align:middle line:84%
integrating German scientists,
and technicians, and engineers

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:84%
into corporations
of the Western world

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and getting them passports,
and setting them up

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.370 align:middle line:84%
with homes and jobs, and
basically, paving the way,

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:84%
opening the doors, and
laying out the red carpet.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It was basically
the United States.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And the Germans had
targeted the United States

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.776 align:middle line:90%
for its resources.

00:10:22.776 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:84%
They knew that the
manufacturing and resource

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.710 align:middle line:84%
abilities of the United
States were vastly larger

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:84%
than any other
country at the time.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So logical to infiltrate,
take over, and then use

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.575 align:middle line:84%
all of those corporations
to enhance your power.

00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:84%
The late '40s were
the same time period

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that the Mars Germans started
planning for and building

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.670 align:middle line:84%
their bases on the
moon as well as Mars.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was during
the late '40s period

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans, when
they went to the moon,

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:90%
discovered a couple of things.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.070 align:middle line:84%
They found out, number
one, that the moon

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
is an artificial
satellite construct.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was not originally
part of the Earth.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
It was brought there from
somewhere else as an escape

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.100 align:middle line:90%
ship.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And that it is built out inside.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And most of the real estate
is already spoken for.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when they were
wanting to find a base,

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't find space.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So the dozens of alien
races that are on the moon

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:90%
and have bases on the moon--

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.480 align:middle line:84%
they jealously guard
their property.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:90%
There's no fighting.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.169 align:middle line:84%
But if you try and take
over somebody else's land,

00:11:38.169 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:84%
they're allowed to
defend themselves.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sure.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.596 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And the Mars Germans
did not have technology

00:11:42.596 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:90%
to take that kind of fight.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So they had to find somebody
that was willing to part

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:90%
with some of their land.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And turns out that the Draco
either bribed, blackmailed,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:84%
or manipulated it so that the
only race the Germans could go

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:90%
to, to ask for-- was the Draco.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the negotiations
that ensued

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.090 align:middle line:84%
between the Draco
and the Mars Germans

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:90%
was for 20 acres of land.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And the Draco were
originally asking

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:84%
for 225 females and 50
years of first refusal

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
rights for the technology
that the Germans

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:90%
uncover in Antarctica.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Germans
immediately said

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.670 align:middle line:84%
there's no way we're
giving you 225 females.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
First off, it's a
practical matter.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
We need as many
childbearing females

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:84%
as we can to
continue our society.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So six months later, they
were able to hammer out

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
a deal where the Antarctic
Germans provided 150 males, 75

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
females, and they
gave the Germans 25

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.012 align:middle line:84%
years of first refusal
rights of the technology.

00:12:48.012 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The technology that was
under the ice in Antarctica?

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was under the ice.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
They had-- in a lot
of circumstances

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.019 align:middle line:90%
looked like a rock.

00:12:56.019 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know what they had.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sure.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: What later
the Germans found out

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.470 align:middle line:84%
is that there were at
least six other races that

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.230 align:middle line:84%
would have given them
twice the amount of space

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
for not a single person and
one-year worth of first refusal

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:90%
rights.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So the Germans were
suckered horribly.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:84%
The stories that my friend
told me during the exchange

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:84%
was very eye opening as
to the type of beings

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.255 align:middle line:90%
that they were dealing with.

00:13:26.255 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why did the
Dracos want these people?

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose?

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They wanted to
use them for experiments.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.600 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to use
them for manipulations.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Experiments?

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They wanted to
use them for food source.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.940 align:middle line:84%
There's any number of reasons
why they wanted to use them.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: For basically slaves?

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Slaves, slave
labor, for their own form

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:59.420 align:middle line:84%
of entertainment, and the many
forms that dark forces or dark

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:84%
agents want to abuse, or
use, or control, or destroy.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:90%
Those were the reasons.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That's really disturbing.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was very disturbing
to think that those people that

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.950 align:middle line:90%
were in negotiations.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I asked my
friend about that.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, what did the
negotiators think?

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:84%
You're handing over your
people to an unknown fate.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And his response
was they were there.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:90%
It was all business.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And besides, none
of their families

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.354 align:middle line:84%
were going to be the
ones turned over.

00:14:29.354 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do we know where
they got these people?

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was from their
own citizenry at that point.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh, really?

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:90%
So it was Germans.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Were they demanding German?

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, no, but that
was all they had access to

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:90%
at that early stage.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I see.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And the abductions that happened
later that really started

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:84%
ginning up in the
'50s and '60s--

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:90%
is this possibly--

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Part of that maybe, or
maybe additional agreements.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.950 align:middle line:84%
My suspicion is
that it was related

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:84%
to agreements with
other alien races

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
or for their own
testing purposes.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You mentioned
the Vril Society.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So the Vril Society had
somebody channeling?

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Maria Orsic was the channel
that they were using.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So this early channeling
was from extraterrestrials?

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And it was
real information

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:90%
that they were giving?

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And they doubted it
at first, until they

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
started building out what was
included in the blueprints.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:10%
And the drawings that were
made that were channeled

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:10%
were engineering drawings
that included sizes,

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:10%
and dimensions,
information on materials.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:84%
It included
everything they needed

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:90%
to do to recreate these craft.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And was Maria Orsic using
this information, because she

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:90%
wanted to conquer the world?

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Or what was her point in
channeling this information

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:90%
from these ETs?

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It's my
understanding that

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:84%
these original secret societies
were interested in advancing

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
the human experience,
and that they

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:84%
weren't primarily interested
in conquering or controlling

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.120 align:middle line:90%
other people.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, world
events turned out such

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
that they happened to
be stationed or located

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:84%
within a country that was
hell bent on world domination.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.690 align:middle line:10%
And so for their
own survival, they

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:10%
had to turn over and help
the Third Reich develop

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.244 align:middle line:10%
these advanced technologies.

00:16:29.244 --> 00:16:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It should also be
noted that the Germans have

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
had a fascination with this
stuff for 120 years now.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: More so.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there were
newspaper articles

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
about the ships that were
traveling up and down the West

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Coast and all the way
as far east as Texas.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, there were
a lot of information

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
out there about anti-gravity
or advanced technology

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:90%
going back to the 1800s.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The German advancement
of that technology

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.280 align:middle line:84%
while the Vril Society
and some of the others

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.440 align:middle line:84%
were channeled information,
that the Germans later did

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.109 align:middle line:84%
have direct contact
with the Draco

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and direct individual
interactions

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.630 align:middle line:90%
with those alien races.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.839 align:middle line:84%
And it included help on
some of their projects,

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.329 align:middle line:84%
help with the technologies
that they needed,

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:24.450 align:middle line:84%
help with memory
wiping technology,

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:29.490 align:middle line:84%
a number of various medicine,
transportation, communications,

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:90%
weaponry.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
The positively
oriented aliens that

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:84%
were trying to advance
the human race--

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:84%
they provided some of the
technology about anti-grav.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.630 align:middle line:90%
They did not-- the Germans--

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
they didn't get destructive
technology from those aliens.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
They got weapons and the
weaponizing technologies

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.400 align:middle line:84%
from other ones-- from
the Draco, specifically.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And it can be
said, without a doubt,

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:84%
that there's never been an
explosion of technology that

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:90%
occurred from 1938 to 1945--

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.429 align:middle line:84%
television, nuclear
weapons, lasers.

00:18:07.429 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:84%
There were so many things
that the Germans were--

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Microwaves.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: --working on.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: You name it.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: --amazing.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were
so many of them.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And right now, we
are 1951 or so in our story.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:90%
And we know we've--

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:84%
developing these anti-gravity
vehicles and other things.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So the United States is
being changed by this ordeal.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Historically, a very
pregnant moment.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, absolutely.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:84%
The late '40s marked
a very crucial moment

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:84%
in the development of the
Antarctic German civilization.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:84%
That was when they
started building out

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:90%
their bases away from Earth.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to build
a base on the moon

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and had to find
somebody that was

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:90%
willing to give up real estate.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And those that--

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Draco were the
ones that they were

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:90%
able to get real estate from.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And the deal that they made
was for a 100-year lease.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
The agreement included
assistance with technology.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
The Draco weren't going to
hand over advanced technology

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:11.760 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:84%
They were providing them with
assistance on the advanced

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:84%
technologies and had
continued to do that.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:84%
The story that
Yohan relayed to me

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:84%
about the very disturbing
exchange that happened--

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:84%
the Antarctic Germans
did not tell the people

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that were being traded
what they were doing

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.266 align:middle line:90%
and where they were going to.

00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:84%
They had 53 guards that
were there that were armed.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:90%
The Dracos showed up.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
They herded all these
people into a cavern

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:84%
that they were
supposed to meet at

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and activated some type of stun
device, which froze everybody

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:90%
in place.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.460 align:middle line:84%
The images that they
were psychically

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:84%
sending to everybody
in that cavern

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.890 align:middle line:90%
were only able to be told about.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Because two of the guards
were outside the field

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:90%
radius when it happened.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:90%
The images that they were seen--

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:19.100 align:middle line:84%
that were sent included human
on human mutilation, assault,

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:90%
cannibalism.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Just about every type of
deprivation and mutilation

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:84%
imaginable was sent
to these people.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Psychically?

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Psychically of
their own family members.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Why would they do that?

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They wanted
to scare them,

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.275 align:middle line:84%
because they thought
it was funny--

00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:90%
is the only thing I can think--

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:84%
is that there was some-- to
them it was entertaining.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So the two guards that
were outside the field ran.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.870 align:middle line:84%
There were three that were
outside the field initially,

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.150 align:middle line:84%
but one of them on
his way to the exit

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:90%
was caught by the field.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Caught in the field?

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.296 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Caught in the field.

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:84%
The Draco that were there
to pick up their subjects

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.579 align:middle line:90%
were in full battle armor.

00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And so there was nothing
that any of those guards

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
could have done to harm them,
much less try and protect

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.460 align:middle line:90%
the people.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Besides, they were
there to turn them over.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:14.760 align:middle line:84%
The two guards that did survive
were never the same afterwards.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they weren't able
to be conscious without going

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:84%
into extreme distress
or going psychotic.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And it took, from
what I understand,

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:84%
about a year for them
to get to a point

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:84%
where they wouldn't go
into a catatonic state.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally, they both
suicided about five years

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.370 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:90%
And so all told that they--

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:84%
the Draco took 278 souls,
and that repeated requests

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.800 align:middle line:84%
by the Germans about
the whereabouts

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:84%
or the remains were
never answered.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So these were the type of
beings that the Germans

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.400 align:middle line:90%
were dealing with.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And they'd vowed
from that day forward

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
that they would never
exchange their own people

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.000 align:middle line:90%
if they needed to.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.130 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, they would.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they would find
other sources of people

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.550 align:middle line:90%
to be used as pawns.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:90%
So that was in the late '40s.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And that got them
the 20 acres of land

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:84%
on the moon to build the
Lunar Operations Command.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, that has to
be a pretty pivotal moment

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:84%
for this whole thing, because
you're finally off-planet.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And you have a base
off-planet, which

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.880 align:middle line:84%
can allow you to then go
to other places in a much

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:90%
easier fashion.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.638 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:29.070 align:middle line:84%
That was also
around the same time

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.690 align:middle line:84%
they started perusing
for Mar's real estate.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.610 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
Mars is that there

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:84%
are sections of the planet
that are highly energetic.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can't build anything
with electronics, because

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:84%
of the charged particles
in the atmosphere.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's only certain areas
that they can build out.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, for them at
that time, they were occupied.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So they had to create
a big bridgehead

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and fight for the property
that they wanted--

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.387 align:middle line:90%
the land that they needed.

00:22:58.387 --> 00:22:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Who did they fight?

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Oh, they
were alien races.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.110 align:middle line:90%
On Mars?

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: On Mars.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Not Draco?

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.092 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Not Draco.

00:23:05.092 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do you know
what they looked like?

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I don't know.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did the Germans
succeed in this battle?

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It took them
about 10 years--

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --and cost them over
17,000 lives in doing it.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And 17,000 may not sound
like a large number.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you do
percentage wise, it

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:84%
accounts for all of the
allies' losses in World War II,

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:90%
percentage wise--

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:27.708 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Percentage wise?

00:23:27.708 --> 00:23:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: --of their population.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:90%
So it was a large number.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was also the
most productive,

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:84%
the youngest, the most active
portions of their society.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So they were reeling
from those losses

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:84%
when they first established
their Mars base.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, they
stepped up their negotiations

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
with the Cabal, because
they needed not only

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.180 align:middle line:84%
to have a final treaty, but
primarily, they needed people.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:57.590 align:middle line:84%
They needed active people that
can do what they needed to do.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So they stepped up
their negotiations

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
with the Cabal, which accounts
for the extremely large number

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:84%
of UFO sightings
in the early '50s,

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and including the 1952 mass
sighting over Washington, DC

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.480 align:middle line:90%
itself over two weekends.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you think
that was the Germans?

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:20.438 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That was the Germans.

00:24:20.438 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: To show a force?

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.345 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Show a force.

00:24:22.345 --> 00:24:24.320 align:middle line:84%
They were trying
to force the hand.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.826 align:middle line:84%
And they still could not
get the Cabal to talk.

00:24:26.826 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, that seems
to be about the time,

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.320 align:middle line:84%
though, that the
back of their Cabal

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:90%
was broken by the Germans.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And Yohan seemed to think
that the final straw--

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:84%
because the Antarctic Germans
kept telling the Cabal, look,

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:40.807 align:middle line:90%
we've got nukes.

00:24:40.807 --> 00:24:41.890 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to test us.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't believe it.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was
provided a demonstration

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:52.100 align:middle line:84%
strike on a lonely, single,
heavy cruiser returning

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
from Bikini Atoll, from one
of the US's own nuclear tests.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And they dropped a
small yield device,

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:84%
close enough that the
EMP disabled the ship.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
What they had was they
had four of their saucers

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.035 align:middle line:90%
on station at 60 kilometers.

00:25:14.035 --> 00:25:15.430 align:middle line:90%
It's what Yohan told me.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:90%
It's about 200,000 feet.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.710 align:middle line:90%
They fired the munition.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And the three of them stayed
on station at altitude.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.510 align:middle line:90%
They waited for it to explode.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And then after they had
enough time to safely go down,

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.680 align:middle line:90%
one of the UFOs--

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.210 align:middle line:84%
the Germans' UFOs descended
within five seconds down

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
to within 100 feet of the
stricken heavy cruiser.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:84%
The heavy cruiser
crew tried shooting

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:84%
at the one UFO with the weapons
that were still operational,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.041 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't hit it.

00:25:51.041 --> 00:25:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So they gave up and went
about repairing the ship,

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.170 align:middle line:84%
so they could limp
back to Hawaii.

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And what is an EMP?

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: An electromagnetic pulse
is an invisible energy field

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.500 align:middle line:84%
that emanates from
a nuclear detonation

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
that interrupts
electronics, melts wires,

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.799 align:middle line:84%
basically wreaks havoc on
anything that's modern.

00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So they killed the ship?

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.832 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They killed the
ship without destroying it.

00:26:15.832 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: As a
demonstration of power?

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're
bringing up this idea

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:84%
that I think it might
be surprising to people.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people
think that the Antarctic

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Germans are part of the Cabal,
but in fact, they aren't.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They're not.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Are they
against the Cabal?

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were very
vehemently against the Cabal.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, Yohan
referred to them

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:44.452 align:middle line:84%
as the Earth's shite royals
They didn't like them at all.

00:26:44.452 --> 00:26:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They didn't
like the Cabal at all?

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And they blamed the Cabal
for what happened to Germany?

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yes, following World
War I and losing World War II.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.800 align:middle line:84%
What did Yohan say the Germans
on Mars were the most proud of?

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were proud of
not being a part of the Cabal

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and being able to dictate
terms to the Cabal.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they liked being
an adversary to the Cabal?

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: There's still a
base up on Mars right now.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.740 align:middle line:84%
They sent these messages to all
the royal families in Europe.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.290 align:middle line:84%
They sent it to the President
of the United States.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:22.400 align:middle line:84%
They sent it to the prime
minister of Germany.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:84%
They sent it to the head of the
Communist Party of the USSR.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
making sure that there

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:84%
was no misunderstanding
that what they intended,

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:90%
what they were capable of.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
want the US to say,

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:90%
oh, no, we never got a message.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.740 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get anything.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So the cat was out of
the bag at this point.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.946 align:middle line:84%
The entire world knew
what they were capable of

00:27:42.946 --> 00:27:44.070 align:middle line:90%
and what they were wanting.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And they were wanting
a formalized treaty.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And they got it.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:47.953 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They got it.

00:27:47.953 --> 00:27:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Soon after.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:49.769 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Very soon after.

00:27:49.769 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It took about four years
to get the wording right--

00:27:55.690 --> 00:28:00.510 align:middle line:84%
1954 to 1959--
four or five years.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Antarctic Treaty is the
result of those negotiations.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And what was
given and what was

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:90%
taken in these negotiations?

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, the non-publicized
portion of the treaty

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:84%
includes, again, reaffirming
the sovereign nation

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.490 align:middle line:90%
of the Antarctic Germans.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.650 align:middle line:84%
It required the Cabal
to provide upwards

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:84%
of 150 to 200,000 people
to the Antarctic Germans.

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And these weren't dregs
of society either.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:35.160 align:middle line:84%
They had very specific IQ and
physical requirements of people

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:90%
that they wanted.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.293 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And this was in the '50s?

00:28:37.293 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: This was the brain
drain of the 1950s and '60s.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: '60s, actually.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.690 align:middle line:84%
That's when the brain drain
started, around '60, '61.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah, late '50s.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.946 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Makes a lot of sense.

00:28:46.946 --> 00:28:47.865 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: 1959.

00:28:47.865 --> 00:28:50.360 align:middle line:84%
They also increased
their requirement

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.330 align:middle line:84%
from not just senior
executives, but they now

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:57.530 align:middle line:84%
wanted between one and
five board member seats

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:84%
on all the corporations that
they had senior executives in.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.920 align:middle line:84%
They also required a
permanent, lifetime position

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.110 align:middle line:84%
within the executive
branch of each government

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.380 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that
was a Mars German.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And so it solidified
their positions

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.680 align:middle line:90%
within the governments.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So now, they had
people that were

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.980 align:middle line:90%
within each of these companies.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't hard for
them to work their way up

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
from vice president
to president,

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:84%
because they give their people
some advanced technologies

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.170 align:middle line:90%
to take to their companies.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're fast-tracked,
because they are these

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:84%
brainchilds that brought
this wonderful product--

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.380 align:middle line:90%
A or B to the table.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And now, the company is
making a lot of money,

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:90%
so it self propagates.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:84%
That's still going
on, by the way.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.683 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: And it's still going on.

00:29:43.683 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So was the Cabal
worried about these traders

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:84%
coming in and mixing with
their people and all that?

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.420 align:middle line:90%
They must have been concerned.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They were concerned.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:90%
But the Cabal took it as--

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:84%
looking at it from
the long game.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:84%
They knew that they've survived
for close to a thousand years

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.600 align:middle line:84%
already through regime
change, wars, you name it.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:84%
They've survived, and thrived,
and maintained their control.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So they were looking at
it from the long game.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:20.660 align:middle line:84%
There were two operations that
traveled down to Antarctica

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.700 align:middle line:90%
during these negotiations--

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Operation Deep Freeze I and
Operation Deep Freeze II.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Deep Freeze.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And those were,
again, the smokescreen

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.780 align:middle line:84%
for exploration, where
actually they were part

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.550 align:middle line:90%
of the negotiations involved.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:84%
One of the Cabal members
died of a heart attack

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:84%
during the negotiations
out of fear

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:42.680 align:middle line:84%
from things coming
forward and going public.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So they ended up
with these positions

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.060 align:middle line:84%
with a permanent seat
in the government.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:52.970 align:middle line:84%
They ended up with upwards
of 150 to 200,000 people

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.010 align:middle line:84%
to be delivered where
and when they wanted.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And where
did these people go?

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: These people turned
into the factory workers--

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:06.960 align:middle line:84%
non-desirable jobs that their
society didn't want to have.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:14.330 align:middle line:84%
They filled the manufacturing,
for housekeeping, any of what

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:17.750 align:middle line:84%
would be considered menial
jobs that their people were

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:21.170 align:middle line:84%
too busy, or doing other
things, or didn't want to do.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So we're in the '60s.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Cabal is
doing this kind of--

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:90%
being a double agent.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.540 align:middle line:84%
They're acting like they're
OK with all of this.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.760 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, they're
probably developing everything

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.540 align:middle line:90%
on their own.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They were trying to.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.450 align:middle line:90%
They were scheming.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Again, thinking
from the long game,

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.160 align:middle line:84%
they knew that there
was nothing that they

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.240 align:middle line:90%
could do at that point.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And the thought of this
information going public

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:90%
was not palatable to them.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So the only alternative
they had was destruction

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:90%
in order to go along with it.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.840 align:middle line:10%
So what they did was
they couldn't do anything

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.990 align:middle line:10%
immediately, because
the major technology

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.810 align:middle line:10%
advantage that the
Germans had at that time

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:02.150 align:middle line:10%
was the mind wipe technology.

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Anything and everything
that was developed,

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.400 align:middle line:84%
no matter how classified, was
subject, or had opportunity,

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.540 align:middle line:84%
or there was a
chance it could leak.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.855 align:middle line:84%
The Antarctic Germans
had people in all

00:32:13.855 --> 00:32:15.680 align:middle line:90%
of these different positions.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So they knew all of the
advanced technologies

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.540 align:middle line:90%
that were being developed.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.190 align:middle line:84%
That's why you see so many of
these classified programs that

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:27.565 align:middle line:84%
to the outside world
had so much promise.

00:32:27.565 --> 00:32:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But why did they stop
or kill the project?

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's either because it
was infringing on the Antarctic

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Germans' technologies, or it
was taken over by the Antarctic

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Germans and moved
to their facilities

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and away from the public
and the rest of the world.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So it's safe to
say the Cabal is also

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:52.580 align:middle line:84%
forming a secret space
program, or at least they're

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.770 align:middle line:90%
planning on it.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were putting
the plans together.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But they had to
overcome that one

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:84%
handicap that was
limiting them--

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:90%
that mind wipe technology.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And the Germans had to
have been way more advanced

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:84%
technologically over
the Cabal at this stage,

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.550 align:middle line:84%
just because they're in
alliance with the Draco.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.559 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting
all this inside info.

00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And they're pretty good at being
engineers themselves anyway.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:16.290 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.410 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
manipulate and control

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:22.970 align:middle line:84%
what technologies got
released to which governments.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that they wanted
to keep for themselves--

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:29.540 align:middle line:84%
they had contacts and people
in the governments that

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:33.440 align:middle line:84%
would force the programs to
be shut down in the budget,

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.470 align:middle line:84%
because, well, they wanted
to take them private.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.670 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to move them
into their facilities.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: All right.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So the Germans now have a base
on Mars, a base on the moon.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.030 align:middle line:84%
They're in league
with the Draco.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.114 align:middle line:90%
They're against the Cabal.

00:33:48.114 --> 00:33:49.738 align:middle line:84%
They're playing a
dance with the Cabal,

00:33:49.738 --> 00:33:51.650 align:middle line:84%
though, even though
they're against them.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:52.525 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:33:52.525 --> 00:33:56.404 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: We're moving forward
now and into the '70s.

00:33:56.404 --> 00:33:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And in the early '70s,
that marked the time period

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.390 align:middle line:84%
when the Antarctic Germans'
25-year first refusal

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:90%
rights with the Draco ended.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.929 align:middle line:84%
And so they were able to
focus more of their attention

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:12.579 align:middle line:84%
on building and more advanced
technologies themselves.

00:34:12.579 --> 00:34:14.120 align:middle line:84%
That's when they
started building out

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.659 align:middle line:84%
their fleet of interstellar
ships and crafts.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So through the '70s,
the rest of the Cabal

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:27.110 align:middle line:84%
were trying to bury money
through the Space Race program.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.060 align:middle line:90%
And make no mistake.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.330 align:middle line:84%
At the highest levels, there
was friendly communications

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:36.710 align:middle line:84%
between the East and West--
the USSR and the USA.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.679 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
common enemy, which

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:41.989 align:middle line:90%
was the Antarctic Germans.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they both used
their enormous budgets

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.320 align:middle line:84%
for their Space Race
program to funnel

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and poor money into these
secret projects and which,

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.949 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, they were
wanting to try and build up

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:57.730 align:middle line:84%
their own space
faring abilities.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:02.150 align:middle line:84%
It still came down to having
that mind wipe technology.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the 1970s, that's

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:09.350 align:middle line:84%
when the Cabal moved
and actually acquired

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.560 align:middle line:84%
one of the mind wiping
technology wands

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.260 align:middle line:90%
from the Antarctic Germans.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
sneak aboard a shuttle.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.680 align:middle line:84%
There were thousands of people
across the planet involved.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.860 align:middle line:84%
But just like the
Manhattan Project,

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.212 align:middle line:84%
which had over 100,000
people working on it,

00:35:27.212 --> 00:35:28.670 align:middle line:84%
there were only a
handful of people

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.890 align:middle line:90%
that knew the full scope of it.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.786 align:middle line:90%
So same principle here.

00:35:32.786 --> 00:35:34.910 align:middle line:84%
There were hundreds of
thousands of people involved

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.010 align:middle line:84%
in this project in some
way or remote form,

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.210 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't know what
the ultimate goal was.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:45.320 align:middle line:84%
They were a total of five people
that knew the actual scope

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.640 align:middle line:90%
and goal of the plan.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:52.780 align:middle line:84%
There were three CIA operatives
and two KGB operatives.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And those three were
guarded around the clock

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.350 align:middle line:84%
until the operation
was completed.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But what they did was
they were able to sneak

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.850 align:middle line:84%
aboard an Antarctic German
shuttle and disable the crew,

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:07.300 align:middle line:84%
obtain one of these
devices, and then cause

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:11.170 align:middle line:84%
a self-destruct on the shuttle,
which was probably just a bomb

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.960 align:middle line:84%
placed on the outside
of the fusion bottle,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and disintegrated in
a ball of gas and fire

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:84%
higher than the sun
over the Pacific.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Yohan believes that they
did a high-low jump--

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.630 align:middle line:84%
high-altitude, low opening
out of the shuttle.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they got their
hands on it without having

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.550 align:middle line:90%
any fingerprints.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So it took them three
years to reverse engineer

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.540 align:middle line:90%
that technology.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the scientists

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.560 align:middle line:84%
that were working
on it got to be

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.740 align:middle line:84%
the first victims of the
technology in which they

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.020 align:middle line:90%
were mind wiped--

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.880 align:middle line:84%
had no idea that they
were even involved in such

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.830 align:middle line:90%
a large technological advance.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why were they so
interested in the mind wipe?

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.766 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, because then
they were able to assure that

00:36:54.766 --> 00:36:56.140 align:middle line:84%
their technologies--
because they

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.320 align:middle line:84%
knew they had holes and leaks,
and that the Antarctic Germans

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:84%
infiltrated every level of
their classified programs.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And so they had no means of
protecting themselves or being

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.800 align:middle line:84%
able to develop
things in secret.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Because the Antarctic Germans
knew every project and program

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.550 align:middle line:84%
they were working on, they
were able to manipulate

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and either kill the project
and take it private,

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.870 align:middle line:90%
or just do away with it.

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So having that technology
allowed them to now

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:28.030 align:middle line:84%
have clandestine operations,
and programs, and R&D projects,

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:32.980 align:middle line:84%
where they were fairly assured
that the knowledge of it

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.590 align:middle line:90%
wasn't going to get out.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that accounts for
the technological advances

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.680 align:middle line:90%
in the early '80s.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.830 align:middle line:84%
It allows-- it accounts
for the original holes

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that they started building
for Operation Solar Warden.

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, as
soon as the device

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:57.780 align:middle line:84%
was in the hands of the
Cabal, all of but two

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.870 align:middle line:84%
of the agents that knew the
full scope of the program

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:04.052 align:middle line:84%
were mysteriously
killed, or died, or--

00:38:04.052 --> 00:38:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: The five agents?

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: The five.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:90%
All but two.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Two CIA agents survived, but
lived the rest of their lives

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:11.040 align:middle line:90%
in hiding.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're
saying there really

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.120 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a Cold War either.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.120 align:middle line:90%
It was like a facade.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.078 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:38:16.078 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:84%
That was a means for them to
siphon off and funnel money

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:22.710 align:middle line:84%
into their black projects
or into developing

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.270 align:middle line:90%
advanced technologies.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And we've been working
with the Russians in secret,

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.930 align:middle line:90%
then, for a long time?

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah, we have.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So what's Solar Warden?

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Operation Solar
Warden was the Earth's version

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.202 align:middle line:84%
of a space fleet, in which
they were getting into space

00:38:38.202 --> 00:38:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and actually able
to start building

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.710 align:middle line:84%
holes to further their
projection of power

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:45.030 align:middle line:90%
out from the planet.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And this is probably what
Reagan was referring to in his

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.939 align:middle line:90%
diaries where he said that--

00:38:49.939 --> 00:38:52.230 align:middle line:84%
he then briefed and told
there was a space shuttle that

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.216 align:middle line:90%
could house 300 men.

00:38:53.216 --> 00:38:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:56.450 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
he was referring to.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So this was
late '70s, early '80s

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.865 align:middle line:84%
that Solar Warden is
beginning to be formed?

00:39:00.865 --> 00:39:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So is Solar Warden
solely the United States'

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.780 align:middle line:90%
program or the Cabal's program?

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Or who is behind Solar Warden?

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The Solar Warden was
a United States operation.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And its point
was to emulate what

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.082 align:middle line:90%
the Germans had already done?

00:39:15.082 --> 00:39:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's correct--
and to try and advance

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.130 align:middle line:84%
their own technologies
and project their power

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.620 align:middle line:84%
onto other planetary
surfaces as well as

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.330 align:middle line:90%
through our own solar system.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And did the United
States succeed at this?

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.400 align:middle line:90%
They created their own fleet.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did the United States
have a base on the moon

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.780 align:middle line:90%
like the Germans did?

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Eventually, they got one.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:40.710 align:middle line:84%
In the mid-1980s in 1986,
the Antarctic Germans

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:42.540 align:middle line:84%
had been researching
and studying.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:84%
They knew that something
was wrong with the shuttle

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.310 align:middle line:84%
explosion over the
Pacific shuttle.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Where they stole the wand?

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Where they
stole the wand.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.418 align:middle line:84%
They knew that something
wasn't right about it,

00:39:52.418 --> 00:39:54.549 align:middle line:84%
but they couldn't
prove how or who.

00:39:54.549 --> 00:39:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So it took them eight years,
but they did find out how.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.537 align:middle line:84%
And it came back
to that shuttle.

00:39:58.537 --> 00:40:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And it took them a
little while longer

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.270 align:middle line:90%
to figure out the who-- was.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And when they did,
they did two things.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.970 align:middle line:84%
They sent a message to
the two perpetrators--

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.770 align:middle line:90%
the USA and the USSR.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And they moved all of
their manufacturing and R&D

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.160 align:middle line:84%
off-planet to their
facilities on Mars.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.270 align:middle line:84%
The space shuttle Challenger
destruction in February of 1986

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.980 align:middle line:90%
was the first message.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And the destruction
of the cooling towers

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:27.830 align:middle line:84%
at Chernobyl in the USSR
was the second message.

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Both of them were done from
orbit from an orbital platform.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And the Antarctic Germans
would have done more,

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:39.830 align:middle line:84%
except they were worried about
the cowboy president resorting

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:40.820 align:middle line:90%
to nukes.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But they took
that shuttle explosion

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.120 align:middle line:84%
as a precursor to the idea that
they had better take everything

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.240 align:middle line:90%
off Earth and get out.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, they knew
that the mind wipe

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.960 align:middle line:84%
technology was out of
the bag and in the hands

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.690 align:middle line:90%
of multiple other countries.

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.550 align:middle line:90%
And so along with those--

00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:59.960 align:middle line:84%
the destruction
of the Challenger

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and the destruction of
the cooling towers--

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:05.590 align:middle line:84%
each of the leaders of the
governments of those two

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:10.890 align:middle line:84%
countries received
a plain brown box.

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Inside the box was a
non-operational memory

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:18.320 align:middle line:84%
wipe device with the Antarctic
German coat of arms on it.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And stamped on the outside
was the exact date and time

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.380 align:middle line:84%
of the shuttle explosion
eight years prior.
