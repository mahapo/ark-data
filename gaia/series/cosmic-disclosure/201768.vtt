00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.920 align:middle line:10%
we are talking about disclosure
with Randy Veitenheimer.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, Randy is an
explorer, and a researcher

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:10%
of human consciousness
and existence,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:10%
and a mentor and colleague
of mine for many years.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
Hello, Emery.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Randy, Disclosure has
been going on since the 1950s.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, where has it gotten us?

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
From 1950s to today,
what was the strategy?

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: The idea is, you
would interrupt a disruptive

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.250 align:middle line:84%
narrative or a disruptive
body of knowledge.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Think about it as
introducing a new religion,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and the effects of that, and
what that would do to society.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:84%
If you were concerned
about that--

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.709 align:middle line:90%
and the US government was.

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:84%
There were several
programs and articles--

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:90%
research that was done.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if the aliens
landed on the White House lawn?

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And how it would destroy the
narratives of our religions.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
It would destroy the narrative
of our existence, of where

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.460 align:middle line:84%
we came from, of what
our place in the universe

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:84%
is, forget about our
place in society.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, those
are the basic questions

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying to
answer through Disclosure.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:84%
The things that the
government researched back

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:84%
in the late '30s,
'40s, '50s was,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
how would you integrate
this information?

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.850 align:middle line:84%
The people in charge of
those research projects

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
came up with that it would
be detrimental for humans

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.910 align:middle line:84%
to know that there
was alien life,

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:84%
or that there were
other existences

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:90%
or aspects to the universe.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.880 align:middle line:90%
and so it became a big problem.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So the immediate action
that came into play

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:90%
was to deny it all.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:84%
We know this with
our airline pilots.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:84%
For 50 years, they've been
told, you did not see a UFO.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.663 align:middle line:90%
It's like back to Star Wars.

00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
"These are not the droids
you're looking for."

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle line:90%
These are not the UFOs you saw.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:90%
And don't report them.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Don't say nothing
or we'll can you.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can find all
of this information.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, that would
indicate some sort of a program

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:84%
or coordinated effort to
limit the knowledge that's

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:90%
available to us.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%
There were people that
said, no, no, no, humanity

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:84%
can handle the answer
that we're not alone.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
They can handle the
answer that there's

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.900 align:middle line:84%
abilities to advance ourself
in science and technology way

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:90%
beyond where we are now.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And I've been lucky
enough to work

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
with some of those
scientists over the years.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.423 align:middle line:84%
We were doing things
back in the '70s

00:03:02.423 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:84%
that they're just now
starting admit, well, it

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:90%
might be possible.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we would
say that the government

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.400 align:middle line:90%
is controlling it.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:90%
But we have influencers.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And so any information that
becomes out into society

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:84%
becomes something that
either needs to be accented

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:84%
or something needs to be
controlled or eliminated.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And we can find all
kinds of technologies

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:90%
where this has happened.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:84%
In the '60s, I was driving a
car that got 40 miles a gallon.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And right now, they
go, hey, this car

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.568 align:middle line:90%
gets 36 miles to the gallon.

00:03:39.568 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What a bargain.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Yeah.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking 50
years of advancement.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.998 align:middle line:84%
And that's no
advancement at all.

00:03:45.998 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same thing is true
in the electric generation

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:90%
they said in the other.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Historically, what they allow--

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and this is what most
of the scientists

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.910 align:middle line:90%
and anybody out there knows--

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:84%
is that you can
present something

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
that's 10% better
than what's existing.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
You can present
something that's 15%.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot
present something,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.230 align:middle line:84%
or develop a technology,
and present it to society,

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
that moves beyond the
current paradigm, like 100%.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What happens when
the countries and politics get

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.949 align:middle line:90%
involved?

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:84%
China just announced they're
going to have a base on Mars

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:90%
in 2025.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk is saying it's going
to be a little bit longer.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
When you have this
power control of,

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:84%
who's going to
get to Mars first,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:84%
using these newer
technologies that

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to come out
to do it, what's that endgame?

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Well, it's the
concept of hierarchy.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Who's number one in the world.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Here we go again.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Right?

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Who's number one?

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, it depends
on where you are.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
If I'm German, Chinese,
India, United States--

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
just pick somebody,
and we're number one.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of
hierarchy in that aspect

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:84%
is just like what we
did with the Soviets.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
The Soviets put up Sputnik and
they said, we're the first.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:84%
We're the first to have
something in space.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.300 align:middle line:84%
We actually had one a couple
of years in advance of that,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.070 align:middle line:90%
but we don't talk about that.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
sequestering and denial.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.425 align:middle line:84%
Then, well, we need to get
to the moon before them.

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:84%
What makes you
think there wasn't

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:90%
a Russian landing before ours?

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the Russians don't
talk about their mistakes.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And we don't either, by the way.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So what you have is this ongoing
sequester, denial, and ongoing,

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.052 align:middle line:90%
"now, let's develop it."

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
thing with people

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that come in with tangential
information flows that

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:90%
are counterintelligence.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
They're moving in that
information or those people

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.500 align:middle line:84%
so that you begin to
doubt yourself, or begin

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
to doubt the technology,
or nobody believes you,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
or they find fault
with you because you

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
didn't have good grades in
high school or something.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's always--
they make something.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Because they have to
attack the individual.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:84%
They can't attack
the information.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:84%
When they can't attack
the information then,

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.460 align:middle line:84%
basically, I'm an idiot,
or you're an idiot,

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:90%
or something's going on.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it in the
interest of the corporations

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:90%
to disclose?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.422 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: No.

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Because they
wouldn't benefit, right?

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Right.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is,
in the United States,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.090 align:middle line:84%
we made corporations
individuals.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.280 align:middle line:90%
You can find all of this.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And so a corporation
has individual rights,

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:84%
as defined by the
Constitution, let's say.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And if, as an owner
of a corporation,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I have shareholders, I
have beneficial intent

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.950 align:middle line:90%
to my shareholders.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.470 align:middle line:90%
That's the language.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:84%
If I fail to do that, then
I'm acting in bad faith

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and I'm guilty of
fiduciary responsibilities.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So if a corporation engages
in technological research,

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:84%
they have a fundamental
responsibility

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:90%
to their shareholders.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:84%
If you're not a
shareholder, they

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.423 align:middle line:84%
don't have a
responsibility to you.

00:07:19.423 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:84%
If we say the United
States government--

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:84%
or any government--
has responsibility

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:84%
to its shareholders,
to its citizens,

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:84%
then, well, each individual
has their own responsibilities,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:90%
too, for their own well-being.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the governments.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But corporations are
in a unique place

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.640 align:middle line:84%
to be able to determine
not only what's

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
beneficial for their
shareholders, but again,

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
at what pace do they want
to feed this stuff out?

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.733 align:middle line:84%
They can say, next
quarter, I'm going

00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:90%
to make a little more money.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Three quarters
from now, I'm going

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.402 align:middle line:84%
to introduce an
electric car and make

00:07:54.402 --> 00:07:55.897 align:middle line:90%
a ton more money, and then--

00:07:55.897 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:90%
you see what I mean?

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How would you get
something just undisclosed

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and out to the public since
we can't use the corporations?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.050 align:middle line:84%
What I would do is, I
would develop something

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle line:84%
that I knew it was
going to be a problem--

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.967 align:middle line:84%
that the government and
corporations have a problem.

00:08:09.967 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I would find a
really good organization.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: OK.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:90%
And a couple of things.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Number one, your
example of cell phones.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.770 align:middle line:90%
The cell phone technology--

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Apple just introduced
their last cell phone.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:84%
What makes you think that
next cell phone doesn't exist?

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:84%
And the one after it,
and the one after it?

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:84%
And so we would say, how
many modules are they ahead?

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
they're probably seven--

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:84%
at least seven-- iterations
ahead of where they are now.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they introduce the
seventh iteration right now,

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow, what happened to 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16?

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those is capable
of making a lot of money.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's no advantage to
hopscotching and advancing

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.280 align:middle line:90%
the technology that fast--

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:84%
from a financial
standpoint, but not

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.380 align:middle line:90%
from a beneficial standpoint.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Because technology
benefits humans.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you lose
sight of that is

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:90%
when you create the problems.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So the cell phone technology
is very appropriate.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going on
with the corporations,

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:84%
their fiduciary
responsibility, and why

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:90%
that is where the action is.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It's who was hiring
you to do the work

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
in the projects, or Los Alamos,
or wherever else I've been.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
The second part of
that is that I've

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.380 align:middle line:84%
worked with other scientists,
and literally 15, 20 years ago,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.920 align:middle line:84%
we came up a new
zero-point technology.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's just so
simple it's stupid.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
most advances are.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Because it's an "a-ha" moment.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:84%
It's just field
capture of the energy

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
flowing through an
armature or flowing

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:90%
through an electric wire.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the easiest
way to look at it.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.698 align:middle line:84%
Energy flows through a human,
we get an energy field.

00:10:05.698 --> 00:10:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Electricity flows
through a wire and we get

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:90%
a little electromagnetic field.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:90%
And we can tap into that.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:90%
And we do that.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:90%
And birds do it.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not, oh, my god,
some secret knowledge.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
working with the physicists I

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.540 align:middle line:84%
was working with,
and mathematicians--

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.430 align:middle line:84%
we introduced it to University
of Pittsburgh, I believe--

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:90%
we'll say.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And they said it's not
possible because it

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:84%
doesn't fit the current
theory of thermodynamics

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.770 align:middle line:90%
and electricity.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we introduced it
to a Japanese corporation.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'll mention them.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:90%
They had, say, 1,000 7-Elevens.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're going like, we
just put this device in

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and it cuts your energy
usage down to about 20%.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:90%
And they freaked out.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we told them
we could cut 20%,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.718 align:middle line:84%
we would have probably
got the funding.

00:10:58.718 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:84%
But when we told
them we could cut it

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:90%
to 20%, that's not possible.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:90%
The denial comes in.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can't
comprehend the technology,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:84%
you have no business
condemning it.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we have.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:84%
We have all of these experts
to condemn any new technology,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.760 align:middle line:84%
any new idea, because
if it doesn't--

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.800 align:middle line:84%
if it comes out too
fast, then you've

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.230 align:middle line:84%
cheated somebody out of
their corporate profits.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:90%
That's one way to look at it.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's that
whole denial group,

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.070 align:middle line:90%
the ones that would sequester.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.372 align:middle line:90%
And it became very powerful.

00:11:32.372 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
so well-funded,

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we don't see
the advances we should see.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, cancer treatment
has been the same

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.347 align:middle line:90%
for the last sixty years.

00:11:40.347 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
the amount of money

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.555 align:middle line:84%
that has been spent
on cancer research,

00:11:43.555 --> 00:11:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and you tell me there's
been no advancement?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.750 align:middle line:90%
Chemotherapy and radiation.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:90%
It beggars the imagination.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's terrible.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Now, that's
just cancer research.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Think about-- we could go
down a list a mile long.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:90%
And it makes no sense.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.960 align:middle line:90%
It's nonsensical.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who is
suppressing that?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: And that's
what we're seeing.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.517 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who is
suppressing this, then?

00:12:03.517 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
All of this-- we
know corporations

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:84%
do not want us coming out
with these advancements

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that quickly because
they'll lose the money.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Or, if we do come out
with them, they'll use it

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and you don't get
to save the money.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.660 align:middle line:84%
The end user, as far as
we are all concerned here,

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:90%
we don't get it.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Yeah.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:90%
We do not benefit.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:84%
The benefit is doled out
like you would feed the dog.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.832 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: And who is that?

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Who do you think that--

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Well, I think it's
an amalgamation of a mindset.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that, once you
reach a certain point

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.250 align:middle line:84%
in the corporate
structure, and--

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:90%
what do we say?

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:84%
You get so many
followers or something.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.910 align:middle line:84%
But once you have so
many people involved,

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.630 align:middle line:84%
for you to become disruptive
is to hurt yourself.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:90%
And corporations won't do that.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.488 align:middle line:90%
They're not interested.

00:12:53.488 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that people go, well,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
how come this technology
is not available?

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's very simple.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.620 align:middle line:84%
People would come
and say, well, I

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.703 align:middle line:90%
would like one of these devices.

00:13:02.703 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, there's
only one or two.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:90%
We have prototypes.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.135 align:middle line:84%
And they go, well,
release it to the world.

00:13:08.135 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:90%
I love that language.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we release
it to the world?

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, right.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.600 align:middle line:90%
I get that a lot.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: And here's a
quarter million dollars.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, OK.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I've got $100 million
in unfunded research

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:90%
and development.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:90%
I need about--

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:84%
General Motors
spent $3.5 billion

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
to develop five plants
to develop cars.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And you want me
to produce devices

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that Westinghouse used
to, or anybody else--

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.600 align:middle line:84%
General Electric-- the
infrastructure to develop that

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:90%
is phenomenal.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to stand up tomorrow
and go into the New York Stock

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:90%
Exchange.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.865 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I have
a company that

00:13:41.865 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to reduce
energetic needs of any kind

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:90%
of electrical devices by 80%.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And then all I need
is about $300 million

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:90%
to bring it to market.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:90%
And they go, who are you?

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you go, well, I'm
one of those fringe people.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And I've built the
thing, but I don't

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.330 align:middle line:84%
have the academic
background that you

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:90%
would accept to make it valid.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they control it.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.112 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's so true.

00:14:11.112 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: And it's sad.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It is.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:90%
It's very sad.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And we've both
been through that.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Oh, yeah.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Many times.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:23.680 align:middle line:84%
But getting back to
the UFOs, the crafts,

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:84%
this falls into
this type of energy.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:84%
They're working
off of this energy

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.780 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about here.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And the disclosure of that, I
think the audience should know,

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:84%
if we do disclose
anti-gravitic craft,

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
or if the craft that we have
found gets to the surface

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and we show everyone, the first
thing that they're going to ask

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:90%
is, how did it get here?

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:90%
What propulsion units?

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it wasn't gas,
coal, and oil, right?

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you're
proving that existence.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.332 align:middle line:84%
I think it'll be really
problematic for big gas, coal,

00:15:01.332 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and oil, because we're not
going to need it anymore, right?

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Well, at
a certain level,

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:90%
we don't need it right now.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.430 align:middle line:90%
We don't need it.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Yeah.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:84%
The technology out
there right now is--

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
everything could
be converted over.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:90%
What's the ramifications that?

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:84%
You would basically
destroy the US economy

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:84%
during the switchover for a
period of about four years.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's going to be ugly.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
There is a vested interest in
not giving out the technology

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.390 align:middle line:90%
too fast or too much.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: But if they
were to disclose the ET,

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.365 align:middle line:84%
UFO phenomena tomorrow,
they could do it slowly,

00:15:44.365 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:90%
couldn't they?

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Yes.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.943 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why couldn't-- it
should be a choice that they

00:15:47.943 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Well, that would
be a free and open society.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:90%
So the answer is yes.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:90%
That technology exists.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't-- well, now we
have the fiduciary interest.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.703 align:middle line:84%
And the ideal of, how
can I make money on it,

00:16:02.703 --> 00:16:04.120 align:middle line:84%
as supposed to,
well, here you go.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Of course.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Here's a solar
cell, or here's something else

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:90%
to that effect.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.190 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:84%
The problem becomes that the
questions that you need to ask,

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:84%
or that will be asked,
become unanswerable

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.240 align:middle line:84%
by our current
socioeconomic model.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the answer.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knows how to fix it.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows how to advance
it, to introduce new subjects,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:90%
new ideals like that.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:84%
If I introduced a cure
for cancer tomorrow,

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.785 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably be shot, because
there's so much money involved.

00:16:37.785 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:84%
People don't want
to accept that.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:84%
They think, well, it's
a conspiracy theory.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, try this one.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Every society in the world,
in the last 2,000 years,

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:90%
has had a treatment for cancer.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But you're not allowed
to practice those.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:84%
If you come up with
a sterling engine,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.860 align:middle line:84%
you come up with a
Tesla-type engine,

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not allowed
to present that to the world

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.770 align:middle line:84%
because it would
be too disruptive.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And you go, well, who
says it's too disruptive?

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, I think it's
more of a-- there's

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:14.560 align:middle line:84%
this suppression that exists
by virtue of self-benefit.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.579 align:middle line:84%
Once you toss self-benefit
out the window, then the idea

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.890 align:middle line:90%
you would benefit everyone.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that's
called free and open society,

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.359 align:middle line:84%
where everybody is able to
develop that and present it

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:84%
to society and see
if they want it.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you went
out today and said,

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:84%
hey, all of the religions
in the world that

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
have existed up to this
point, which is about 4,600

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:90%
or something--

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and now we have information
that invalidates that.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:90%
And they don't want that.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we would go, well, why
does it need to invalidate it?

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:90%
You can believe what you want.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like, you can
go to the doctor you want.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.940 align:middle line:84%
You can have whatever
belief system you want.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But don't deny what's
available because it conflicts

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:90%
with your belief system.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And then we see
information slowly dripping out

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and we think we're
getting somewhere,

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and then they cover it up with
some other disinformation.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And then they cover that
up with disinformation.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Then we all get
confused with what's

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:90%
really going on out there.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But what is that
distraction about?

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Well, it's
called deflection.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I get on
the path of pursuit

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.760 align:middle line:84%
of a certain body
of information,

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:90%
or knowledge, or technology.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And if I can deflect
you, if I can create

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.690 align:middle line:90%
a financial issue for you--

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:38.680 align:middle line:84%
economic-- if I can create
a health hazard for you,

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
if I can give you a cold, if
you ask how I would do it--

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
how would you like to have a
cold for two months, chemically

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:90%
induced?

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.890 align:middle line:84%
How would you like to have
your finances disrupted?

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:84%
How would you like to
get a speeding ticket,

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.927 align:middle line:84%
and you weren't
even in that state?

00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.135 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of things where

00:18:59.135 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:90%
I throw you off your game.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I do that, I'm
just slowing you down.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I think the problem occurs in
that sequestering and denial

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
of information and advancement
is to slow it all down.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the only point.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Because it is going to come out.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:84%
The information density,
again, of all these things

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:90%
is becoming too great.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like trying to
stop the holes in the dyke.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.830 align:middle line:84%
It becomes impossible,
at a certain point.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And they basically tear the wall
down and say, OK, there you go.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, wait,
everybody back up.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.252 align:middle line:84%
For 30 years, there's been
a freaking wall there,

00:19:39.252 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and now you're telling
me, oh, it's no problem.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.440 align:middle line:90%
You can go back and forth.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.540 align:middle line:90%
We've experienced that.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Think about that from
a technological aspect.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:90%
Now we can go there.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So people that want
to advance all this,

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
jump in and do your own
research, and pick a project,

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.993 align:middle line:90%
and have at it.

00:19:55.993 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And what you're going
to do is spend your time

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and spend your money.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people,
don't bankrupt yourself

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.210 align:middle line:90%
like we've done several times.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:90%
But you'll have hits and misses.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like the devices
in North Carolina

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
we looked at, and in
Florida, and in Virginia.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.640 align:middle line:90%
And those didn't work.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:90%
It was just a scam.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Now you have somebody
coming in and going,

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.130 align:middle line:84%
oh, yeah, I know how to do
this, and here's my device.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't work.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just, give me a
whole lot of money.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done
is taken money out

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:84%
of the pool that would have
been available to people

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.010 align:middle line:90%
who would have done it.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we see
in cancer research and--

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like I said, a lot of
technologies are out there.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.757 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are the budgets
greater for suppression than

00:20:34.757 --> 00:20:35.590 align:middle line:90%
the actual research?

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Uh-huh.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how
we get to today.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, we have a conundrum.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, we have a problem.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.120 align:middle line:84%
The sequestering budget
has become so big that

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:84%
they've short-changed
the development side--

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
the research and
development side.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Research and development
is raising hell about it.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
They want to bring
out the technology.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:90%
And this is any corporation.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Any R&D department wants to
bring out what they know.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.900 align:middle line:84%
They're excited about
what they found out.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the legal,
and the financial, and everybody

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.720 align:middle line:90%
goes, no, we decide.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:90%
We decide when that technology.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:18.150 align:middle line:84%
When I was at Edwards,
back in the '70s,

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
the planes I was
looking at out there,

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and the flight technology,
it's like, 10 years ago, I

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.110 align:middle line:90%
finally saw one of those.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people,
you think in 40 years,

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:90%
there's been no advancement?

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:10%
The SR-71 was supposedly
built in 112 days--

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:10%
or 104 days,
something like that--

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:10%
from start to finish.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I can tell a lot
of whoppers, too.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:84%
But that's the first
example of a technology

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:84%
coming into existence where
there weren't any stops.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anybody
saying, we can't do this,

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:90%
or you shouldn't do this.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:84%
But look how long it took
to reveal that technology--

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:90%
30 years, 40 years?

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.490 align:middle line:90%
And here we are again.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
We sell planes to the Saudis,
and all around the world,

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and go, this is the latest,
greatest jet fighter.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Remember the cell phones?

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Where's iteration
42, 3, 4, 5, 6?

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:90%
You think those don't exist?

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:84%
That R&D budget, now we know
why the federal deficit,

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:84%
or why all these corporations--
because if you did forensic

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:84%
accounting on some of
these corporations,

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:90%
on JPL and General Dynamics--

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I go to Rand
Corporation on Hughes Air.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.540 align:middle line:84%
It would-- first of all,
you would never get anywhere

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:84%
with it, because
they would never

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.935 align:middle line:90%
want that knowledge known.

00:22:42.935 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Randy, why do
you think there's been more

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:84%
disclosure drips over the
past couple of years than ever

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:90%
before?

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: If you think
about suppressing technology

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and the effort required, and
you look at the expansion

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.710 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge in the last
30 years, last 20 years,

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:84%
last 10 years, and then just the
last 5, forget about doubling.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:84%
It's off the freaking
charts as far

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.648 align:middle line:84%
as how much knowledge
is coming into play.

00:23:12.648 --> 00:23:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about trying to hold

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:84%
that knowledge in the dark,
you can't do it anymore.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's no
choice but disclosure.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.757 align:middle line:90%
There's no choice at all.

00:23:23.757 --> 00:23:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You don't believe the
government will have some huge

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.570 align:middle line:90%
disclosure event?

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: No.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- you're looking
in the wrong place.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:32.895 align:middle line:90%
I don't see that happening.

00:23:32.895 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: No.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.990 align:middle line:84%
The diffusion of
that information

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:84%
is what we say
across the boards.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:90%
We have some.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.670 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese have some.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.860 align:middle line:90%
England has some.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.530 align:middle line:90%
AI development.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Oh, United States, IBM, and
all of these people, DU5 wave.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:90%
England has an AI program.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.630 align:middle line:90%
China has an AI program.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Hong Kong does, Taiwan.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the place.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And when the cat's out of the
bag, when somebody actually

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:07.800 align:middle line:84%
gets to the event,
then everybody's

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:84%
going to jump in and
go, oh, yeah, me too.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.710 align:middle line:90%
We've done that.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And up until that event
happens, everybody

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:18.840 align:middle line:84%
goes, oh, no, we don't
know anything about this.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're back to, when the
aliens land on the White House

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.730 align:middle line:84%
lawn, everybody goes,
oh, yeah, I knew that.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I think they're up
against the wall.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that we already
have disclosure.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just that this narrative
of wanting other people

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:90%
to verify it is ridiculous.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:90%
I've seen UFOs.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.043 align:middle line:90%
Have you?

00:24:39.043 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: A few, in my time.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Uh-huh.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can deny that.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.520 align:middle line:84%
They can make fun of you
for having seen them.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But the reality
is, I've seen them.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:48.960 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It's something that doesn't
need to be verified.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.240 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need to have
a certificate from the US

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:84%
government that said
I did or did not.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.030 align:middle line:90%
That's just wrong.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Now we say we have a
group of enthusiasts--

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.200 align:middle line:90%
UFO enthusiasts.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.610 align:middle line:84%
We had a cult, but
now we're enthusiasts.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.642 align:middle line:90%
So there's some advancement.

00:25:08.642 --> 00:25:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, why do you
think the government now is kind

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:90%
of entertaining it?

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just not
a couple of people.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.300 align:middle line:84%
You have them making statements
about, the Navy is allowed to,

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and pilots are now allowed
to report these things.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Which is sad, to know that
they've kind of admitted

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:28.140 align:middle line:90%
that they weren't allowed to.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.750 align:middle line:90%
The corporations, that is.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.740 align:middle line:90%
And now it's OK.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: OK.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the US
government and say,

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:84%
tell me about UFOs, who
is going to respond?

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Who has the-- what
do you call it?

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.665 align:middle line:90%
There is a policy.

00:25:46.665 --> 00:25:47.915 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember the language.

00:25:47.915 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: No, I know
what you're saying.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: I have the
ability to respond to that.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:52.960 align:middle line:90%
And you see it in our poli--

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:90%
I cannot respond to that.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: "I can neither
confirm or deny."

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:90%
We hear all that.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Here's the deal.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, when those
crafts were first found--

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:90%
if there were any--

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:84%
the general in the Army
picked up the debris,

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:90%
or picked up the--

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The aluminum
foil and stuff.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Yeah.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.980 align:middle line:84%
They picked up the
game, we'll call it.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Where did they transfer it?

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:84%
They transferred it to the
Navy up in Illinois or Indiana.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:84%
The Office of Naval
Intelligence is

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:90%
who you would ask about UFOs.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's it.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you think
ONI is going to go,

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:39.400 align:middle line:84%
well, hey, Emery,
I'm glad you asked.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.200 align:middle line:90%
NDA.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.790 align:middle line:84%
You're not entitled
to that information.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:42.707 align:middle line:90%
You don't have access.

00:26:42.707 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:90%
That's a secret access program.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:90%
That's a CIA--

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, ugh, right?

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to tell you.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And we go, well,
I'm not authorized

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.980 align:middle line:90%
to tell you-- if I was them.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we go, well,
who is authorized?

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And there you go to
the pure existence

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:90%
of black holes in the universe.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Try that door over there.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.820 align:middle line:90%
No, that one.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And you just get
the whole runaround.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Yeah.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.360 align:middle line:84%
ONI became the repository
of that information,

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.640 align:middle line:90%
that research, that development.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you have DARPA
coming into existence, ARPA

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:16.620 align:middle line:90%
DARPA.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a whole
group of vested interest

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:84%
in maintaining a smooth
flow, a non-disruptive,

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.320 align:middle line:90%
an even society.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.820 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't work for humans.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:84%
We're much more geared to these
huge leaps of advancement.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And you have not seen
them in the last 30 years.
