00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:08.347 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.347 --> 00:00:19.827 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.827 --> 00:00:22.160 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: We are told
that the center of the Earth

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.300 align:middle line:10%
has a very hot, fiery core
surrounded by a mantle.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:84%
But what if there happens
to be an entire ecosystem,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:84%
unknown to us, right
under our feet?

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:10%
And with us today
is Emery Smith,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:10%
who is going to tell us
about the Inner Earth.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.577 align:middle line:90%
Because you've been there.

00:00:38.577 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.702 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good to have you, too.

00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
How far down did you
go into the planet?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I really
don't know exactly.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:84%
They never really
kind of told us that.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.383 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you feel heat,
or anything like that?

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, I was
never overheated.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:84%
It was very actually
a constant 55 degrees,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:84%
or in some of the civilization--
the actual ecosystems

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:90%
were around 80 degrees.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:90%
So they were warm.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Because I think these
systems, the way

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.020 align:middle line:84%
they're allowed to flourish is
some of those veins of magma,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, are surrounding
them and keeping it just

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:84%
at the right specific
temperature for life

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:90%
to flourish down there.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you see oceans?

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've seen giant
lakes, but not oceans.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Underwater, or
underground, you saw lakes.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've seen saltwater
lakes and freshwater lakes.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
There was lots of
light, everywhere.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of light
emitting plants and animals.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And the moisture in the
air, like I told you,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:84%
or in other episodes,
is bio luminescent.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Just the floating
water particles

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
have some sort of chemical in
them that it's always lit up.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Now there was a time I
saw a rainbow atmosphere

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:84%
in one of these places,
a very bright light.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's like the top
of the ceiling it looks like.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, don't you have
to have like a little star sun

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:90%
in order to have a rainbow?

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, they fit-- right.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:84%
This is what-- it was a prism
effect is what they figured.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:90%
They figured this out.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it casted
this rainbow-like light

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
across the top of
this humongous cavern.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it looks
like it's infinity.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So what they found out
was there was somehow

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:84%
a ball of this water that
was anti-gravitic that

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
was just up, way up
high in this area

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that the light that was around
was making this effect going

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:90%
through it.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:02:48.385 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Now you and your team
went into the Inner Earth.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
What was the mission and
how did you get there?

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we used
portal technology.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.848 align:middle line:84%
And there would be anywhere from
10 to 15 people in the group.

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you get
into the Inner Earth,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.598 align:middle line:90%
how do you move around?

00:03:05.598 --> 00:03:06.398 align:middle line:90%
Do you walk?

00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you drive?

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, we basically
hiked the whole way.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.255 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's all--

00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All on foot.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.005 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: All on foot.

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of these
places are so vast,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
there are many,
many, many miles.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I know that one of the
longest ones I remember

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:90%
was about six miles in diameter.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty hefty.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah,
everything's on foot.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
We do have assistants with
special types of robots

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and other cybernetic
type of beings.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't give
you like a golf cart,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
something like that,
just to move around?

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.435 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the
whole thing is also--

00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too jaggedy?

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --you don't want
to damage and ruin any--

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to leave a
trace behind, you know.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like going
into a national park.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:90%
Pack in and pack everything out.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Don't leave a candy wrapper.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it could have
a detrimental effect

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
the Earth if we

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:90%
were to leave something behind.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So we try to lightly,
what we call, tread

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
lightly on everything
there, because we don't want

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.912 align:middle line:90%
to affect it and mess it up.

00:04:15.912 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
was the mission?

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:84%
What did they want
you guys to do?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:90%
And women, of course.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I was
a medic, number one.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And also was a person that
if they found something

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
that was related to
extraterrestrial technology,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I was to extract it in a
sterile fashion and put it in--

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
we have a special protocol
of how we take specimens

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:90%
so we don't contaminate them.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're in suits
and things like this,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.690 align:middle line:84%
you have to be very careful
when collecting anything.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Because you might walk
up to something, grab it,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.165 align:middle line:84%
and it squirts
something out at you

00:05:01.165 --> 00:05:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and eats right
through your suit.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.123 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could be
acidic or something.

00:05:04.123 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Or gaseous, too.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
There's certain gases
that can permeate.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could be a defense
mechanism of an animal, right?

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So we're dealing with a
whole 'nother species of life

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:90%
that we're not familiar with.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's very dangerous.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's very rare, we usually
have one security person there.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Mostly everyone there is trained
in basic first aid and EMT

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.390 align:middle line:90%
And we have--

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to take
care of each other.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we have, of
course, physicians

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and paramedics and people that
are special geologists that

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
know what kind of
rocks and minerals

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and crystals, lots of
crystals are down there.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did everybody
have a specific purpose?

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.267 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, everyone
had a specific purpose.

00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Some people were teamed
up, too, as twos.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Everyone
was always monitored.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Everyone kind of always
knew where everyone was.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:84%
But you could actually
walk a mile or two

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:84%
in these areas, these jungles
and these lakes and things

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And in some lakes, you
would have to be careful

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:90%
because they are very acidic.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.242 align:middle line:84%
So you couldn't
just go in there.

00:06:18.242 --> 00:06:19.200 align:middle line:90%
You'd probably burn up.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would eat you away.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.133 align:middle line:90%
And melt right down.

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:23.508 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
what's the worst

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.573 align:middle line:84%
thing you've seen there
that may have happened

00:06:25.573 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:90%
to one of your crew members?

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Did anybody die?

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Only
things I've seen are

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:84%
the videos from past
adventurers that

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:90%
have went into these things.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they showed
you videos of some of it.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:39.910 align:middle line:90%
We-- many, many.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Before even going
into a mission,

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:84%
you get to see all
the prior missions.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.180 align:middle line:84%
It's part of your training,
so you know what to expect,

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:84%
you know what trees not
to touch, what animals not

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.962 align:middle line:90%
to touch, when to run.

00:06:54.962 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is then
the most horrendous thing

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.880 align:middle line:90%
you've seen on video?

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.040 align:middle line:90%
What did you see?

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.328 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It probably was
the lake was pretty bad.

00:07:01.328 --> 00:07:02.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody
jumped in there?

00:07:02.745 --> 00:07:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.637 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You sound
emotional here.

00:07:04.637 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they just
touched it with their foot--

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And lost the foot?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:90%
It just like ate it away.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it was like acid.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Didn't make it.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you saw this
on video or you were there?

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Just on video.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now prior to
your first mission,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:84%
did you go through a
special training program

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:90%
to get ready for this mission?

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, most
people that are traveling

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:84%
on the Inner Earth have
already done off-planet stuff

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:90%
with portals.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As you had done.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have already
done that before you

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:90%
go to Inner Earth.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Because it's actually more
dangerous in the Inner Earth

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:84%
than it is going somewhere
else off planet, to be honest.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have more information,
too, about Inner Earth--

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.932 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Outer Earth
than we do Inner Earth.

00:07:51.932 --> 00:07:54.307 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, we don't even
know our own planet, really.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.530 align:middle line:90%
So by going through mock--

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.830 align:middle line:84%
we actually will do mock
trainings, where we'll suit up

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and they might drop us off
in the Bisti Badlands in New

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Mexico for a couple days
and say, go, survive, and do

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle line:90%
this and collect these things.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Or remote areas of the desert.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:84%
We did a lot of practicing
in the White Sands National

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Monument Park there.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like exciting
and fun at the same time.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:90%
No, it was a very exciting time.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And then my first time,
you have levels of people.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So you might have been
already there 15 times.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.009 align:middle line:90%
So you're the commanding leader.

00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Based on the experience.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Based on the
experience and also

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:84%
how long you've
been going there.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe the next person
only has been there 10 times.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So then they're the
second in command.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So my first time I
went, I was the newbie.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:90%
So I was more--

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
the newbies have to
just follow and observe.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed
to do anything.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're prepared in
case something happens, right?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have equipment
with you and stuff like that?

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, we
have special packs.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
We have special
suits we're wearing.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:84%
The packs that you
would carry if you

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.240 align:middle line:84%
were a medic in the military,
you have epinephrine.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they tell
you, don't do anything,

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.910 align:middle line:90%
we want you to be an observer?

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.327 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah,
you're an observer.

00:09:26.327 --> 00:09:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Usually, you have a lot
of cameras with you,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
the newbies do, and
they're filming everything.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And usually, we call
them the Sherpas,

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.457 align:middle line:84%
because they carry
the most weight.

00:09:38.457 --> 00:09:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Put them to work.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We put them
to work, you know.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:84%
But very quickly,
you go up the ranks,

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:90%
once they see how you perform.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And just like any other
soldier in the military

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:84%
goes through a training to make
sure you could handle in case

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:90%
something does go really bad.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So we had to go through a
mental evaluation for all

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:90%
the missions.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And once you get
back, you have to go

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:84%
through another
mental evaluation

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you
weren't affected somehow

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.230 align:middle line:84%
or something you saw
upset you, or just

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.140 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you keep
your wits about you.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, some things
can be overwhelming.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:84%
We've had a few
soldiers that were,

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
it was just a little
bit too much for them.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not
in your reality

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
anymore, and it's hard
sometimes to accept that.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to come back to
the top of the planet here.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of nice
being down there.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people that
have done a lot of missions,

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I heard recently that they now
put limitations on missions

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:90%
because of the reality check.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On some
off-planet missions,

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:84%
you used animals and
dogs to help you.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
What about the Inner
Earth missions?

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, there
were always at least one

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.260 align:middle line:84%
or two canine units that
were with us that were also

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.120 align:middle line:90%
geared up in special suits.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And they had special helmets
that allowed them to hear,

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:84%
because they can hear
things that we cannot hear.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're trained to pick
up different frequencies,

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.697 align:middle line:84%
in case there was a, let's say,
an earthquake about to happen.

00:11:22.697 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What breed did
you have down there?

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They were
a type of mastiff.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, big size dog.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, they were
hybrid-type animals.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Depending on where we're
at and the environment

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and the atmosphere,
you know, some

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:40.010 align:middle line:84%
didn't have to wear a suit,
you know, and some did,

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:90%
depending on where we were.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:84%
They also have a greater sense
of smell and can pick up--

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.550 align:middle line:84%
they're trained to pick
up special gas odors

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
that we might not smell,
but they could smell.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So then we would have
to put our mask on.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.245 align:middle line:84%
Because we weren't
always wearing a helmet.

00:11:57.245 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like the parakeet.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we weren't we weren't
always having to wear a helmet.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So it just depends on which
place we were going to.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I get it.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Now when you said the
animals were hybrids,

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.610 align:middle line:84%
were they like
mixtures of other dog

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.850 align:middle line:90%
species or some other creature?

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They were canine
mastiffs that were enhanced,

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:90%
like a super soldier.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:90%
So they were--

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Enhanced with what?

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: With special DNA.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:90%
DNA from un-Earth origin.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did
that come from?

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, with the DNA that
we would collect all the time,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:84%
we can also take proteins
and make recombinant proteins

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and things like this and we
can actually duplicate DNA.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually
make things with DNA.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You people were
doing things that are really

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:90%
off this planet, aren't they?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very
exciting, fun time.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And my first two times, I
was in complete amazement.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.623 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It must have been
amazing to look around there.

00:13:01.623 --> 00:13:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was just to be
there and to look up at the sky

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and see creatures you've
never seen before--

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what do you
mean, look up at the sky?

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the inner
planet, what do you mean?

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There is an
actual atmosphere.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It has an inner sky?

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It has an inner
sky, like a real atmosphere.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And it could be many
different colors, depending

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:90%
on the gases that are there.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You sure
you're not looking

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.028 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the
roof of a planet

00:13:31.028 --> 00:13:32.070 align:middle line:90%
or something, our planet?

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it looks
very dome-ish like.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Cause you can't see--

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.708 align:middle line:84%
you're not looking up
and seeing a cave rock.

00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's it.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm picturing you're
in a cavern somewhere.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:84%
You're saying you're
in a different area.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:90%
It's the climate.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It has its own climate,
its own atmosphere.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:90%
It makes its own oxygen.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's almost like
a planet within a planet.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It is.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like its own ecosystem, its
own planet, with its own rules,

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.020 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Since you were there and
you've witnessed these things--

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:90%
how many times were you there?

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: My first two
times, we don't count.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
you're in training.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because
you're training.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.230 align:middle line:90%
And I went maybe 20, 22 times.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't go down
there 22 times, Emery, just

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:90%
to observe plants and animals.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They weren't all to the
same place each time, George.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.770 align:middle line:84%
They were different
places that you would go.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And we were investigating
these other beings that

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:84%
were down there and
seeing if they could be

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:90%
a problem in the future, maybe.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were doing
some observations.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:84%
We weren't hurting any anyone
or kidnapping anything.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
But we did come upon, like
I said, carcasses of beings

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.630 align:middle line:84%
that we would harvest
these samples of tissue

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.412 align:middle line:84%
and bring them
back and study it.

00:15:00.412 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean to tell
me that you folks went down

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:84%
there-- you,
especially, 22 times--

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't take one
of these little creatures

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:84%
or one of these
animals or a plant.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We did set many
traps for the animals

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and the different life
beings that were down there.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.640 align:middle line:90%
And we did take those back, yes.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.052 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are probably
alive today, a little creature

00:15:26.052 --> 00:15:27.010 align:middle line:90%
in some cage somewhere.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I'm sure, 100%.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, they're
still doing it.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, this is
an ongoing project.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these
things communicate?

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what does the
little creature sound like?

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's many different
types of creatures,

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
just like there's many
different types of creatures

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:90%
on top of the Earth.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:90%
So think about--

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.773 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But these are more
human than animal, you said.

00:15:45.773 --> 00:15:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, they are.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're more conscious.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:90%
You know, animals are conscious.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:57.923 align:middle line:84%
But these creatures are more
communicative, I'll say.

00:15:57.923 --> 00:15:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they talk?

00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They do--

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even if they
have their own language?

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Some have
telepathy, yes.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:02.883 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:02.883 --> 00:16:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --speak with telepathy?

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, telepathy
is a type of language

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.250 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrials
and all of us

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:90%
will be using in the future.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
It's an actual language
that has to do with emotion.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like I'm
saying, in my mind, George.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're not
hearing my voice.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:21.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:21.375 --> 00:16:22.270 align:middle line:90%
I felt that.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You're not
hearing my voice,

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:84%
you just, you know
already what I said.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you interact
with any of these creatures?

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
friendly to you?

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, they
were very friendly.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Very confused, of
course, being captured.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Some of these were very small--

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.312 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they afraid?

00:16:41.312 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --elephant-looking
creatures.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Some were like, not primates,
but more like a bat,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:90%
like kind of a bat.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They had wings?

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, many had wings.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.830 align:middle line:84%
They obviously can take
care of themselves.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's very clear.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
But they had other abilities
that we could not understand

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:90%
and that we were frightened of.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:13.210 align:middle line:84%
If someone, if an animal can
look at you and say something

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually
communicate with it,

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and also has spikes
coming out of its

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.620 align:middle line:84%
back that have
deadly poison on it--

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Be careful.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.425 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Are you
going to hurt me?

00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about this interaction

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.910 align:middle line:84%
with the human-type
looking creatures.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:90%
What was that like for you?

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We really tried
not to interact with them.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But they really paid
no attention to us

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:84%
once they did see
us and find us,

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.700 align:middle line:84%
when we were doing
our covert operations.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle line:84%
We tried to
communicate with them,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:84%
but nothing ever
transpired through that.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
kind of looking

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:84%
at us like, who are
you, what are you

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:90%
doing here kind of thing.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were there many?

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.125 align:middle line:84%
I've only seen maybe
five or six to a group.

00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
afraid of you?

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They were small and
white and about four feet tall.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long is their hair?

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They didn't
have any hair.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.218 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No hair, bald.

00:18:11.218 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, they were
completely naked and bald.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big eyes?

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Very large
oval eyes, yes.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.780 align:middle line:90%
We never saw one by itself.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.120 align:middle line:84%
They were always in like
a little pack of four,

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.660 align:middle line:90%
five, six of them.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.590 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't speak or make
noises or anything like that.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
run away from you?

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, a few times, yes.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more like the
flight or fight mode, you know.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.288 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:18:36.288 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:90%
You going to stand your ground?

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:90%
You gonna run?

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I think they have
this ability because they're

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:84%
conscious and they
want to survive,

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and they probably
remind me of maybe

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
how we started out a
long, long, long time ago.

>>NOORY: Did they have weapons?

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, they never
carried anything like that.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't wear
any clothing, either.

witnessed these things,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:90%

We have already seen videos,
number one, of prior missions.

And this was something
that we may or may not see.

not to engage

engage if they come up to us.

have done something.

talking, when I was there,

there almost on a daily basis?

we're still going there.

not contaminate that.

something, if we're

into a commodity and sell it.

we brought back later on

did turn into devices
and things like that.

you wore, I'm trying

keeps your body either cold
or warm that you can set.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:84%
It's all AI, so you
could talk to it.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And I could say, where's George,
and it'll show me on a map

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:90%
where George is.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Great technology.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah,
amazing technology.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Depending on where
we were going,

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
we would wear air
scrubbers, depending

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.350 align:middle line:84%
on the atmosphere
of where we were at,

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:84%
maybe it was a
dusty environment.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was an
oxygen-rich environment.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:90%
It just depends on what it was.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.733 align:middle line:84%
And that's the type of
pack that you would wear.

00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was not on
your back, by the way.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It was a belt system that
all this equipment was on.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any
remarkable technologies

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:84%
that you brought to the
surface that we use now?

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think
a lot of the minerals

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and all the new textiles you
see coming out over the past 20

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:84%
years and materials,
for instance, I think

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.720 align:middle line:84%
are reverse engineered
from the Inner Earth stuff

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:90%
that they have gathered.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything
on these missions

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.710 align:middle line:84%
that you did that
you wish you did not?

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not big into killing
animals or insects and things

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:01.850 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, when I think
back about it, it's like,

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
wow, I just took this
poor salamander back away

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
from its home and who
knows what corporate's

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.830 align:middle line:84%
going to do with it,
you know what I mean?

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the insects look
different from our insects

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:90%
up here?

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yes.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:90%
They were gargantuan.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
biggest insect you had?

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The biggest,
it was like a mosquito.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:90%
And it was iridescent blue.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably at least
three to four feet in diameter.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:34.965 align:middle line:90%
Mosquito looking?

00:22:34.965 --> 00:22:35.765 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:22:35.765 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's frightening.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it had two
giant prongs that came out

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:90%
of its face, like huge prongs.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it ever
attack somebody?

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:44.588 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It can, yes.

00:22:44.588 --> 00:22:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
didn't witness that?

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I've never seen it, no.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would suck
the blood out of somebody.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't know
what it would do.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or whatever it does.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:51.887 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I don't know.

00:22:51.887 --> 00:22:54.478 align:middle line:84%
It might just be also
a mating thing for--

00:22:54.478 --> 00:22:56.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you see these
things flying around down

00:22:56.645 --> 00:22:56.870 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.036 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:22:57.036 --> 00:22:57.955 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:22:57.955 --> 00:22:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
captured one of those?

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, we did.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it go crazy?

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Anything that we capture
usually, if it's not--

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
if we don't anesthetize
it, most of the stuff

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:84%
is easily anesthetized
and then we approach it.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you-- you
don't catch it with a net.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Actually, we
do use special nets.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:29.370 align:middle line:84%
We have these special cubes
that we just put on the ground

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:90%
and we activate them.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And anything that
comes near it, it

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:84%
shoots out this jello spider
net, up to sometimes 30,

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:90%
40 feet.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just engulfs it.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.853 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it engulfs
it and brings it in.

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
thing's flapping around.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well no, the gel-like
substance in this cube

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.252 align:middle line:90%
anesthetizes it immediately.

00:23:50.252 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then you
just carry it away?

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's an animal
or an insect or whatever.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then where do
you put it when you come

00:23:56.905 --> 00:23:58.420 align:middle line:90%
to the planet, to the surface?

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, we have special
containers that's there.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:08.400 align:middle line:84%
We have special robotic
units that are assisting us.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we even have a type
of cybernetic dogs and things

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:84%
like this that come with us
and would help carry the loads.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you do
with the specimens here?

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't know what
they do with the specimens.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.200 align:middle line:84%
That was not part
of my position.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I was there for basically
categorizing what type

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.310 align:middle line:90%
of species this might be.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Is it extraterrestrial
or was it, is it

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.215 align:middle line:84%
something that we already
have here on planet Earth?

00:24:41.215 --> 00:24:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: If we did come across--

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:51.720 align:middle line:84%
which we did come across many
times archaeological tablets

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and things that had unique
writings and things like this

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:57.470 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.928 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
morph at all, when

00:24:58.928 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:90%
you bring them to the surface?

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Do they change
into anything else?

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, they can.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Some can actually just
completely disintegrate.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But I've never seen one turn
into something else, no.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand,
when we bring them back,

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:84%
they're in a special
vacuumed container.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's like bringing the being
back in the same atmosphere

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.360 align:middle line:90%
that we've captured it in.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:84%
There's many places, there's
underground facilities

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:84%
where they're trying to
recreate the exact atmosphere

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.175 align:middle line:90%
and the exact environment.

00:25:37.175 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you do
with a three-foot mosquito,

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:39.760 align:middle line:90%
for crying out loud?

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, that's
what I'm saying.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
They let them go in
these man-made habitats,

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:84%
these habitat zoos
that are underground,

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to reproduce
these creatures to see if they

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.190 align:middle line:84%
can mate and if we can
actually have them--

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they mate?

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, Yes.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:90%
Many, yeah.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
There's actually these fake
environmental ecosystems

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that we made, giant spheres
under the ground that

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:84%
are vacuum sealed
and duplicating

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.870 align:middle line:84%
the exact atmosphere
of these other places.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you find
technology down there?

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, we found some
technology that we do believe

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.790 align:middle line:90%
is extraterrestrial.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.413 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And can you relate
to us what it might have been?

00:26:27.413 --> 00:26:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: A lot of
it, I think, was

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:33.210 align:middle line:84%
measuring equipment of some sort
and maybe a couple of weapons.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.800 align:middle line:90%


00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't allowed to be--

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.100 align:middle line:84%
it's so compartmentalized,
George, you have to understand.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
If my job is to pick this
thing up in a sterile fashion,

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.540 align:middle line:90%
vacuum seal it, and take it in.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then I'm out
of that compartment now,

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and some other scientist
is going to work on that.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
aware of technologies,

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.318 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know
what we took back.

00:26:57.318 --> 00:26:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm making
my own opinion up

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:84%
because of what I have
worked with personally

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.140 align:middle line:84%
on real extraterrestrial
equipment.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So I could-- and that's why I
was on a lot these missions.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I could say, hey,
I've seen that writing before

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:84%
from this other craft, or I've
seen the shape of this spear

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:90%
before on another being.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So then we know
that there's been

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.470 align:middle line:84%
visitations to these areas,
obviously, before us.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any idea where
the craft came from,

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.130 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what planetary
system or dimension?

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it just
depends on the type

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:90%
of craft, number one.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:84%
We have a database of
craft that have fallen here

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.260 align:middle line:84%
or that we've shot down or that
we have collected in space.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah, we must
have a list of everything.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it has certain
characteristics of this star

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.720 align:middle line:90%
system or that star system.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems like
it was more dangerous

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.600 align:middle line:84%
doing Inner Earth missions
than off-planet missions.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.710 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we
know more, like I

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:84%
said, about off-planet
missions, because we've

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:84%
been traveling
there a lot longer

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:90%
than we have Inner Earth.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Inner Earth's more of
the new traveling system.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.413 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you were into
unknown territory, hence

00:28:19.413 --> 00:28:20.330 align:middle line:90%
it was more dangerous?

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Very unknown.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything seems to have
a mechanism for surviving

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.170 align:middle line:90%
there, even a blade of grass.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be very
careful what you step on.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.320 align:middle line:84%
You have to be very aware
of your surroundings.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.520 align:middle line:84%
We have special radar that
these little robots that

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.000 align:middle line:84%
come with us that communicate
with us saying, hey, there's

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:84%
something in the air
above you, be alert.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is always
watching everyone's back,

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.020 align:middle line:84%
because it can get into a
very, very bad situation

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:58.950 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say is the greatest

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:84%
piece of information
that you were

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.280 align:middle line:90%
able to bring back with you?

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That there's more
life out there than we

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.790 align:middle line:90%
could have ever imagined.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And not just out
there, but inner.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:20.350 align:middle line:84%
To know that there's
other places in the future

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.800 align:middle line:84%
that we'll be able to
visit and other places

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:28.840 align:middle line:84%
to learn things that
could probably help us,

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.960 align:middle line:84%
help the Earth, help
clean up the Earth.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Because they already got it
mastered, for some reason.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Why are their places so perfect?

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't have cars
running around with gas.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.812 align:middle line:84%
And they're not burning
fires or anything.

00:29:43.812 --> 00:29:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think they have
more respect for the planet

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.500 align:middle line:90%
than we do?

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:53.560 align:middle line:84%
From witnessing their
actions and things,

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
definitely a higher state

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:01.117 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness of protecting.

00:30:01.117 --> 00:30:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Emery, thanks for
sharing your expertise again.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Thanks for
having me, George.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
watching the program.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.110 align:middle line:90%
