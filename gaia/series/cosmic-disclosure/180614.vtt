[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.500 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.260 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host George Noory
and I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And we will be
talking about space

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:90%
salvaging in this episode.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.227 align:middle line:84%
Emery, welcome back to
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Hi, George.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.172 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What the heck
is space salvaging?

00:00:35.172 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, just like
we have ships out here

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle line:10%
in the ocean that
salvage wreckages,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:10%
there is a huge event going on
in atmosphere and exoatmosphere

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:10%
in our surrounding solar system.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And what that is, is the
constant daily activity

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.150 align:middle line:84%
of craft going up and
salvaging space junk.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And not just
space junk that we

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.600 align:middle line:84%
have put up there,
but space junk that

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:84%
has been here for millions of
years of downed craft, bodies,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:90%
devices.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who's going
up there taking it?

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.986 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We're going
up there collecting

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:90%
it, the human civilization.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:84%
The corporations have contracted
out major rocket entities

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:90%
to send up these craft.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Now there are space
stations up there

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:84%
already with these
technicians and mechanics

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:90%
that are up there all the time.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And they are collecting
this material

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and putting it on these capsules
and sending it back down

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
to Earth where we retrieve
them from the ocean

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:84%
and take it back
to our laboratories

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and study whether it's fibers or
metals or composites or bodies

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's space
junk though, isn't it?

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Space junk,
just like junk here,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
still can be used, recycled,
and we can learn from it.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of this
stuff is not made on Earth,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:90%
it's not from Earth.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more of
that just floating around.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:84%
The whole system is
full of this space junk

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:90%
that's just floating around.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Some are craft that have
been damaged or exploded.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Old satellites
that have died, right.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.896 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, old
satellites and things

00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
like this that are not of
Earth origin, by the way.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Many drones have
been found as well

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.977 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrial
civilizations that

00:02:16.977 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
are up there that
just didn't make it.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The president
has proposed Space Force.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:84%
One of the missions
will be to continue

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle line:84%
the salvaging of satellites
that are up there.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Eventually this will just be
a civilian operated entity

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be public
and not be so clandestine.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.510 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
it's just reserved

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.219 align:middle line:84%
for the people who have the
money to collect these items

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and to come back and reverse
engineer them and use them

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:90%
for products.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole thing
with this Space Force,

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:90%
I kind of have to giggle at it.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Because that's been
already going on,

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:90%
as far as I know, since 1990.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So for them to say,
well, we need $14 billion

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is to
make this Space Force.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like the
secret NASA, you know,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
was already doing all this
stuff way back in the day.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Which regular NASA has no idea.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's just
a cover up, you know.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think what's
going on here is

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:84%
to get the American people to
support this with their tax

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
money is to say, well, now we're
going to have a Space Force.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
We have already had the
capability to launch missiles

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
from space, you know,
like I said, 20 years ago.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.530 align:middle line:84%
We already have
high powered laser

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.349 align:middle line:84%
beams to shoot down at the
Earth and shoot into space.

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, we've seen that.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's new
satellites going out

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
there that have very
high powered telescopes

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and tracking systems that
can track objects deep

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:90%
within our solar system.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So we know where every
piece of debris is

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and whether it's moving
under its own steam or not.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's been talk
that there's a satellite called

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:90%
the Black Knight satellite.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Might we be also
looking for that?

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't know
too much about that.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't study a lot of the pop
culture stuff that's online.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I just know that there
are devices like that

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:84%
out there, very large craft
that have been downed.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:84%
They're just floating
around space.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Some are in orbit around the
moon, around other planets

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:90%
nearby, around the sun.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
So they only come around
every now and then,

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:84%
but they are in some
sort of elliptical orbit.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And daily things are
coming near the Earth

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
where they can go out and
see what this giant thing is.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Is it an asteroid?

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Is it is an abandoned ship?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And they go out there
and they do the best

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:90%
to get these things.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Emery, you've
talked about space stations

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:90%
being up there.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:90%
What else is up there?

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There are
other stations that

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
are up there and stations
being built today

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
around the same size, just
a little bit different.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And these are housing
technicians and scientists

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.680 align:middle line:84%
not only for the removal
of all the salvaging,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.935 align:middle line:84%
but also to control different
types of satellites that

00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:90%
are a little bit farther away.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
satellite drones

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:84%
that can maneuver around
the solar system now--

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --that these
people are controlling.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's easier for them to
do it up there for some reason

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.414 align:middle line:90%
than to be on Earth.

00:05:08.414 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of corporations

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:84%
are involved in this
kind of work right now?

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: All the aerospace
scientific corporations.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.140 align:middle line:90%
I won't say names, but--

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.014 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But we know.

00:05:16.014 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You guys
already know them.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And they also have
sub-entities under them.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And they make sub-corporations
under these corporations

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:84%
to make it look like they're not
really with that corporation.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.069 align:middle line:84%
It just depends
on what happened.

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
space accidents that

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.080 align:middle line:90%
happen you don't hear about.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So the military will
contact these corporations

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, by the way, we had
a little malfunction up there.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind
repairing the satellite

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.245 align:middle line:90%
or getting this if you can?

00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:43.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:43.045 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They have their
own smaller space shuttles--

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.330 align:middle line:84%
they're smaller than
our space shuttle--

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
that maneuver around space
and around our atmosphere,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:90%
exoatmosphere.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:84%
There is also very
smaller versions

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:90%
of these type of like pods.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So think of like
a motorcycle pod

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
that you can go around space
just for one or two people.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
That is also in
orbit all the time

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and are docked with these
space shuttles and these space

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:90%
stations.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And we do have a very
special killer satellite

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:84%
up there that can project an
EMF wave, electromagnetic field

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:90%
disruption wave.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And knock
out a satellite?

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.618 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And totally
take a satellite out

00:06:22.618 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
within a half a second
and completely disable it.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But I also can't
understand is you

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
know, we're going to put all
these new weapons in space,

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.500 align:middle line:84%
but you know, someone
with a high powered

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
frequency pulse generator

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
could actually take
one out from here.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
They have special satellites
and radars out there that

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.010 align:middle line:84%
pick up on these types of
electromagnetic pulse bursts.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So they can basically
hone in and triangulate

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:90%
exactly where it came from.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where it came from,
but who sent it up there?

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.751 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Everything that
leaves the atmosphere on Earth

00:06:58.751 --> 00:06:59.610 align:middle line:90%
is monitored.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a corporation
or a country launching anything

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere,
that's going

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.211 align:middle line:84%
to be a high threat
satellite where they're

00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
going to monitor
that very closely

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and see what type of
frequencies it's delivering.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Also shoot it with
x-rays and you know,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
basically pick it apart
from very, very far away.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Soviet Union
set up a satellite around one

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:90%
of Mars' moons many years ago.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was a picture
of an object approaching

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.020 align:middle line:90%
that satellite.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden that
satellite went dead.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I think it was an
extraterrestrial craft.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Very possible.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Anything that leaves
our exoatmosphere that

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:84%
goes beyond that is under
strict surveillance.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And they know what
the-- you know,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.877 align:middle line:84%
they know the intention
behind these satellites.

00:07:44.877 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
They might be telling
you, oh, we just

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:84%
want to look at
the rocks on Mars.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
But really, maybe they just
want to drop a bomb on Mars

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:84%
to see and measure
the frequencies

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and you know, the atmosphere
change and things like this.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of clandestine
projects are launched

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:84%
into space and we're told it's
just for space exploration

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:90%
or this, that, or the other.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.557 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it's
some other agenda

00:08:06.557 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:84%
that they're having
that's usually negative.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do they
retrieve once they're up?

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, they have
smaller space shuttles

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:84%
which have like the
boom arms that you

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.080 align:middle line:90%
see in the old space shuttle.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Things are very
industrial, very old fashioned.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:84%
We're still using the
whole gas, coal, and oil.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And none of this
is anti-gravitic,

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:90%
as far as the space salvaging.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a very old
school, archaic way

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:84%
of going up there
still with rocket fuel,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:90%
bringing supplies up there.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:84%
That's why all these
rockets keep going up there.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.753 align:middle line:84%
These little space buggies
that I was telling you about,

00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:37.669 align:middle line:84%
the little motorcycle
things that float around

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:42.544 align:middle line:84%
have these crab-arms to get very
small objects that are located.

00:08:42.544 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:84%
And they bring that
back to the shuttle

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and they go back to
the space station.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And that constantly is just
this ongoing daily activity.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you talk
about retrieving bodies,

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.162 align:middle line:84%
what bodies are
we talking about?

00:08:54.162 --> 00:08:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's
been accidents in space.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then
a body is returned,

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:90%
a frozen body from space.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Could be a human, a
human extraterrestrial.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:84%
They weren't born on
planet Earth, I'll say.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.495 align:middle line:84%
They may have been
a hybridization.

00:09:05.495 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right, a hybridization.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Many different species have
been collected, by the way.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With human DNA?

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: With
human DNA, correct.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:84%
All extraterrestrials
have human DNA.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And they'll find
these on the radar

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and they'll go out there and
collect them, bring them back

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and send them back to
Earth in these capsules.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:84%
You're getting different
parts of fibers,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:84%
different types of
metals and things

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
like this that are
reverse engineered.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:90%
They do have full craft.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.470 align:middle line:84%
They can't bring that back
to the surface though.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too big?

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.269 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's usually too
big or they're worried

00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
about if they do send
it down of course,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.120 align:middle line:84%
it's just going to
burn up, or could it

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:90%
actually hurt somebody.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or contamination?

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.255 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Or contamination.

00:09:41.255 --> 00:09:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's possible.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So what they do is they
send these salvagers out there

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
to take apart the
craft or to document it

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.200 align:middle line:84%
and video it and learn as much
as they can, take pieces of it.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Shoot it with very
advanced radar technologies

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
to see what's inside the walls,
to see what the propulsion

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.072 align:middle line:84%
units are, these
types of things.

00:10:02.072 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you
specifically seen here, Emery?

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I have just seen
pieces of metal, weapons,

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.960 align:middle line:84%
medical devices,
bodies, parts of craft,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:84%
propulsion units from craft
that they have brought back

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:84%
to the compartmentalized
programs

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:84%
in the underground
facilities I was

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:84%
at that they had a big
storage area for this stuff.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the bodies go
into a completely different

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
things I've seen.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the most
astounding thing you've seen?

00:10:29.215 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think
the material itself.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:84%
When they do the
all the testing on

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:84%
it and it comes back of
these metals that we really

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
kind of really don't
have here on Earth

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.100 align:middle line:84%
or the mixture of certain metals
together of how they bonded

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:84%
these atoms together to
form super amazing pieces

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:84%
of material that we use today
for protection and implants

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of things.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you got more
excited about retrieved metals

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:90%
than an ET body?

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you
have to understand too,

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.385 align:middle line:84%
I'm used to seeing
bodies all the time.

00:11:02.385 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So it wasn't
like a big deal.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:84%
But to know that our whole
world can change just

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
because of a material
that can protect us,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:90%
a clear piece of metal.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.760 align:middle line:84%
They're using it in spacecraft,
they're using it in weapons,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.570 align:middle line:84%
they're using it in aircraft,
they're using it in medical.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:84%
They're using some of
this stuff, of course,

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
as far as the bodies,
pharmaceutical stuff.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So it is a reverse engineering
or trying to duplicate that.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to learn how they
did it and how they made it.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.764 align:middle line:84%
This program, you know, I
call it like the secret NASA.

00:11:35.764 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Another one calls it the
SSP and all these other pop

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:38.800 align:middle line:90%
culture terms.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's been
around for a while.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
They have very advanced
space shuttles.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.370 align:middle line:90%
They have very advanced suits.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
They're not the big,
bulky suits you see on TV

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:84%
or you know stuff you see
Neil Armstrong and Buzz

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.912 align:middle line:90%
Aldrin wearing.

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:54.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are
movable and stuff, right.

00:11:54.745 --> 00:11:56.703 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: These are very
flexible, very movable,

00:11:56.703 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:84%
very strong materials that
were reverse engineered.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:84%
The helmets can go clear
and dark electronically.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
atmosphere built into them.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:84%
You can survive in these
suits for many, many days.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:84%
As far as breathing and
urinating and defecating,

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:21.520 align:middle line:84%
all this is taken into account
for these types of suits.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a cross
between a space suit

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
that you see back in
the old days and--

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.172 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something that
a pilot would wear,

00:12:29.172 --> 00:12:30.130 align:middle line:90%
that kind of tightness?

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, not the
pressurized suit.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.566 align:middle line:84%
But do you ever see
these triathletes

00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:36.940 align:middle line:84%
when they swim
through the ocean,

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.000 align:middle line:84%
they have these big
skin suits on sometimes.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Or you see the scuba
divers going in Antarctica

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and they have the whole
headdress and everything.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So picture shrinking that big
puffy suit down to a very skin

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:50.822 align:middle line:90%
tight level.

00:12:50.822 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where you
can move around.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.738 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Where you
can move around.

00:12:53.738 --> 00:12:57.685 align:middle line:84%
It has articulated
joints everywhere.

00:12:57.685 --> 00:12:58.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Totally sealed in?

00:12:58.815 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's very ambidextrous.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:90%
It's all one piece.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And it actually zip locks
in the back of the person.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:10%
And the helmet attaches
to an aluminum frame

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:10%
that's on the collar.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.710 align:middle line:10%
It's one giant
piece of glass that

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:10%
has four segments with metal in
between the glass to separate.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's more like
four or five sided.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And inside there is
a heads up display.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.660 align:middle line:90%
And your com is in your collar.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So all the computer
stuff is in your collar

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:90%
that shoots up on your screen.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can also see
live video, which

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:90%
is transmitted from a hub.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.325 align:middle line:84%
I could actually see what you're
looking at if I wanted to.

00:13:40.325 --> 00:13:41.125 align:middle line:90%
And it's all--

00:13:41.125 --> 00:13:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You know, it
could be voice activated.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.300 align:middle line:84%
There's usually a com
that's connecting four

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:90%
or five astronauts at one time.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like in "The Matrix"
where you have that guy

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:90%
and he's on the computer.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then the people
are, you know, in the matrix.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's like kind of
communicating with them.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.373 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Controlling them.

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:01.927 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And
controlling everything.

00:14:01.927 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of like that.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:84%
There's always a big--
it's a very team effort.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:84%
It can go to hell in a hand
bag real quick up there,

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:90%
so there's a lot of protocols.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the shoes
must be self-contained too?

00:14:14.965 --> 00:14:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, the shoes are not.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not.

00:14:17.255 --> 00:14:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The gloves, shoes, and
helmet are not self-contained.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.200 align:middle line:84%
They all come on with
this very light aluminum.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:90%
They snap in and seal.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's a button on there
that actually pressurizes

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.410 align:middle line:90%
the suit once it's sealed.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's sensors
all over the suit that

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
allow them to know if there's
any type of pressure breaks

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any
leakage or anything.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.425 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And the cool
thing, the reason

00:14:37.425 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
that the feet and the helmet
and the hands are separated

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.340 align:middle line:84%
is because those are
usually the areas

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.126 align:middle line:84%
that they have problems
with lacerations

00:14:48.126 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And they automatically have
rubber seals on the inside

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:57.510 align:middle line:84%
that if there was like my
hand, let's say I cut my glove.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:84%
It immediately pressurizes
that so I don't lose pressure

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:90%
in the whole suit.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, I get.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.299 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's kind
of like a G suit,

00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:08.140 align:middle line:84%
but smaller areas
on the suit can do.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Like a G suit, pressurized
G suit for the F-16 pilots

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
things were based off

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:84%
of the plants that have
taken that were bullet proof,

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.530 align:middle line:84%
the leaves and things like
that they reverse engineered

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:90%
from the portal journeys.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And also reverse
engineered suits

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that they had contracted from
other extraterrestrials, things

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's definitely not the
same stuff that we're using.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of the things
you see on the old school space

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.710 align:middle line:84%
shuttles and the old astronaut
suits were actually--

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
maybe they were saying
it was, you know,

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:84%
this, that, or the other,
polycarbonate carbon fiber,

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.001 align:middle line:84%
I really believe a lot of
stuff was reverse engineered,

00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:51.990 align:middle line:84%
but they're not going
to tell the public that.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So these things are definitely
reverse engineered suits.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I know for a fact,
because when I

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:84%
was working with the super
suits on the terrestrial basis,

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:84%
all that stuff was reverse
engineered as well.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.812 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it was made of
graphene mixed with titanium.

00:16:10.812 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Emery, what
are the capabilities

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:84%
of our own equipment
and satellites?

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We have
satellites that can

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:84%
zoom in very, very
high definition,

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:90%
unlike anything we have.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:84%
See in so many different
light spectrums as well.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Now we can shoot into space
and see what kind of craft

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.340 align:middle line:84%
is coming in and how
many people are in there.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gees.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And the same
thing with satellites

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:90%
that are going up there.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:84%
We can actually scan these
satellite from very, very far

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:84%
away, see all the components
that are in there,

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.070 align:middle line:84%
see if they're carrying
plutonium or radioactive

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:84%
material, and have that
information within seconds

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
put right back down
to terrestrial Earth

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
so we know if it's
a threat or not.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do other countries
that have space debris up there

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.630 align:middle line:84%
go ballistic if they know
that we're taking it?

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I want you guys to
think more of corporations

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:90%
working together.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:84%
There's many of these
corporations are, of course,

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:90%
they're all over the world.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.490 align:middle line:90%
But they're contracting.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, SpaceX
has no idea what

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:90%
they're putting into space.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:84%
That's a contract
job, it's classified.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:84%
It already comes
packaged and contained.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a very controlled
environment.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Just like we are controlled
here about how much we can do,

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.079 align:middle line:90%
up there is the same thing.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And these corporations have
a really good strong hold

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And no one's there to
expose that, by the way.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, do
they come back and say

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to the Chinese government,
we just picked up

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.520 align:middle line:90%
one of your dead satellites.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Would you like it back?

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:38.872 align:middle line:90%
Do they do that?

00:17:38.872 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, are you
talking about the corporation?

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The corporation would
have no use for that anyway.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But if they wanted
to, they could take it

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:90%
if it was non-functioning.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Whether they would like to
inform the Space Science

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Administration in China,
well, that would be,

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.420 align:middle line:90%
you know, up to them.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think,
you know, there's

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:84%
nothing like anything
to promote a war

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:90%
or to take someone's property.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Because property up
there is property.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a damaged
piece of property

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.380 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's an active
satellite or active station

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:20.590 align:middle line:84%
or a body, it is property
of some origin in the world.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:10%
And one of the most
interesting things we retrieved

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:10%
was a reptilian-like arm on
a 10 foot piece of metal.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Which we later figured out
this was a weapon of some sort.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gees.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:33.907 align:middle line:90%
From?

00:18:33.907 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was just
floating with the space junk.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But where
did it come from?

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, we don't know.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the arm was
a reptilian frog-like arm

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:90%
with three fingers.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to picture this
long arm and this 10 foot

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:90%
spear.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And the arm alone was probably
four or five feet long.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is was a
very large being.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And the hand and
the fingers were

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:90%
molded into this giant spear.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to the rest of the body?

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: We have no idea.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:90%
We never found anything else.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was gone.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.390 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But we have found
bodies similar to this arm

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen these
in the projects.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
specific race of that.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
All I know is the DNA, when they
took it from the arm, matched

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:90%
the DNA of this metal.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:90%
And the metal had DNA in it.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So there was some
sort of connection.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And it really looked
like it was molded.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, we first thought
maybe it was just melted

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:35.230 align:middle line:90%
from the craft exploding.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the body
somehow quickly

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.200 align:middle line:84%
was introduced into
this giant spear.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.440 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
We figured out later
that somehow it

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
can trans-dimensionally
put its hand in the metal

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.942 align:middle line:90%
and operate this weapon.

00:19:49.942 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
that there's

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things going on up
there that's very dangerous--

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:59.050 align:middle line:84%
that by getting this space
junk back to the planet,

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.380 align:middle line:84%
reverse engineering it,
enhancing our technology

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:06.940 align:middle line:84%
in space and our space suits and
our craft and things like that

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:84%
allows us to step up that
ladder to the next level.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Whether that's going to
become declassified soon,

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:90%
I do see that happening.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.246 align:middle line:84%
Like they're already starting to
change spacesuits now, I heard.

00:20:19.246 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I haven't looked at
them, but I've heard this

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.410 align:middle line:90%
through the grapevine.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't the ETs come
and retrieve their own stuff?

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe
they do when they can.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
they want to like

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.740 align:middle line:84%
stay out of this area, this
atmosphere, and let us thrive.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're watching
us and they're

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.200 align:middle line:90%
seeing what we're doing.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times they put
stuff in space for us

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.284 align:middle line:90%
to find on purpose to help us.

00:20:44.284 --> 00:20:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They kind
of plant it up there?

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, they
implant things up there.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing that
for us to motivate

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:84%
us to reverse engineer
things and to help us

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.470 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of
scientific breakthroughs

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.894 align:middle line:84%
that we have on the
planet all the time.

00:20:57.894 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How unique
is our planet,

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.170 align:middle line:90%
do you think, in the universe?

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, it's
definitely one of a kind

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
of the universe with all the
different types of species

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.040 align:middle line:90%
and the beautiful atmosphere.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, this planet has been
here for millions of years.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's been visited
millions of times.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And it has had many, many
different civilizations

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.917 align:middle line:84%
here throughout its life and
within the Earth as well.

00:21:20.917 --> 00:21:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know
of anybody that's

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.920 align:middle line:84%
been launched into space
to retrieve any objects?

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, absolutely.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Friends?

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Colleagues.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they come back
with incredible stories?

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Always.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.480 align:middle line:90%
It's always an adventure.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just like going
into a new civilization

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
or discovering
something in a pyramid.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I look at it as a--

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm an amateur archaeologist
and paleontologist.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So when I find a
new discovery, it's

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:84%
always like the
most exciting thing,

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
whether it's just a rock that's
in the shape of something

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:84%
that someone carved
a million years ago

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:84%
or a bone that we've
never seen before.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Another amazing
find they had was

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:84%
it looked like a basketball,
but it was a perfect sphere

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:07.770 align:middle line:90%
crystal.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was very,
very highly dense.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
sitting out there.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And they thought this might
have been an unconscious

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:90%
craft at one point.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because they thought
it was moving by itself.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget, everything is
mapped in the exoatmosphere

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:90%
as far as the space junk.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And anything new, it
would always be there.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.606 align:middle line:84%
We would know, especially
if it's in orbit.

00:22:28.606 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:90%
You know, they always know.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%
They track all these things,
even beyond 85,000 feet.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So he grabbed this device
and brought it back.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
cautious with it,

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:84%
because they'd never seen--
because a piece of glass

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.860 align:middle line:84%
up there just doesn't
survive like this.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, right.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It has
obviously some sort

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:90%
of other material or something.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe, you know, this
could be a civilization.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it is a craft, who knows.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So they had to
monitor this in space.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big
question about when

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.100 align:middle line:84%
we should bring this back
to the Earth or should we.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't do
the right testing--

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
we bringing back?

00:23:09.165 --> 00:23:09.998 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --up there.

00:23:09.998 --> 00:23:12.357 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the
right equipment,

00:23:12.357 --> 00:23:13.315 align:middle line:90%
the right laboratories.

00:23:13.315 --> 00:23:15.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, that's a
salvaging operation.

00:23:15.065 --> 00:23:15.864 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:23:15.864 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:84%
But this was
something different.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:84%
This was not-- you know,
where did this come from?

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.870 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look
like a scrap piece

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:90%
of metal, that's for sure.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:84%
They got it, you know,
onto the shuttle.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And they did put it into
one of these capsules

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and they did bring it
back to the planet.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.466 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what happened,
anything after that?

00:23:34.466 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they
found out that this

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:90%
is some sort of energy device.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And they still can't crack
any type of code on it.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:90%
And that was a long time ago.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:90%
We're talking '94, '95 area.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard that
they have collected

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:90%
more of these since then.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.160 align:middle line:84%
A couple of my colleagues
has informed me.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But this is definitely some
sort of energetic device

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:84%
that pulls energy
from wherever it's at.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And it gives off a
special healing frequency.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And they have done
tests with growing cells

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:90%
around it, plant cells.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Growing human cells,
animal cells, fungi,

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:18.717 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of amazing tests.

00:24:18.717 --> 00:24:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it functions?

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it
functions somehow.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Emery, you
talked about some craft

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:90%
that might have been up there.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Have we been able to
identify any of it?

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we have, where might
they have originated from?

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we
have a huge database

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:90%
in the compartmentalized labs.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're part of a
project, like working

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:84%
on specific extraterrestrial
body, and then the next thing

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:84%
you know, they want
to pull me to take me

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to the craft of this
extraterrestrial.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.844 align:middle line:90%
Which I had no idea.

00:24:47.844 --> 00:24:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't even debriefed
there was a craft, you know,

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.968 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not allowed
to ask those questions.

00:24:51.968 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to do
anything unless asked upon.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that's how I
was able to up my security

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:90%
clearance every three months.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.899 align:middle line:90%
So what happens is you go there.

00:25:02.899 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
We'll take samples
of the craft even.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Bring it back, we
check it with the DNA

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.210 align:middle line:90%
of the extraterrestrial.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've said this many times
before, they make a match.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So then this
goes in a data base.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
understand, I'm not

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.449 align:middle line:90%
the only technician doing this.

00:25:14.449 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:84%
You understand, there's other
scientists or technicians

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:16.950 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: An army
of people, right.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.993 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: On many different
other craft and bodies.

00:25:19.993 --> 00:25:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's a huge
database of this.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what got me so
intrigued and so addicted

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.390 align:middle line:84%
to this position,
was because it's

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.194 align:middle line:84%
like looking at an encyclopedia
of the species of the universe.

00:25:31.194 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It must have been
exciting to look at that.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.234 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was like
the most profound thing.

00:25:35.234 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Especially seeing the actual
bodies and the pictures

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and the videos and the autopsies
that they had already recorded

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.770 align:middle line:90%
before I was even there.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.070 align:middle line:84%
To know this had been
going on for so long,

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and now these are new species
coming in that were not

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:53.880 align:middle line:84%
documented that I was working
on, that are still probably,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, to this
day, like you said,

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:84%
they're cross matching
species with ships and crafts

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and seeing where
do they come from.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing this huge
Christmas tree database of DNA

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials
and the craft.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're recording
all this and they're

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:15.390 align:middle line:84%
putting it down into these
compartmentalized computerized

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Which I know one of
the main databases

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.240 align:middle line:84%
is in an underground
facility in New Mexico.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
kept in space in a vault.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:90%
There's a vault in space.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's our seed,
that vault up there, almost.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right, right.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's also an underground
facility in the ocean.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's like three or
four vaults that are keeping

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:84%
the data of this that
cannot be hacked.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Once it's put in there, you
can't send a signal in there.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:90%
You can't upload it.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.090 align:middle line:84%
It has to be manually
put into these things.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.485 align:middle line:84%
Which I found is very
archaic, but at the same time,

00:26:47.485 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:84%
it's probably the
smartest thing to do.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it works.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And it works.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will
salvaging continue?

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.686 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to be a big business.

00:26:55.686 --> 00:26:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the civilian
community, I think,

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.780 align:middle line:84%
needs to start cleaning
up just our space junk

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:90%
that's already up there.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So I think they're
going to make that public soon.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't be
surprised after this airs,

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:84%
maybe within six months
they might come forward

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.063 align:middle line:84%
and say well, we know we
need to start cleaning up

00:27:10.063 --> 00:27:11.573 align:middle line:90%
this mess out there.

00:27:11.573 --> 00:27:13.072 align:middle line:84%
And you know, later
on down the road

00:27:13.072 --> 00:27:14.447 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, well,
by the way, we

00:27:14.447 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:84%
found this other piece of
junk, we don't know what it is.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.871 align:middle line:84%
And they've already been
doing this for 20 years.

00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's going to be
a release of this information

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.770 align:middle line:90%
to the public very soon.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for being on
"Cosmic Disclosure," Emery.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Thanks for
having me, George.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
"Cosmic Disclosure"

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.810 align:middle line:90%
with our guest, Emery Smith.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.681 align:middle line:90%
Thanks again for watching.

00:27:33.681 --> 00:27:36.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.710 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.174 align:middle line:10%
and secret space programs.

00:27:43.174 --> 00:27:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think
there's something

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.950 align:middle line:90%
going to surface soon.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I think us talking about this,
people start investigating

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and some people
start coming forward.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> This is just one program.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.390 align:middle line:90%
They have a bunch of programs.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:84%
My involvement, I'm
just one of thousands.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we've been spliced
over a millennia with many,

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:08.750 align:middle line:84%
many different genomes from
other races and other plants

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.470 align:middle line:84%
as well from across
the universe.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.920 align:middle line:90%
