00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we are with Tim,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:84%
who is speaking with
us from Germany.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:10%
that's related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.602 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you very
much for having me.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.227 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So, Tim, I think
a lot of our viewers

00:00:35.227 --> 00:00:37.420 align:middle line:84%
want to know if you've
ever had any up close,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:84%
direct contact with
UFOs in your program

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:90%
that you can talk to us about.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: Well, I've never
been on a flying craft.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:10%
But I've seen three
particular strange objects

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.720 align:middle line:10%
in an underground
base in Germany.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So one of it was a really
interesting encounter

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not quite
sure if it's meant

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:90%
to be a flying object or not.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But the most
interesting thing was

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.660 align:middle line:84%
that I was walking through
a hall with a superior.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And there was this kind of oval
shaped, metallic, shiny object

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that had four kind of legs
or something to stand on.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was
the size of it?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: 15 meters in length
and approximately 3 meters

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:90%
in height.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But, again, I cannot tell if
it's a flying object or meant

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:84%
to be a flying craft or any
kind of other technology.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But the really interesting thing
at that moment really confused

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
me or was really
interesting to see

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
was the person who was
working on that object.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was so unusual
about this person working

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:90%
on the craft?

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, the
really unusual thing

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:84%
is he seemed to be repairing
or working on that object.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And he was using a
silver-ish, shining metal

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:90%
object in his hand.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And you had like blue electric
sparkles that came from that.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:84%
But the super interesting fact
was that he was doing that

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and was floating in mid-air,
which was never seen to me

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:90%
ever before.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you describe
this man in detail?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I can.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:84%
This person was actually
wearing a blue suit, almost

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:90%
like a bodysuit or something.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:90%
He was wearing a kind of a mask.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
It looked like those masks
that people in the Olympics--

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:90%
the fencing teams are wearing.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was using
this electric device

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.095 align:middle line:84%
that had this blue sparkles
while he was doing that.

00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, how
tall was this person?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And could you see his hands?

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: He was wearing
gloves, black gloves.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And in his, I don't
know, left or right hand,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
he had this solid
object that he was

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:84%
using as a tool, which I don't
know what purpose it had.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And did you
speak with this person?

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Once I
crossed that scenery,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly had this
conversation in my mind.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So I suddenly-- which I
haven't had experienced

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:84%
before this kind of
conversation, where I just

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
was hearing a voice, saying,
oh, hey, hello there.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
in my mind, hi,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
which was kind of incredible
because I've never

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.060 align:middle line:90%
experienced that before.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I had this impression
in my mind that he

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:90%
was saying, where are you from?

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:90%
What planet?

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Earth.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.160 align:middle line:90%
And I went on.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So that was a very
brief conversation.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- because it only
lasted a few, I don't know,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.370 align:middle line:84%
maybe half a minute or something
and took only half a minute

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:90%
to get across the scenery.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:90%
But there was so much going on.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:84%
You had this huge
silver-ish object,

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.834 align:middle line:90%
which I cannot say what it was.

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:84%
You had this person who was
floating in mid-air, using kind

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:84%
of a wand or
something, some kind

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
of metal-ish object
with blue sparks,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and had this weird
conversation in my mind.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.480 align:middle line:90%
So that was kind of unusual.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's talk a little
bit more about the craft.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe it was a man-made
or a back engineered UFO

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrial?

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Since I cannot say, it
was a craft or maybe some kind

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
of technology used
for something else.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
But I came across
other people recently,

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:84%
books that talked about
similar objects that

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
seem to be overly oval form and
had these four stabilization

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:84%
thingies going on in order to
land and to position itself.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So I could assume
that it was a craft.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was it all
one piece of metal?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Were there scenes
or windows, lights?

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
What else can you tell
us about this object?

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: No, it had no windows,
no visual entrance compared

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:84%
to the other two
objects that I've seen.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:84%
It did not seem to be
created out of one piece

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.580 align:middle line:84%
because the other objects
that I'm going to talk about,

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:84%
they all seem to be designed
from one piece of metal

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
in that way, no composing
elements, no screws

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.970 align:middle line:90%
This particular object was oval.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And it had lots and
lots of details to it.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:90%
So it was not smooth in itself.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned
two other crafts.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about them.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So another craft
that I've seen--

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
that seems to be in use.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I've seen it in
a hangar, underground bases.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was just about
to start, or let's say

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:84%
it was starting,
levitating in that way

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.470 align:middle line:90%
and then moving out of the hole.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was a huge, dark,
metallic, triangular-shaped

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:90%
craft.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:90%
It had red lights--

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:84%
three red lights and a round
red light in the middle.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
impressive to see.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've been informed later
on that this is fairly known

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
in the ufology world as, I
think, TR-3B or something.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: TR-3B is
an American craft.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But it seems as
if the US is also

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.250 align:middle line:90%
operating with them in Europe.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And it seems as if they
are also selling them.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.662 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Would you
say that the craft

00:07:11.662 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:90%
was a human-constructed craft?

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, 100%.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Later on, I realized that there
are sightings of those crafts

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.950 align:middle line:90%
around in Europe.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they seem to operate here.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, it was
definitely something

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle line:84%
that is stored on the ground
and used by humans for whatever

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.875 align:middle line:90%
human mission they were on.

00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Describe the size of
the craft or the proportion

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.328 align:middle line:90%
of the height and width.

00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's pretty hard to say.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that
you could easily

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:84%
fit three to five cars
in it, I would say.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So it was pretty large in
that perspective, yeah.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So it takes-- well, I've never
seen a conventional flight

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:90%
fighter or something.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But I would assume that
it's bigger than that.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell us about the third
craft you observed closely.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, the third craft
was the most profound experience

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:23.660 align:middle line:84%
because it was actually an
exhibition of a Grey craft.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So they've taken a real
Grey UFO and put it

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:90%
into one of those facilities.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:90%
And you could actually enter it.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And we've done that with
a handful of scientists

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:90%
that were looking at it.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:84%
But people were
already working on it.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And this wasn't the first time
that anybody has opened it

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:90%
or entered it.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you
enter the craft?

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I was one of those
people that got to enter it.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well, what did you see?

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the way
I understand this,

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.600 align:middle line:84%
this particular
craft is designed

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.280 align:middle line:90%
to take on several humans.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So it was designed bigger
than the usual Grey crafts

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
because the Greys itself, they
don't demand too much space

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.380 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.560 align:middle line:90%
So it was a bigger craft.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:90%
And I could easily fit into it.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.530 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
that came to my mind

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:84%
when I saw it-- the first thing
that I noticed in that way

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
was this super smooth,
metallic outer appearance.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So it was super seamless,
metallic, shiny, Grey.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:84%
It had like a ring around,
like a roundish ring,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:84%
and an oval top,
which sat up on it.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So that was kind of
impressive to me.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:90%
It was larger.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that if you
take a standard hotel room,

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I would say like you should
take two or three of them,

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:84%
probably around 15 square
meters or something in size.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
So my impression, and I found
that pretty interesting,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:84%
is the way we perceive material,
is that our brain is constantly

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:84%
checking for the
density of material

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:90%
and the weight of a material.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to
pick up something,

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:84%
the brain has already
calculated in its mind

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:84%
how heavy something is,
how dense something is.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
really interesting

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:84%
was that the whole craft looked
like it was super, super light,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:90%
still very dense in that way.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of weird.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a-- I don't know.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But I was under the impression
that I could lift that craft

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.300 align:middle line:84%
with my bare hands, which
I probably couldn't.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.595 align:middle line:84%
But it felt like that,
if you know what I mean.

00:11:07.595 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: From the
moment you walked in,

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:90%
describe exactly what you saw.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So it seemed like
somebody had broken up

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.840 align:middle line:90%
the entrance of the craft.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
It more or less looked like a
construction site or something.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you could
imagine this roundish,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:84%
silver-ish object as
a cake or something,

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.380 align:middle line:84%
then it felt like somebody
had taken a slice out of it

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
in order to make it accessible
and in order to go into it.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking
if there were stairs,

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.930 align:middle line:90%
there were no stairs.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But somebody had just put those
typical construction metal

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:55.040 align:middle line:84%
things just on the ground
in order to get into it.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And this was clearly not
part of the intricate nature

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:90%
of this craft.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:84%
It was just what you get at
Home Depot, this typical metal

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:84%
that you just throw
onto something in order

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:90%
to get into it.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was it one level or
multiple levels on the inside?

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It depends.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So the accessible area of
it was actually one level.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So you had like one
big, roundish room.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
But there was in
the right corner--

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:84%
if you think of
walking just into it,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:38.900 align:middle line:84%
there was a very interesting,
intricate, geometric door

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:84%
that led into the lower
part of this craft that

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
seem to have the propulsion
system or whatever into it.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle line:90%
And the fascinating thing is--

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:84%
what I found is that the
way this door was designed,

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle line:84%
it folded into the lower
level of this craft,

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.740 align:middle line:84%
almost like an origami
kind of construction,

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:11.630 align:middle line:84%
where you don't have
mechanics or technology that

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:90%
opens that door.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
But through the
way it's been hold

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
together through
its own folding,

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:84%
that if you push in it, it will
open in that way very smoothly.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need very much
energy in order to open that.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So it was super
interesting for me.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:84%
If you could just
slightly touch it,

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:84%
it would give into that
motion and open up.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you see
a lot of darkness

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:44.810 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of weird
coils and mechanic stuff

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:84%
in the lower deck, which
seemed to be the propulsion

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.995 align:middle line:90%
or technological system.

00:13:50.995 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What more can you
tell us about the craft?

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So when you
enter it, you suddenly

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:84%
stand inside of this very well
constructed and very clean,

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:84%
roundish room, which
was interesting to me

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:84%
because entering it
was so dirty in a way.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:84%
You saw all those
construction stuff.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And once we were
inside of it, it

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:84%
felt like there
was no dust at all.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was illuminated,
which was odd to me

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.950 align:middle line:84%
as well because none of the
technology was activated.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Nothing seemed to be
powered in that way.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:84%
But the room itself
was illuminated.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:90%
It was bright.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:90%
The entrance wasn't bright.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.560 align:middle line:90%
The entrance was darkish.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.820 align:middle line:90%
It was broken up, kind of weird.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But the entrance
was super bright.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And it was super clean.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And I had two
questions in my mind.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Question one was, how
could it be illuminated

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:90%
if there was no light source?

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And two was, how in the
world could there not

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:84%
be any dust on this very
shiny surface of the craft?

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.222 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there any
chairs or screens or windows?

00:15:13.222 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes, there were.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, there were
two very small stools--

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:27.210 align:middle line:84%
chairs, better to say,
almost square in that nature,

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and really, really
small in that way.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So it basically could
fit a child or something.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Looked a bit like only a
child could sit in there.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of
this roundish room,

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.660 align:middle line:84%
you had this-- which seemed to
be like a display or something.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:90%
It was not activated.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
But I assume, because that looks
much like a very advanced, I

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.530 align:middle line:84%
don't know, roundish
television or something

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:90%
without it being so dark.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Because if you see nowadays
televisions, the material,

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
it looks kind of
dark-ish or something.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:90%
But this one wasn't dark.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:90%
It looked still like glass--

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.220 align:middle line:90%
metallic glass or something.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.020 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't activated.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.727 align:middle line:84%
But in front of it, there
were two very small chairs.

00:16:20.727 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And were there
any control panels at all?

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: In front of
those two little stools,

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:84%
there was like a
control panel or a--

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't a desk.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:90%
But it looked a bit like a desk.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't have any pilot's
joystick or something,

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:84%
which I would have
assumed those things have.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%
But it had two
fields that I assume

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.190 align:middle line:84%
are there in order to
place your hands on it.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:90%
So that was there.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And other than that, not
many mechanical buttons.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But it looked like this is
where you can navigate it.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And once everything got
powered and activated,

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:90%
magically, buttons would appear.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:10.692 align:middle line:90%
That is my impression.

00:17:10.692 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if that's true.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
But that was my impression
because it was the only desk

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.873 align:middle line:90%
in that way in the whole room.

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: As you're
standing in the craft, Tim,

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
compared to you, how
tall was the craft?

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:84%
Like, could you touch
the ceiling yourself?

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I couldn't touch
the roof, actually.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty tall.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So, again, this craft, as much
of the scientists have told me,

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:84%
is being used in order
to take in humans,

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and in order to perform
certain tasks on them.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So everything was
built kind of space-y.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
You also had in the
middle of this--

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:84%
not quite in the
middle, a little more

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:90%
to the entrance, you had this--

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:84%
it was just a plain platform,
still out of the same material

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:90%
It seemed to be like a bed.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But it did not have any
external parts or something.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It was just a flat surface that
was meant to put a human on it.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing to me was

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:84%
that it had this
kind of pillow where

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.430 align:middle line:90%
the head should be placed.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But it was reversed in
that way because humans,

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:84%
they used their pillows in a
way that it stabilized the neck

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:90%
or should stabilize the neck.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So you can place
your head onto it.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And on the surface,
there was this--

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:90%
it was curved in.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So you had to place your head
into it instead of onto it,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:90%
if that makes sense.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're describing
craft within Europe.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Do you think these are
the same crafts observed

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:90%
in other countries?

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Or are different beings working
with these other governments

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.403 align:middle line:90%
around the world?

00:19:05.403 --> 00:19:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Interesting question.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So I've never been
to a crash site.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I've never been to any foreign
underground base or something.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what
they examine those.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So all the reports that we're
getting from other people,

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I cannot say if it's
the same technology,

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:84%
the same things
that they perceived.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:84%
But I know that the
Greys itself, they

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:90%
are selling this technology.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you see
a UAP, or a UFO,

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:84%
that looks like
this saucer design,

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't necessarily mean
that it's coming from the--

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:84%
well, it means that the patent
is coming from the Greys.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
that it contains

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:56.630 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial life it could
very well come from humans.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What currency are we
using to make this exchange?

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:90%
And what do the Greys want?

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Oh, that's interesting
because the contracts

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys are doing
with the government

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and different other
groups on this planet,

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.160 align:middle line:84%
they sometimes do not
seem to make any sense

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:90%
to the contractees in that way.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:84%
So because the Greys have no
interest at all in resources,

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:84%
because they have
managed to overcome

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.310 align:middle line:90%
this need for material--

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:33.860 align:middle line:84%
their reality and
their technology

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and their civilization
is so far advanced

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that they don't seem to
have this necessity anymore.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But they sometimes
ask for wild things

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:51.230 align:middle line:84%
that you would not expect to
ask in exchange for technology,

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:59.010 align:middle line:84%
like, for example, the right
to communicate with person

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:05.670 align:middle line:84%
A or person B or the right
to fly into certain areas

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.510 align:middle line:84%
at certain times, so all
this kind of stuff that

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be necessarily things
that a human would think of.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But the Greys always
seem to be trading things

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:25.030 align:middle line:84%
that they know would make
sense along the line.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So maybe contacting person A and
getting the explicit agreement

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:84%
for that would mean to them
very much in the future

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:84%
in an upcoming
episode or something

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:43.320 align:middle line:84%
that humans just don't have
any idea at that moment.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.402 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:21:44.402 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what
happened to those Greys

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:90%
who occupied this craft?

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: OK, so I'm not quite sure
if the Greys gave this craft

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:84%
to the group by free
will in that way.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:84%
But they did not seem
to care about it either.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So it seemed to be kind of
an arrangement or something.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I would even say because there's
so much technology exchange

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that went on at that
time that this was

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:90%
part of a pre-negotiated deal.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that confused
me was the way people kind of

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:84%
broke open the entrance
in order to get into it.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:90%
So that was kind of weird.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.770 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, I
wouldn't say that it's coming.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't taken
away from somebody.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And at the very least,
the Greys did not

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:84%
show aggressive behavior
in order to get it back

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:84%
So it seemed to be
fairly on a mutual basis.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was your role
that day with the craft?

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: So I basically--

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I was in the field of
communication science.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:90%
So I basically just visited it.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So in the way that
any company sometimes

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:14.360 align:middle line:84%
makes a, I don't know, a trip
to something work related,

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:90%
it was just--

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
for me, just a way to accompany
those other scientists

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:90%
and to get into that craft.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, most of them were
actually technicians or coming

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:84%
from other projects, which I
don't have information about.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So it was just an exhibition
in that way, just to enter it

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:90%
and to acknowledge that.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How advanced are
when it comes to space travel?

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And what have we achieved in
the covert space programs?

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: From my point of view,
Haim Eshed is absolutely right.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:10%
And he was in charge of
the Israeli space program.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said humanity is in
contact with different species.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.280 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely confirm that.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.150 align:middle line:84%
He also said humanity is
dealing with the Galactic

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Federation or something
that he called a federation.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:09.740 align:middle line:90%
And I would confirm that.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And he also said that humanity
already has a base on Mars

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and is in operations in
that field or on that planet

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.770 align:middle line:90%
and would also confirm that.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask me
how far advanced

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.720 align:middle line:84%
is the advanced
military, then I would

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:84%
say that everyone who is
assuming that humanity

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.330 align:middle line:84%
is close to going off
planet, that's been

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:90%
done for at least the 1980s.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean,
aside from Mars,

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
where else do
humans have visited?

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, it might sound
surprising to too many.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:54.340 align:middle line:84%
But the human military has
explored the whole solar system

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And from what I know from
different other projects,

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.550 align:middle line:84%
they've also explored
different other solar systems

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and got in contact, especially
with human relatives

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
that also spread over
to those solar systems.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how well did that
go when humans visited beings

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.850 align:middle line:90%
from other constellations?

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I would say that
those relatives were

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:26.260 align:middle line:84%
quite happy to celebrate
this kind of family reunion.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, there are some
more exotic types

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:84%
of beings that have a
close eye on humanity

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:84%
because still there's this
warlike mentality to them.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What
conclusion can you draw

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.290 align:middle line:84%
from the Grey UFO, back
engineering, or working side

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.910 align:middle line:90%
by side with ET life?

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The most interesting
thing to me, observing kind of

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:84%
from the outside this
whole field of ufology,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
is that we have a lot of people
in intelligence and governance

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
that acknowledged the
fact that ETs are real,

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and this enormous
universe is full of life.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And they also acknowledged
that there are

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:90%
some kind of advanced projects.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:84%
But they do not
acknowledge or seem

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:24.110 align:middle line:84%
to not acknowledge the fact that
humanity is already out there.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I found that pretty
interesting because, yes,

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:32.590 align:middle line:84%
humans are indeed already
capable of going off planet,

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.020 align:middle line:90%
have done so, and are doing so.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.
