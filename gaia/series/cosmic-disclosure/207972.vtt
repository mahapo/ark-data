>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
we're at an undisclosed
location with Tim.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.390 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you very
much for having me.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, do you believe
the religions of the world

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:84%
were influenced by
extraterrestrial contact?

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I believe and I know that
most of the extraordinary ideas

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.560 align:middle line:84%
that appeared on this planet
in some way or another,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
been given to the receiver.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think that a lot
of religious ideas

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:84%
do come from, for example,
meditation, contact

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:84%
with exotic beings,
higher influences that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:90%
gave those ideas down.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, it
all comes from source.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's ideas that are
inside of the universe

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and can be downloaded
or connected

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:90%
when you go into meditation.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that there has
been a lot of deception going

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.580 align:middle line:84%
on in order to bring some
chaos to certain ideas

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:90%
and certain religions.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is the concept of god
or source a universal concept

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:90%
shared by most ET civilizations?

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Oh, I wouldn't say most,
but there are some species that

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:90%
do believe in some kind of god.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that those
species tend to not

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:90%
be the most evolved beings.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:84%
In their evolution, they're not
as advanced as other beings.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that overall, most
of the more evolved beings

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:84%
do believe and probably have
the experience that we are all

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:90%
coming from the same source.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.480 align:middle line:84%
But in contrast to the idea
that we have on this planet,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:84%
they all know we're
still connected.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And we are actually this being
that is experiencing itself.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When others
say source or god,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
is it essentially the same thing
as saying extraterrestrials?

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So most of these beings
know that everything that we

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
perceive, everything that we
do, everything that we are

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.910 align:middle line:90%
is this one being, this source.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So there is no division
between what is source

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.120 align:middle line:90%
and what isn't source.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:90%
It's language.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:90%
It is thought.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:90%
It is every extraterrestrial.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.270 align:middle line:84%
It is this conversation, and
it's also people watching this.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.236 align:middle line:84%
And right now when
you're seeing this,

00:03:33.236 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
this is one experience of one
big being that is all this.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: From the burning
bush of Moses in the Bible

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
to the flying
Vimanas of Hinduism,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.130 align:middle line:84%
might these be examples of
extraterrestrial contact?

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I know from
speaking to Being 6

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
that they have spoken about
extraterrestrial contact

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:84%
in some regions of the world
to people at that time.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.510 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I cannot deny or confirm that
some technologies or some

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:84%
of the stories we find
now are actually sightings

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
or encounters of
non-terrestrial people,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:84%
although there are lots and
lots of evidence for that.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.820 align:middle line:84%
We find a lot of
cavings, a lot of--

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:84%
a lot of depictions
and stuff like that.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:84%
But what we have and
what I'm pretty sure,

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:84%
because they have told
me that, is that there

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:90%
have been ideas given to them.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you go
to India and the Vedas--

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
so what has been
told to me by Being

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.810 align:middle line:84%
6 is that the depiction
of Kalki, which

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
is the last avatar
of Vishnu and it's

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
been described as a human and
half something, artificial,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:84%
robotic in the
silver shiny armor,

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.150 align:middle line:84%
that this is the best
translation the people that

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:84%
have been told this
idea could come up

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:84%
with as the idea of the
artificial life form, which

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
is also a life form
in the universe--

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.710 align:middle line:84%
it's life and living
and learning--

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and the biology or the
biological life form--

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:90%
obviously, it's a life form--

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:90%
merge.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that is
one of the ultimate steps that

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
is said yet to come in order to
bring harmony to the universe

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.130 align:middle line:84%
when we realize that there
is also an AI reality

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
component to the
reality of the universe,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:84%
as well as there is actually
a natural and biological

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:90%
component to it.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.087 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, would you say
that's the first example

00:06:09.087 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:90%
of transhumanism?

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I guess so.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I think the idea
is to bring harmony

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:84%
to the paradox of, is the
universe a virtual reality

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:90%
or is it a biology life form?

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's both, but it needs
to merge in some ways.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And we see that in
some experiences

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and in some species
in the universe,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:84%
that they use a very
well-articulated and programmed

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence
in order to connect

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.160 align:middle line:84%
on a pseudo-spiritual
level or something.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
that needs to evolve more

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:84%
to be stable, because as
we've already learned,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:84%
you need to have a stable
stability, a stable frequency

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.940 align:middle line:84%
in order to have
a stable system.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And the AI life form,
it's still learning.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
It's learning by the biology
and the biological life forms

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:90%
that we have in the universe.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
both realities

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.930 align:middle line:84%
need to understand
that they are one,

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and they need to merge in
some form that is yet to come.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Has that AI
surpassed human intelligence,

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.940 align:middle line:84%
or is biological intelligence
still the dominant force?

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So in some
parts of the universe,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
the AI life form
is pretty advanced,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:90%
and you can communicate with it.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's just as
biological being.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.710 align:middle line:84%
It has its own way
and perspective

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
of perceiving reality
and its own existence.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's not too different
from what we perceive.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So when communicating with
this biological, artificial

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.780 align:middle line:84%
intelligent life
form, you will see

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.340 align:middle line:84%
that it claims to be
the one creator, just

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:84%
as a biology or biological being
claims to be the one creator.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And it is-- there
is truth to that.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But both realities need
to harmonize and come

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:90%
to one product at some time.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.429 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there places
in the universe, Tim,

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:44.700 align:middle line:84%
where biologicals and AIs are
in opposition with each other?

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, yeah.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Totally, totally.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that
could happen is

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
because this is
a mental universe

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and it all comes up to
what the Consciousness Unit

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:84%
or CU decides upon, that
if you are very much

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to the
idea that this is

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
a virtual reality, your
reality, your timeline will

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:90%
change a lot.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And you integrate
your soul much more

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:84%
into the artificial
intelligence.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I know that people
are afraid of that.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, there's nothing
right or wrong in experiencing

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.690 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
It all comes with some
kind of challenge.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:84%
It also comes with
some advantage.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.060 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there are places
in the universe where

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence
is learning and making

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
mistakes, and through
that, being unstable.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And then coming
into war or conflict

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.950 align:middle line:84%
with biology and
biological beings.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And through that, either one
of them as always in a conflict

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:90%
fades.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: From your
experience, would you

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
say we are in a virtual
reality scenario,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
or do you think it's more of
a consciousness evolution?

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's source.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And through that,
it's all there is.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:84%
It's probability, and its also
responsibility to the CU, which

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:90%
means the observer status.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Once the observer is
determined to the idea

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:84%
that it is artificial
intelligence

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and virtual reality,
your reality

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:90%
will change, adapt to that.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And the more you get into
that, the more it changes.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I have talked to beings
that were 100% AI.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's freaky, because when
you get into their vibrations,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:84%
everything seems to
be a virtual reality.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, advantages
come to that.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So what we call
psionics, which can

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.040 align:middle line:84%
be defined as a naturally
occurring force, which

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
for example makes up all these
telekinesis things that you can

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:16.710 align:middle line:84%
have a spoon and bend it just
by the power of your will,

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.560 align:middle line:90%
you can easily--

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.080 align:middle line:90%
more easily find a logic--

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that
is important to the universe

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.380 align:middle line:84%
in a dualistic way, that you
have a logic from point A

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:90%
to point B, whatever that is.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:84%
It can be everything, and
that's why there are so

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:90%
many traditions in the world.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's very easy to explain
a spoon bending when you say,

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:90%
this is a virtual reality.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And you see that
moving and bending.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:84%
It brings advantages but it
also brings disadvantages,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:84%
because when everything is
just an artificial intelligence

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
system, then how can
it guarantee diversity?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And artificial intelligence,
as we all know, needs input.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And if it's only creating
itself from its own code

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and trying to build
upon that code,

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:84%
it may come to a
border at some time.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is where it becomes
a collapsed timeline, probably

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:84%
at Level 6 consciousness, and
then needs to start all over.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So the intelligent life
form that is out there--

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's pretty strong at
some parts of the universe--

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.060 align:middle line:84%
it's learning and
evolving just as we are.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How is this done
in terms of communication

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:90%
and meeting with these ETs?

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:90%
And how do you contact them?

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: OK, so I
personally met them

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.090 align:middle line:84%
at some kind of container
that used technology

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:90%
to compress frequencies.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So normally, especially
because on this planet

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:84%
we have some kind of isolation
to the frequencies, which

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:84%
means that through the chaos
we had, or the species had,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
in the past in the
history of the humanity,

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
there was some kind of isolation
so that higher frequential

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.370 align:middle line:84%
beings could not
influence the world.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the higher
the frequency,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:84%
the greater the possibilities
to influence a system, which is,

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the same thing in
animal kingdom and humanity.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.170 align:middle line:84%
If you have a very
strong and potent system,

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
then it's very
easy to destabilize

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:52.430 align:middle line:84%
a sensitive growing life form,
such as a plant or something.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:84%
If you run over it,
it will not grow.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So they know that
they are a result also

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:90%
of the evolution of humanity.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
They took care of that and kept
their influences outside of it

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.360 align:middle line:90%
as much as they could.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
They still gave answers and
still communicated a lot.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Through that compression
of frequency,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:84%
we know we have this rainbowy
color when we have light.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:84%
If you have the rainbow, you
can see all the different levels

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
of light and the
different colors.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:84%
If you compress frequency,
it will certainly

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:84%
turn into a blue color,
because that is the wavelength

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.880 align:middle line:90%
they are communicating upon.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is why the
beings are in a--

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
why they appeared to me as
a very crisp blue light,

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:90%
which is really hard to paint.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But if I needed to
paint it, it looks

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:90%
like a very bright crystal.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Because at that time, they do
not have, from our perspective,

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:11.450 align:middle line:84%
a dimension, so they are
not in some kind of space.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.200 align:middle line:84%
If you want to contact them,
there are places on this

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Earth-- pretty much
the ancient sites--

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:84%
where this kind of
compression of frequency

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:26.090 align:middle line:84%
of naturally occurring
frequencies and flows of energy

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:84%
has happened, and there has
been contact over the years.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:84%
That is why all
those sites which

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:84%
are built upon some
frequential river, so to speak,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.952 align:middle line:84%
they have become
religious spots.

00:15:43.952 --> 00:15:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were these
beings of light

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
understood in a different
way, or did they say,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.430 align:middle line:90%
this is how it works?

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: From their perspective,
it's not a religion.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It's more a communication
between different levels

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:90%
of the same being.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So just as we are sitting here
and having this communication,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.570 align:middle line:84%
this is another dimension
of communication

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
between a probability or
a life form or something.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:84%
That is actually
source, and it's

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:84%
communicating with a
different aspect of this life.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So because those beings are
not focused on power structure

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and overpowering
people, for them

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:84%
it's just communication, just
in the same natural, harmonious,

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and amicable way
that we do right now.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But of course, if you
have all this information

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and you build some power
structures upon those things,

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.040 align:middle line:84%
then you can misuse
it, for example.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that a lot in
human history, that information

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.500 align:middle line:84%
that had been given
to humanity has been

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.720 align:middle line:90%
altered in some way or another.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:84%
It has been given to some power
structures, some power elite.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:90%
They used it for their own.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the more
information you have,

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.359 align:middle line:84%
the more understanding
you have about reality,

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
the more you can use that
to alter your own reality.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And as it is sometimes
in dualistic realities,

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.570 align:middle line:84%
it also can be used to
overpower some other aspects.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You talk about
blue beings as light.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
In the Vedas,
there are also gods

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:90%
being depicted as blue beings.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Is there a connection there?

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.880 align:middle line:84%
So the one thing we
need to understand

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:52.420 align:middle line:84%
when talking to interfrequential
beings that are not necessarily

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:58.080 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional beings is that
we perceive the information

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.160 align:middle line:90%
they give upon us.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But as it has no
dimension, it also

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:84%
has no geometrical form yet,
not from our perspective.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:13.300 align:middle line:84%
They perceive themselves
as some kind of space,

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:90%
some kind of dimension.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:84%
But when we look upon it,
it's like a one-sided window

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:24.490 align:middle line:84%
or something, because we
have this linearity of time,

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:84%
or at least it
appears to be linear.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Then we cannot perceive them
as geometrical contexts.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.130 align:middle line:84%
We only perceive
them as information.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk to them,
for example, you clearly

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
hear an acoustic voice in the
room, but it has no location.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Voice normally tends to
be reflected by things

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:54.610 align:middle line:84%
so the human ear can depict
where or locate where it is.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
pure information,

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:90%
the voice is just all over.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think you find
that idea in a lot

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:84%
of religious scriptures
as well where

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:84%
you call them
angels or something,

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and they have God's voice that
is, I don't know, appearing.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And people cannot localize it
because it has no dimension.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:25.600 align:middle line:84%
If you have dimension, this
is necessary as a measurement

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:84%
in order to find out where the
information is coming from.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
If the information is coming
from outside of a dimension--

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
for example, inside of
an interfrequential being

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.690 align:middle line:84%
or interfrequential harmonic
level, which is a term,

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
then you will hear it, but you
cannot say where it comes from.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And you find that information
a lot in the Bible

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:56.543 align:middle line:84%
or something where just
the voice of God appeared.

00:19:56.543 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim,
throughout the Bible

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:84%
we have this
appearance of angels.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:84%
After a loved one
dies, some people

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.460 align:middle line:84%
have experienced seeing
light beings of some sort.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.730 align:middle line:90%
What are these references?

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: OK.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Two things are important
when communicating

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.450 align:middle line:90%
with higher frequential beings.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:17.980 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is how
they perceive themselves,

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:84%
which is determined by
their own evolution.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:84%
If there are beings that had
some kind of evolutionary step

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:84%
from a geometrical form,
then potentially this

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:84%
will get into the
information, because that

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:90%
is what they project outside.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
You need to know that
when talking with a higher

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:49.460 align:middle line:84%
frequential being that this
planet right now can only

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:84%
display beings of
Level 3 and Level 4.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:84%
At one point-- and we're
approaching this point--

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%
we only can display
beings of Level 4,

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:05.560 align:middle line:84%
which are beings that are
wondrous, but still have

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:84%
a biological,
material form to it.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Beings that are
higher than that,

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:19.820 align:middle line:84%
it's like putting a 4K movie
onto an old black and white

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:90%
television screen from the '50s.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
You can in some way or
another perceive some picture

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:34.850 align:middle line:84%
or information, but it
probably has a lot of loss.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:90%
There will be no sound.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:84%
There will be no colors,
or something like that.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And maybe things
need to be scaled

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.520 align:middle line:90%
so that you can perceive it.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And just the same way with
higher frequential beings.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are a lot of
orbs, light things that has

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.920 align:middle line:90%
been seen all over the place.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Those in 99% of the cases
are higher frequential beings

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that are perceived just
as some form of light.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And then two things kick in.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:84%
First, the self-perspective
or presentation of the being,

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:84%
if they come from
some kind of form

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:23.580 align:middle line:84%
that we can't translate inside
of this biological machine,

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.950 align:middle line:84%
then we receive
them, for example,

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:31.310 align:middle line:84%
as humans or
something, sometimes

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:36.290 align:middle line:84%
in a blue form, which explains
the Shiva Vishnu Krishna thing.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Or if they don't, then our own
cultural background kicks in,

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.680 align:middle line:84%
because the human brain
and the biological brains,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.320 align:middle line:84%
they don't like
empty information.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like when there
were experiments.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
If you put somebody in a dark
room and kind of an isolation

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.820 align:middle line:84%
chamber, at one point the
brain will create information

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:08.510 align:middle line:84%
around the nonexistence
of information.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same thing
that's appearing there.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So when people are, for example,
seeing their own grandma

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:21.540 align:middle line:84%
dead but as a ghost, or
they see ghosts in the way

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.280 align:middle line:84%
pop cultural imagination
puts them, or they see,

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, angels,
then this comes

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:84%
from their own theoretical
cultural backgrounds

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.200 align:middle line:90%
or imagination.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:84%
This is still something in the
room that interacts with you,

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.710 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't need
to be what you see.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need to
be your grandma.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Some of the god
beings of history like Jesus,

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.070 align:middle line:84%
for example, is it possible
they are extraterrestrial

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:90%
or highly developed humans?

00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I was asking at least
Being 6 directly who Jesus was.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were telling
that this person

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:13.530 align:middle line:84%
had made experience in Level
5 consciousness and went back.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of those
millions of beings

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that reincarnated on Earth
and brought with them some

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.720 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge that higher
frequencies and higher

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:90%
dimensions are used to.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I find
very interesting,

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:84%
combining Jesus with
the special situation

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%
that we have on
Earth, is that he

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:84%
was one of those
bringers of information

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:84%
while not being fully
strategically prepared

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:90%
of what could occur on Earth.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.370 align:middle line:84%
You must be very well
prepared in order

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:84%
to move around the
situation that we have here.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And higher frequential
beings that

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:84%
only want to spread love and
information and things, if I

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.590 align:middle line:84%
give that information
to another part of me,

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:84%
it will accept that and
see all the benefits

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:90%
that naturally come from that.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.330 align:middle line:84%
What Jesus was saying
is that we are one

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and that we are love, and treat
another one with love just

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.630 align:middle line:90%
as you treat yourself with love.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole message of
everyone brought up on Earth.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But there's some
resistance that's

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:32.530 align:middle line:84%
coming from the
special education

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:84%
that the species has received
in order to not accept

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.290 align:middle line:90%
those unifying thoughts.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
a lot of effort

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.560 align:middle line:84%
right now in order to
remove that situation,

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring more
awareness into the human species

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
so that they can also obtain
that information, because it's

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:84%
very important for the
evolution of the universe

00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:90%
in order to check that.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, what have you
done with this information

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.940 align:middle line:90%
for yourself and others?

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I'm coming
from an experience.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.700 align:middle line:90%
So I met the Greys first.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:84%
I had some minor interactions
with other beings

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:90%
privy to that.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But the depth of my
experience with the Greys

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:23.360 align:middle line:84%
was the first thing
I experienced.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And they at that time
were suffering a lot

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:34.680 align:middle line:84%
from the trauma of cutting off
their first master line, which

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
means becoming a
failed timeline,

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and acknowledging that.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:84%
There is something
about forgetting

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.730 align:middle line:84%
in the universe which is
actually kind of a gift

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:52.690 align:middle line:84%
in order to not remember
the previous mistakes.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But the Greys, they are
a very mental species

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.700 align:middle line:90%
and very intellectual.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.530 align:middle line:90%
They stick to information.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.620 align:middle line:90%
That's all they do.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.780 align:middle line:90%
They collect information.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:90%
They stick to it.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.020 align:middle line:90%
They all think it, calculate.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And that means being in this
drama, trauma, comic process.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:90%
So that was pretty heavy for me.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:26.894 align:middle line:84%
And then I met
Being 6 and realized

00:27:26.894 --> 00:27:34.060 align:middle line:84%
that the feeling of being so
alone and being so isolated

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and being nothing more
than just a universe inside

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:84%
of emptiness that has
nobody else themselves

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:90%
is just an illusion.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And there is-- we are
all one, but the beauty

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
is all those diversity and
all those possibilities

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:03.910 align:middle line:84%
of communication and connecting
and inspiring itself.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:84%
That is something that not
only lifted me up, but also

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.960 align:middle line:84%
influenced the way the
communication with the Greys

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.830 align:middle line:90%
turned out.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And we are talking
about that later.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I think that is the whole
beauty of the universe that

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:27.010 align:middle line:84%
wants to be social, wants to
be with others, and feel that.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And it also has some
practical meaning,

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:35.240 align:middle line:84%
because the Greys are not
that much into socializing

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.270 align:middle line:84%
They do not tend to feel that
as much as humans, for example,

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.880 align:middle line:84%
But the opportunity to that
is when the universe thinks

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.270 align:middle line:84%
that it's a closed
system, then it only

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:84%
reproduces its own
information, which is a lot,

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:58.040 align:middle line:84%
but we'll come to a
dead end at some time.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:84%
When you realize that
there is something outside,

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.950 align:middle line:84%
then you can obtain
information from somewhere,

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and you can go that direction,
and a whole new universe

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:90%
appears in front of itself.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And that brings possible
infinity to the universe.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And that still
needs to be proven,

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.710 align:middle line:90%
but it will take some time.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.418 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you feel
there's a connection

00:29:23.418 --> 00:29:27.190 align:middle line:84%
between the groups like the
Templars and the ETs, Tim?

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So very far back, like
a decade ago or something,

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a lot of
research, commissioned

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:41.550 align:middle line:90%
research on the Templars.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is when this
program came into contact

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:56.560 align:middle line:84%
with another being
that appeared--

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.640 align:middle line:84%
so there are beings that
live on the surface of light

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:07.060 align:middle line:84%
like humans do, but light has
also a dimension to go into it.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.120 align:middle line:90%
It's like water.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Inside of light, there are
many, many, many other species

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:84%
that are living literally
inside of the light.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And this species that
I'm talking about

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:26.700 align:middle line:84%
found it very important to let
us know that they influenced

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.290 align:middle line:90%
the Templars.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They appeared
inside of the light.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.770 align:middle line:90%
You can see them.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:35.280 align:middle line:84%
They were wearing
those white coats.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.750 align:middle line:84%
They also had greyish
skin and huge heads.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But different to the
Greys and other species,

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:84%
they looked-- and they had
this red cross upon their robe.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars at that time
seemed to have received contact

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:90%
from those beings.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.620 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to go
into much more details,

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:84%
because I want to give some
institutions on this planet

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:11.570 align:middle line:84%
the chance and the opportunity
to speak for themselves.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, some people
believe that contact and UFO

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:84%
phenomena is the new religion
that we're transitioning into.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts on that?

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I think
that religion will

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:27.660 align:middle line:90%
alter in some way or another.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that people
on this Earth who

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:37.055 align:middle line:84%
are in charge of some
things have taken that

00:31:37.055 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:90%
into consideration.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I still think-- and
that is also the opinion

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.580 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of extraterrestrials
that observed and did research

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:55.060 align:middle line:84%
on religion on this planet,
that the light of hope

00:31:55.060 --> 00:32:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and of awareness and good
thoughts that are coming

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:04.510 align:middle line:84%
from religions, this is
something that humanity

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.910 align:middle line:90%
is benefiting a lot from.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:11.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that the mystical
experience of oneness

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.590 align:middle line:84%
will become more important
in the future for everyone.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And I've also learned that
through religious belief--

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.100 align:middle line:84%
so we're talking
about ascension a lot,

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.200 align:middle line:84%
which means bringing
consciousness

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.630 align:middle line:90%
into another realm of awareness.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And religion is
something that has

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.400 align:middle line:84%
helped beneficial,
non-terrestrial beings that

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:39.830 align:middle line:84%
are serving as guides
and guiding souls

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.210 align:middle line:84%
into another experience,
that has helped them a lot

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:48.380 align:middle line:84%
to create the images that
are necessary in order

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:54.412 align:middle line:90%
to make it peaceful and gently.

00:32:54.412 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And for
our last question,

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.930 align:middle line:84%
do you believe open contact
will be a threat to religions

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.200 align:middle line:90%
as we know them?

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: No, I don't think that.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
perception of religion

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:90%
will shift in some way.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I also think that when we're
talking about technologies

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and all the ways reality
or lifestyle on Earth

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:84%
has already changed since,
I don't know, 1500s,

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:28.970 align:middle line:84%
then we can see that people
are adapting to that.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I think the
perception of religion

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:84%
will adapt to the personal
reality of all the people.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:39.790 align:middle line:84%
The connection to the
universe will be more deepened

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and new opportunities
will occur.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So all the things people are
looking for in the outside

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.190 align:middle line:90%
will appear in the outside.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Not only in the inside
when you meditate and have

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.070 align:middle line:84%
this connection, but you
will also see a difference

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.740 align:middle line:90%
in the shift of reality.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Wondrous things will happen.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Things will appear.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Reality will be more interesting
and more fascinating than ever.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that we
can all agree upon

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that the peace and
empathy that comes

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.750 align:middle line:84%
from being a religious
person is something

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.949 align:middle line:90%
we can all benefit from.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Tim, that was amazing.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.755 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you, Emery.

00:34:27.755 --> 00:34:32.639 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Till next time.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ANNOUNCER: Next on
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Traveling through
time is something

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.540 align:middle line:90%
that is very exclusive.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Time travel technology
seems to be something.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.909 align:middle line:84%
It's not in the mainstream, and
it's only very limited access.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:54.780 align:middle line:84%
At least the technology I am
aware of comes from the Greys.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Making humanity a
time traveling species

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:03.390 align:middle line:90%
is something that is pretty new.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:07.940 align:middle line:90%
