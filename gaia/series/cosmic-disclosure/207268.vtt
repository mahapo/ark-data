00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:10%
we're at an undisclosed
location with Tim.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.858 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you for having me.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, not
many people claim

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.720 align:middle line:84%
to have worked with
the Greys and have

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.210 align:middle line:84%
an ongoing relationship
like you do.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe for
us your first encounter

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:84%
with the extraterrestrials
known as the Greys?

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So some meetings were
with only one individual Grey.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Some were with up
to three of them.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Some other meetings
took place differently.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.970 align:middle line:84%
But the first one was me
sitting there and waiting

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:84%
what's happening and
freaking out in the moment

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
when a being slowly
approaches you, which

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.420 align:middle line:90%
is scary to say the least.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
The energy in the
room seems to change.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's also
what a lot of people

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
experience when they have
those encounters with Greys,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.200 align:middle line:84%
that they naturally feel
threatened, or naturally

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
feel scared, or a deep sense
of horror runs over the body.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a fresh hot
summer day and you

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:90%
go into an ice cold pool.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at some point
you enjoy the cold pool.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:90%
But the moment you get into--

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:84%
you're thrown into the cold
water, it's a shocking moment.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So that has always
been the case.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:84%
But the first time, it
was just me sitting there.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And then this being approached
me very slowly, very neutral,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, accordingly
to some kind of protocol.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I have this
kind of tablet device.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Before we
talk about the tablet,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:84%
tell me exactly what
you were seeing.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Could you physically
describe the Grey?

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: A lot of body features
are pretty different.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.690 align:middle line:84%
But the eyes stick
in your mind a lot.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they frontal
eyes or located to the side?

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Tear shaped or almond shaped?

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So they
are almond shaped.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Pretty darkish.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
that's a pupil.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I never did any
anatomy on something.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't say come
here and-- you know.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's a greyish,
whitish color of being.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:84%
The skin is-- it reminds me
kind of the skin of dolphins.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually a fiber
body, which is not that fleshy

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.250 align:middle line:90%
maybe as the meat of a dolphin.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And they also seem to have some
kind of film over the bodies,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:84%
which is transparent,
which seems

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.100 align:middle line:84%
to be some kind
of clothing, which

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:84%
might be just functional
because it appears to be naked.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.100 align:middle line:90%
It.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:90%
He or she.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Appears to be naked.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:84%
The Grey being, the puppet,
appears to be naked.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many digits
on the hands and feet?

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's four.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.860 align:middle line:90%
One thumb and three fingers.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No nostrils or lips?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, there are lips.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:90%
They do have lips.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:90%
They do not have a nose.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ears?

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: No ears.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:90%
No ears.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's standing or
sitting in front of you?

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Standing.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.239 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen
them sitting, actually.

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.568 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How do they walk?

00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's super smooth.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:90%
It's totally neutral.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Like, approaching that, no
looking left, no looking right.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.130 align:middle line:90%
It's just neutral.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
There's no pupils you can
see that are wandering.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So you'd never know if it's
looking at you, if it's

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
looking somewhere
else because it's

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.200 align:middle line:84%
an artificial
technology that you're

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:84%
interacting with with
a biological awareness.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell us about
the actual interaction.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, how
long did that last?

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I think because the
first meeting is all about

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
experiencing the stress and
the feeling that you have,

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:90%
it didn't take too long.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I imagine maybe like 15 minutes
to half an hour or something.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
The body needs some time
to get used to a frequency

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
just as when you get
put into cold water,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and the body needs like 10
minutes to adjust to that.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the same way that
your body and your mind

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
starts functioning
quite normally

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:90%
after 10 to 15 minutes.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Before that, it's just this
flight or fight response,

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.100 align:middle line:84%
where you want to just
run out of the room

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:84%
or scream totally in
horror or something.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you're sitting
in silence for a few minutes

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:84%
so you can adjust
energetically to the Grey?

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:90%
Because the body reacts.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Even if you know
what's going to happen,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:90%
your body is pumping adrenaline.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:90%
It's pumping your heart.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Blood it's going way up.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:90%
Your body is freaking out.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you're
on a roller coaster

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
without having any
bodily reaction at all.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
It might be if you're doing the
roller coaster a million times

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and that over a long term
that your body is bored

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.400 align:middle line:84%
to that experience and at some
point it's like, yeah, all

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
takes a long time.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And the body always
reacts to that.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Even when you're at
the cliff and you

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
want to jump into the water
and you know everything

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.420 align:middle line:84%
will be fine because
that's water.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It's still-- the body is
bringing you back and saying,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.590 align:middle line:90%
no, I don't want to jump that.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.640 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:90%
We're going to kill ourselves.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:90%
No, don't do that.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:90%
And that is something that is--

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:84%
it takes a while
to overcome that.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And I went through deep fear
and deep horror and stuff

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:90%
for a month.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Did you talk?

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Did you have telepathic
communication?

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
How did that
interaction play out?

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I felt that there's
some sincere interest.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:84%
You can sense that there
is a individual soul

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
or an individual
consciousness inside that

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:84%
is communicating with
you that has at times

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:90%
deep emotions about things.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:84%
At other times, it
doesn't react the way

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:84%
you're used to see
people react emotionally

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:90%
at some topics or something.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you remember what
you were trying to project?

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Were you conscious of your own
body language or expressions?

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.410 align:middle line:84%
What was that
moment like for you?

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The fear is a huge
part of it for a long time.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:84%
The most important
question, of course,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:90%
is, what's their agenda?

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.050 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Are they a threat?

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, I'm here
in a diplomatic way.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:90%
But do they sense that?

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Do they know that?

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:84%
Until at some point you start
to get into conversation, which

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
means getting
answers in some way

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and then analyzing
and feeling and going

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:84%
back and forth with information
until you have something.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So this was
a process over time.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And you had multiple
encounters once you

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:90%
got accustomed to the Greys.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: No, I have had countless
encounters with Grey beings.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:90%
Countless.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.630 align:middle line:90%
On different occasions.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Different-- Yeah.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Different information levels
that they showed me, gave me.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: At what point where
you communicating together?

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And what was that
communication about?

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I'm leaving out
a lot of the trauma work

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:90%
that I have done upon myself.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, one
key moment for me

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:84%
was to realize that
we are all connected.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a friendly
approach to understanding

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:90%
a different part of ourselves.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that helped
me a lot at that moment.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened,
communication changed a lot.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And I also think
that a lot of people

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
that had encounters with
Grey aliens or aliens

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:84%
in general, when they have come
to a point where they realize

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:84%
nothing bad happened and maybe
it's an interesting experience,

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:84%
we can learn, we can help,
we can grow together,

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:84%
then something projects from
the heart and maybe things

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:90%
are different.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What were
the first words

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:90%
that were actually spoken?

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I've rarely
heard them speak.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:84%
They were using
this kind of tablet

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
that has hieroglyphics
on the top side

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:90%
and German words on the bottom.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:10%
I think there are many different
versions of written language

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.610 align:middle line:10%
that the Greys use.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:84%
At some cases, they were
using this written hieroglyphs

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that appear on the
screen that is somehow

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:84%
connected to the awareness of
the person that is using that.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:84%
They are also using telepathic
thoughts based communication.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
hieroglyphs and different sets

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.950 align:middle line:84%
of an alphabet
that the Greys are

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:90%
using in different situations.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You suggest
that it interacts

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:84%
like an individual and
not a collective or hive

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Is this correct?

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Almost.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the best one
can describe it

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.510 align:middle line:84%
compared to the human
experience of awareness.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:02.130 align:middle line:84%
It has at least a level three
consciousness and level four

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:90%
consciousness of the Greys.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And they all exist
at the same time.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's different than
the human experience.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And they have to make
their way up the line.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:84%
But the highest
consciousness is also

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:84%
the most successful and stable
master line of the Greys.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's giving information
down to the Greys.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So while and they pointed
that out very clearly,

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:84%
everyone in the
system of the Greys

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
is free to choose
every experience

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and do whatever they
want in order also

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:84%
to gain credits, which is
their kind of monetary system.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
But the vision of
the species, the

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
where are we heading
as a collective, that

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:84%
is given down from one specific
being, which is one master

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.520 align:middle line:90%
line.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And they have three
of these master lines

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
in order to protect the
stability and the success

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:90%
of the whole community.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Would it
be correct to say

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:84%
they're free-thinking
individual souls like us,

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.460 align:middle line:84%
but their body has had
modifications to where it

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:90%
is now a more synthetic being?

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So if we're thinking about this
triad of body, mind, and soul,

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:84%
the body is clearly
synthetic and artificial.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:42.090 align:middle line:84%
They got rid of the biological
part of this triad, which

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:84%
brings advantages, but
also is not natural and has

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.630 align:middle line:84%
a lot of problems
to it in the way

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:84%
natural evolution is thought
to be, whatever that means.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the soul
level, which actually describes

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:84%
something as a container
system for all your previous,

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and future, and
present experiences,

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:84%
that kind of kicks in when
a consciousness unit is

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:84%
ready to develop a soul
and also when it's not

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:84%
evolved enough to take
consciousness and willing

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:29.940 align:middle line:84%
decisions in accordance to the
trials of those conditions.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
The soul level might
be a little different

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:84%
because they commit themselves
to a master line, which

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
means that the most successful
collective soul, which is not

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
quite accurate, but describes
it a little bit more,

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:84%
is the one that gives
down information

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:90%
on every consciousness unit.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
the consciousness part,

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and the awareness, and
the individuality of one

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Grey might be pretty similar
to what people on Earth

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing because some
previous humans have already

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:84%
decided to go from a
human experience directly

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.890 align:middle line:90%
to a Grey experience.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
The Greys, they do
have a consciousness,

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:84%
an individual biological
awareness just as humans have,

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and even some kind
of personality

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:84%
because most of their
consciousness units

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:84%
has made some different other
experiences on other planets

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.610 align:middle line:84%
in other dimensions
in other realities.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And they decide to commit
and to dedicate themselves

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:90%
to the Grey system.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say if you're
talking about an android,

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:09.300 align:middle line:84%
this is a being that is
computerized and not having

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.160 align:middle line:84%
a individual personality,
while the Greys only

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:20.760 align:middle line:84%
decided to eliminate the
biological bodies and presence

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.380 align:middle line:84%
in order to have artificial
bodies that they can maintain

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:84%
or substitute in whatever
form and way they want.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did the
Greys have recreation?

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.480 align:middle line:90%
What do they like to do for fun?

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Every individual
consciousness unit of the Greys

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
is free to express themselves
in the way they want.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So they can go to any place,
any planet, whatever they want.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have a
lot of human experience.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And if they think
it's their sole wish

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:84%
to experience
music or something,

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:84%
they can go to that experience
because they are free inside

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:90%
of the system of the Greys.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:90%
It is an authoritarian system.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:19.920 align:middle line:84%
They have that vision that
you must be dedicated to,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty loose mission--

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
vision, which
means just means we

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:84%
want the most stable
and successful evolution

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.490 align:middle line:84%
for the whole universe
and for the Grey system.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And however you want
to do the mission,

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:84%
you can do it however
you want to do it.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.385 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to take
off time and, I don't know,

00:17:44.385 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:84%
have an experience on Earth to
do whatever you want, to listen

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:84%
to music or something because
you think that enriches

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:84%
your own experience
in the universe,

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:90%
then you're free to do that.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:84%
You might not get a
lot of credit for that.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And credits are important
in the Grey system

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:84%
in order to purchase
technology that might help you

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:90%
for a greater mission.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So if there is an
important mission

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
for them like, for example,
administer a certain planet

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:84%
or even administer a whole
star system or something,

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:32.220 align:middle line:84%
you might need a whole fleet of
craft, and a lot of warriors,

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of, I don't
know, whatever you want.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.530 align:middle line:90%
And that you have to purchase.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
the credits when

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:90%
you start in the Grey system.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
You only have the credits
for one of those bodies.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you break that,
you need another one

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.810 align:middle line:84%
because your soul
gets-- or your awareness

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:84%
gets extracted from that back to
the headquarters of the Greys.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can then use
the credit system

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.300 align:middle line:84%
in order to get another
of those puppet bodies

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:90%
to go on another mission.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And you might want to have
another craft or something.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.850 align:middle line:90%
So you have to purchase that.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:90%
You need the credit.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:84%
If you want a
whole fleet and you

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:84%
want to be the officer
for the whole fleet,

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
purchase the whole fleet.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you break that,
you have to start again.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's not about
the ability they have,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:84%
but the credits they accumulate
before going on a mission?

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:30.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like you have all
these kind of missions

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
in the headquarter of the Greys
where they say, oh, that planet

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle line:84%
is interesting to us because
it has a very high probability

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle line:84%
to evolve into a
stable timeline where

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:84%
when we have our
genetic material

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and our evolutionary
material in there,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
we can also benefit from
their evolution a lot.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So that planet is
important to us.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
It might give you
that big amount

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:90%
of credits when you succeed.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:90%
So you get credits.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And with that credits, you
can buy whatever technology

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:90%
the Greys are producing.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And with the
technology, you enhance

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.070 align:middle line:84%
the chances to be
successful in the mission.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:18.570 align:middle line:10%
And that also determines
the master line of the Greys

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:10%
because the master of
one line of the Greys

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:10%
has the most credits.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a capitalistic
system in a way.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's also super linked
to the vision of the Greys,

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:90%
which makes it productive.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And that master line
who has the most credits

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:50.900 align:middle line:84%
has the final end game
mission going on right now.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And he's spending the
credits he has in order

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:90%
to purchase everything down.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: This is
fascinating information

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
because on Earth,
regardless of your job,

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
it's based on your
ability and capacity.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:84%
What I'm hearing is if
I pay enough credits,

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I can get the job
or the mission?

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: No.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is the
Grey system still

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.490 align:middle line:84%
benefits from talent, personal
preference, diversity,

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and the sole factor
of personality.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.770 align:middle line:84%
If you have two
people on Earth that

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:33.240 align:middle line:84%
go to the same medical school
and they both study medicine,

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:84%
then two people might be
very different doctors.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:84%
One might be a much better
healer than the other one,

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.550 align:middle line:84%
which is not only
the education, it

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:84%
comes to the
personal preference.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And we see that in the universe
a lot by the way personality

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:84%
is built and
constructed that we have

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:84%
people that can be
the best version

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:90%
at some place in the universe.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But the Greys prefer
and benefit from people

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.040 align:middle line:84%
that do things where
they're good at

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.825 align:middle line:90%
and where their interest is.

00:22:21.825 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
If someone is dedicating
their sole mission

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and their sole path
to the Grey system,

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:37.380 align:middle line:84%
they do not need to be
part of big missions.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:84%
They could also do something in
the broader mass of everything.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So if someone from
Earth, for example,

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.820 align:middle line:84%
is interested in healing
work or something

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and they decide to go to
this kind of Grey system

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and get extracted from the
body and get put into the Grey

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:09.030 align:middle line:84%
community, they still can do
every healing and medicinal

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:84%
mission that they have
in their headquarters.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:17.970 align:middle line:84%
They will probably
receive less amount

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.440 align:middle line:90%
of credits for what they do.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
They could also just enjoy
life or do whatever they want,

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:31.170 align:middle line:84%
just incarnate somewhere
and listen to music all day

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and just relax or do
something like that

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:90%
if that is what they want.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
But they will not
receive as much credit,

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:84%
probably none of it, for the
overall vision of the Greys.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you feel like you
have a tactical understanding

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and you're interested in
administrational stuff

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:84%
or governmental stuff
or something like that,

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:84%
you might want to go
to a huge mission which

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.050 align:middle line:90%
is worthy to the Greys.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you succeed and
only when you succeed,

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.180 align:middle line:84%
you get a lot of
credit for that.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
credit for that,

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:84%
you get promoted
automatically when

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:90%
you succeed at that mission.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But probably if someone
hasn't got enough credits

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:84%
to buy the stuff they
need to succeed for that--

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:84%
so just imagining a military
mission or something,

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.520 align:middle line:90%
you need a whole fleet.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And you need a lot of warriors
and a lot of stuff to do that.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
take on that mission

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.230 align:middle line:84%
without having
any credit at all.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:50.135 align:middle line:84%
But you probably will fail,
and you will get no credit.

00:24:50.135 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:90%
So there's no promotion chance.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you suggesting
that a military mission

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:84%
is determined by who has
the most credits accumulated

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.970 align:middle line:84%
over the best
strategist, for example?

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The more
credits you have,

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
the more the overall
vision of the master

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.620 align:middle line:90%
line moves into your direction.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:84%
If one has a lot
of credits, he's

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.760 align:middle line:84%
pretty high in the position
of the Grey community.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And he can determine a lot
how the whole species go to

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:90%
or how they evolve.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And at the top position
of this lineage,

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.850 align:middle line:84%
you have one individual
that gives down everything.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a pyramid scheme.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And they have three
of these in order

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:84%
to ensure that if one fails,
they have two back ups that

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.840 align:middle line:90%
reach back and rebuild it.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's 100% successful.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: At the top of this
pyramid power structure,

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:84%
is it the most intelligent
leader at the top?

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Or is it the person
with the most credits?

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It is the person
with the most credits.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So if Earth
is a pyramid structure,

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.950 align:middle line:84%
would Elon Musk and Jeff
Bezos be at the top?

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: If Earth would have--

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
so first of all, I think
that the economic system

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
that we have on
Earth is something

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.710 align:middle line:90%
that people have from the Greys.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.020 align:middle line:90%
We see that a lot--

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.270 align:middle line:84%
for example, the
World Trade Centers,

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:84%
they used to be
aligned with Orion.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:38.960 align:middle line:84%
We have the Orion Center,
which is referring to Orion.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think there are a lot of
references to the Orion star

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:51.490 align:middle line:84%
system, which might be evidence
that the economical system,

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.160 align:middle line:84%
the capitalism that
we have on Earth,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:84%
is something that is inspired
by the way the Greys do it.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The Grey system
combines the economics

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:10.840 align:middle line:84%
with the overall vision
and the hierarchical system

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:90%
of the society.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.700 align:middle line:84%
While we have a lot
of mass on Earth,

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:84%
which means someone who
has a lot of dollars

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:84%
doesn't need to be the most
productive man on Earth

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:30.790 align:middle line:84%
for bringing humanity
forward, while that being,

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:84%
that individual in the
hierarchy of the Greys

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:84%
that has the most credits
is the most stable timeline

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:84%
on their master line and is
like dictating everything down

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.940 align:middle line:84%
because that is the one who
everyone else follows in order

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:84%
to have the most stable
evolution in the universe.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, that
was great information.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.867 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:28:08.867 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Most common are two types
of lizard or reptilian kind

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:18.610 align:middle line:90%
of beings.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:22.270 align:middle line:84%
When they appear on Earth,
they try to do it covertly.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:84%
They kind of can move the
appearance of their skin

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.600 align:middle line:90%
into the direction they want.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Some come from a totally
different reality.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Others come from
different planets.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.840 align:middle line:90%
They all have their own agenda.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:47.000 align:middle line:90%
