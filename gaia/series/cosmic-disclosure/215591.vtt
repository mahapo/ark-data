00:00:20.318 --> 00:00:22.110 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:10%
we are with Sébastien Martin,
a retired chairman of the board

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:10%
of a multinational business
who has participated in covert

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:10%
remote viewing assignments
for CIA analysts.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking about
the hybrid programs of the SSP.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Sébastian, welcome.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SÉBASTIEN MARTIN: Thank
you very much for having me

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:90%
on the show.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now you're aware
and you mentioned to me,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
you know about these hybrid
programs that are run

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.657 align:middle line:90%
by the SSP.

00:00:44.657 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell me about that?

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So I was told that the SSP have
used hybrids for generations.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.840 align:middle line:90%
So it's not new to them.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was explained
how those hybrids

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
were enhanced, so, changed,
modified to suit their needs.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it
physical or genetic?

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:90%
You said manipulate.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So most of the
hybrids, they have human DNA,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:84%
but they're also mixed
in with alien DNA.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.200 align:middle line:90%
So they are definitely hybrids.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm saying that
is because, like human DNA,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.870 align:middle line:84%
we can trace back our origins
from like, being in Italian,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:90%
European or whatever.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:84%
It works exactly the
same way for alien DNA.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you have, let's
say, one particular hybrid

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:84%
who has the tendencies
of being more,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
let's say on the
Draco side, then

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian
components are enhanced

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:90%
to reach certain targets.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, when the SSP
has to go on a mission

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
to fight against
the Dracos, they

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:84%
would use cloaking, same as
what the Draco used themselves

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:84%
to mimic their own appearance
to get on rescue missions,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And they are using those kind
of hybrids soldiers to do that.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Then you have hybrids
who stay on earth,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:84%
who basically would just be
part of a specific project.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And those hybrids
are full humans,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:84%
but they were usually
from generations.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So both their
parents are humans,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
but they do have
alien markers in them

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.430 align:middle line:84%
that are also being enhanced
to do specific jobs, and most

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:84%
likely to do with communication
on earth with alien beings

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:90%
to achieve certain jobs.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How do they find the
lineage of these people that you

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.320 align:middle line:84%
say that are picked specifically
for these hybrid programs?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.528 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, like I say,
it's been going on since

00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
the '50s, for some of
those from the '30s.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's been going
on for a while.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So the majority of the hybrids
they are using through the SSP

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.520 align:middle line:90%
are human beings.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:84%
They are human-based beings who
have been enhanced, changed,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
or modified to
achieve their targets.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
The men in black, who is
actually part of the SSP,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:90%
do have hybrids within them.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And those beings are
completely non-humans.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So they are using genomes
or human DNA to create them,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
but they are actually
made in a lab.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.390 align:middle line:84%
They are not
automatically produced

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:84%
through the conception, natural
conception as we know it.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.080 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of different.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are there any type
of-- do they undergo any type

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:90%
of implantation or surgeries?

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, yes they do.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.480 align:middle line:84%
The majority of the hybrids
that work for the SSP,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
they have a different
use of implants.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's what we
call ethereal implants.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And then there is the
physical implants.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So the ethereal implants are
more to do with funny enough,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
with the veracity, let's say,
the origin of those hybrids

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that they're
not being corrupted,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that they can track them
from their alien race,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:84%
while the physical implants
are used to track them

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and also to enhance them
for certain abilities.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So especially to do
with frequencies.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's like more of
a frequency generator,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:84%
so they can do more telepathy
with certain ET races and so on.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you ever heard
of those implants or the actual

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:90%
hybrid being hacked or hijacked?

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it happens.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Maybe you
could talk about that.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So some
of the hybrids,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:84%
especially through the physical
and antithyroid implants,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
have been hijacked by the Kruger
Group working for the SSP,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.760 align:middle line:84%
because they had a way to modify
those hybrids and even get

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.200 align:middle line:90%
information from them.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
They were doing
remote influencing.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Like morphogenic
field, etheric field,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.910 align:middle line:90%
or is it from a satellite or?

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: No, not
from a satellite?

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.150 align:middle line:84%
No, that's usually using
the Draco race directly

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:90%
to target those beings.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much yes.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
But they were able to modify
the use of those implants

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:84%
so they could just use
it to their benefit.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now have they changed
that so the Dracos and--

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: They
modify them, yes.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: --they
can't do that anymore?

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: It's
been changed since.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tell us a little bit
about the life of a hybrid.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Are they specific
just for the facility?

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Do they have family?

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:90%
Or do they live off base?

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about them.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So for one, if we're
talking about men in black type

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:84%
of hybrid, those guys don't
venture in the daylight and then

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.730 align:middle line:84%
start having a normal life,
while the hybrids that are

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
working for the SSP
look like you and me.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And they have a different
energy about them,

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:84%
but they have normal
functional lives.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Very rarely they have families.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Some do.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And they want them
to because they

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:90%
want to have a lineage again.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's very hard for
them to have families

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.860 align:middle line:84%
because what they go
through psychically,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very challenging
and difficult for them

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
to even contemplate
having a family.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.683 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Overwhelming
emotion and energy floods.

00:06:00.683 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you mean?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Not just that, but
also what they're involved in.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
they don't know

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
if they're going to
be living tomorrow,

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:84%
because their life
could also be in danger.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
They face a lot of
challenges that we don't

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:90%
face on a day-to-day basis.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So the SSP is very
demanding of these hybrids?

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And they have to do
what they say or they'll kill

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Maybe, but it's more
to do with they have a target.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
They said, you
have to, let's say,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:84%
build a facility in one country,
it has to be done tomorrow.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.620 align:middle line:90%
You have to start doing.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what you do.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:84%
This is your job, and
you have to do it.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And they can't say no.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, how are they
finding the person that needs

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
to become the hybrid or a hybrid
that needs to be upregulated?

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Like, how do they--

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: How do
they find them?

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.988 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yeah, how do they
find them, pick them out?

00:06:51.988 --> 00:06:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So basically, once
you are in the same gene pool

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:90%
as those hybrids--

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:84%
is from like family
members to family members.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:84%
So they know how
to track them down

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and how to train them
from very early on.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.180 align:middle line:84%
The parents have to be open
with their own children

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:90%
about what they're involved in.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:84%
So they are being familiarized
with the environment

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:90%
they are growing up in.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And then there are some
kids that are like,

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
especially orphans who are
being taken for those programs

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.270 align:middle line:90%
to become hybridized.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So they modify them to achieve
a certain purpose as well.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And those beings are sent off,
usually to a place in the Rocky

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Mountains in Canada.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.815 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about this facility.

00:07:38.815 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell about it?

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I can say that
you can't see it from space

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:90%
or from--

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:84%
even if you were like
right opposite it,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:84%
you could not even
see the entryway.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
completely cloaked.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:84%
The entryway basically is
like a-- it's a rock face.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:90%
And it opens up.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a mirage.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not even there.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But that's the entryway
for that facility

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:90%
down into the mountains.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can't reach
it by road either.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So, how
do you get there?

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Is it like a--

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Usually through
a-- usually like vehicles.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Like from what-- where
are the entrances to this area?

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And are there portals there?

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Everything that's
in that facility are not using

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:90%
human-made vehicles.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:90%
It's all SSP related and crafts.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So those crafts can go deep
down into the core of the earth

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.809 align:middle line:84%
and accessing different
tunnels and accessing

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:84%
different countries
from there, too.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So does the SSP
have the technology to go

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional?

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I mean, if they can
go to inner earth and back,

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, then they've conquered
time travel and everything?

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Oh, yes.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:51.818 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they've done everything.

00:08:51.818 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So this is a
very advanced facility.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.948 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yes,
very, very advanced.

00:08:55.948 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: And they only--

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: One of the most
advanced facilities in the world

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.410 align:middle line:90%
for the SSP.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very
security guarded.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it like a square
mile or a couple acres?

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.967 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how big the size is
under in the mountain, I guess?

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: It's in the
mountain, and it's massive.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
It goes deep underground, pretty
much like all secret facilities

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:90%
that you know about.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: But to
access those tunnels,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
you have to imagine that
you can imagine speed trains

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:29.690 align:middle line:84%
in underground tunnels,
those facilities use crafts,

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:90%
vehicles to go down the shafts.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine a circular
UFO or craft going all the way

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
down as a transportation
vehicle to go all the way down

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to the speed train and
then to dispatch whoever

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.230 align:middle line:90%
has to go to different tunnels.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Where do the workers
get into the speed train?

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:90%
From where?

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:90%
From DC?

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:90%
From where?

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.820 align:middle line:90%
From a base?

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: From
all over the world.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: All over?

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: All over the world,
not just Canada or the US.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And that's one of
how many bases do they have?

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.055 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I don't
know for sure.

00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
But all I know is that
some of the tunnels

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle line:84%
leaving the mountains
in the Rockies, which

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.430 align:middle line:84%
is close to Calgary, they
go all the way to Europe.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.803 align:middle line:84%
So underground and
through the ocean.

00:10:18.803 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what else do
they do in this facility?

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you did mention
the hybrid program.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Are they doing anything else?

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: I don't know.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:26.600 align:middle line:90%
That I don't know.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if they--

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I know that they enhance
and manipulate children

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:84%
there, too, to make them like
soldiers or workers, technicians

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to imagine
that some of these facilities

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
use technology that we don't
use on earth regularly.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, all
the contractors,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.420 align:middle line:84%
all the technicians,
all or the workers

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.870 align:middle line:84%
are there physically touching
and using technologies

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:90%
that we're not familiar with.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So they can't just use anybody
to even construct those places.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:90%
And they don't use aliens.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So they're using
hybrids for that.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the technology that they
are physically manipulating

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:84%
is something that
could potentially

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.010 align:middle line:84%
harm us as regular humans,
but it doesn't harm them.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So for just basic
components like that,

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.580 align:middle line:84%
you need to use hybrids
and not regular humans.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How long has
that facility been there?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: I don't know.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But I would say it's probably
been there since probably

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.900 align:middle line:90%
the '60s.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And when was the first
documented hybrid on planet

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:90%
Earth?

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that,
that you're aware of?

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I think that the
hybridization program started

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:90%
in the '70s or early '70s.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So do these hybrids
actually reside and live in this

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.640 align:middle line:90%
facility?

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:84%
From let's say, two
years or three years old,

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.660 align:middle line:84%
those children are being
bred and educated on site.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:84%
They don't know regular
lives, like we do.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:90%
They stay there until they--

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.260 align:middle line:84%
some of them stay
there until they die.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.337 align:middle line:84%
So their work is to
stay at that facility.

00:12:02.337 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, how
did you come about,

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Sébastien and finding
out about this facility?

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And was it like a
mission, another mission

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:90%
you had to do or?

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So from Jamie's,
my SSP contact, I

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:84%
was able to know more
about the mountain

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and the facility and what
was happening within it.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why do you have an
SSP contact in the first place?

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.255 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, through the
work I was doing as a remote

00:12:22.255 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:84%
viewer, I automatically got
involved in some missions that

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.490 align:middle line:84%
kind of intertwined with the
CIA and the SSP because some

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.100 align:middle line:84%
of these agents were
working some close missions.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
why those agents

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:41.030 align:middle line:84%
were able to talk to
certain SSP agents.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
also working for the CIA

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:90%
and some other agencies.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So they already know
each other by name.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:52.235 align:middle line:84%
So when they mentioned, I said,
yeah, I worked for the SSP.

00:12:52.235 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Like, you could just come
up in a in a discussion.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:90%
And they won't elaborate.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.438 align:middle line:84%
They won't go into details
unless there's a reason for it.

00:13:01.438 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How many hybrids do
you think are out there in this

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:84%
program or that the program
released since the '60s?

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's in
the thousands so far.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:84%
But from what I understand, it's
more and more as time goes by,

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.400 align:middle line:84%
because I think deep down
what the SSP wishes to do

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and what other
programs wish to do,

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.480 align:middle line:84%
is to have a full integration of
the alien race within the earth

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.340 align:middle line:84%
so we can have a
better acceptance

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:84%
for whatever technologies
that they can bring forward

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:90%
as part of our new reality.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Integration,
a great word.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you used that.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And why do you think
they're doing that?

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: To help us evolve,
which is not a natural way.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
we are also faced

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:84%
with potential changes of
whatever is in the cosmos

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.120 align:middle line:90%
that we are not prepared for.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And the SSP knows
about those beings.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.618 align:middle line:84%
And so they want us to
be prepared and safe.

00:13:58.618 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's very positive.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.825 align:middle line:84%
So they want us to integrate
and have a safe transition

00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.133 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: That's correct.

00:14:05.133 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So there are these
hybrids that we're aware of that

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:84%
actually come from, either
a human or a hybrid mother,

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
where the eggs are manipulated
before the baby in vitro gets

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.620 align:middle line:84%
dowsed with whatever
for the mutation.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Is there a connection between
this organic process and the SSP

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:90%
hybrid program?

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes and no.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So some of these hybrids
are, like we talked about,

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.050 align:middle line:90%
made or enhanced on earth.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And some others are produced in
space and then brought to earth.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's a facility the SSP
has up there in a mothership

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.785 align:middle line:90%
Or is it on the moon?

00:14:45.785 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Not the SSP, no.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.330 align:middle line:90%
The Kruger Group does.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The Kruger
Group has one?

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:50.928 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yeah,
on the mothership.

00:14:50.928 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:90%
It's done in space.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not done on a
physical location.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:90%
And I remote viewed those.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.397 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What did you
see on that mothership?

00:14:59.397 --> 00:15:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Those beings
were tall, Grey aliens.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:90%
And they were white.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they were Grey
aliens that looked white?

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.035 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:06.290 align:middle line:90%
A big head and tall?

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: And they were tall.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.730 align:middle line:90%
And they were tall.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:84%
No those, I will refer
to them as scientists.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Their sole job was to
experiment on abductees

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and taking some of
the stuff from them

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.720 align:middle line:90%
to produce those hybrids.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very nefarious
program in a way.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But those beings
are working in line

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.110 align:middle line:84%
with the Kruger organization
to bring those hybrids back

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:90%
on earth.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's very novel
in a way, not novel,

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.902 align:middle line:84%
but it's different
from what the SSP does.

00:15:39.902 --> 00:15:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I see
what you're saying.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:90%
Is there any joint work?

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Is it just those tall
whites that are doing it?

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Or are there other
extraterrestrials

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.832 align:middle line:90%
involved with that?

00:15:47.832 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I don't
know about that.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:53.740 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that the SSP does
conduct their own experiments,

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.670 align:middle line:84%
but they don't abduct
people through spacecraft

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.380 align:middle line:90%
to bring them into space.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:90%
That's not their job.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:90%
That's not what they do.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you talked
about the SSP hybrid program,

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:90%
the Kruger hybrid program.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a lot of
guests on here talking

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:90%
about an ET hybrid program.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, what do you
think about that?

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And what's the agenda
between the three?

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I don't think that
the ET program per se exists.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:84%
I think it's all related to the
groups organizations on earth,

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
because it's easier for them to
work with humans to integrate

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:84%
those humans on earth or
those hybrids on earth.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any sense for me
to have just an ET race coming

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:84%
up with their own
hybridization program

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and then sending off those
random hybrids onto earth

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
by themselves with zero
affiliations whatsoever

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:90%
with anything.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Why would they do that?

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Who would they
respond to, work for?

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: There's no--

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: There's no link
to anything that's already

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.710 align:middle line:90%
on earth.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.902 align:middle line:90%
Those ETs know about the SSP.

00:16:53.902 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:84%
They know about the
Kruger organizations.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Why would they want to be
singled out and coming up

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
with their own program
to send hybrids on earth?

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:90%
It makes zero sense to me.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So the hybrids,
humans, or extraterrestrials,

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:84%
all these beings, are
they working for the SSP?

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Or are they working for Kruger?

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.338 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: They choose.

00:17:16.338 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about a
galactic federation or alliance.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.589 align:middle line:84%
Those beings are part
of the same group.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So they therefore help a
certain group of people

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:84%
on earth based on
the technologies

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:90%
that they are currently using.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's all to do with
reverse engineering programs.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the Kruger group have
been working with the Dracos.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.030 align:middle line:84%
It's very complex
because to that extent,

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:84%
there's comes some
kind of worshipping

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.890 align:middle line:84%
going on there,
because the Dracos want

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.440 align:middle line:84%
to be worshiped and
perceived as gods

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:90%
and overseeing and overpowering.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they do.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: They do?

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: But they try to give
some leeway to the people that

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:90%
they work with.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So they try to still make
them feel important and so on.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And then there are some other
groups who are, I would say,

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.780 align:middle line:84%
newer groups that are
aware of the Earth

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and decide to contact certain
members of the government

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.850 align:middle line:90%
or these things.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
understand the affiliations

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.382 align:middle line:84%
with the galactic federation
or alliance with Earth.

00:18:18.382 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore they're trying
to make their own contacts,

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:90%
sometimes with individuals too.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And then when they start talking
about their own experience,

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
they say, well, you are
like an experiencer.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really
understand where

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:84%
you come from because you have
your own set of characteristics

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and channeling going on
that we don't understand.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.260 align:middle line:84%
It's new to us, but that's
completely different from what

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.920 align:middle line:90%
is currently happening.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So we have ETs that
are working with the military,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
working with corporations,
working with governments,

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:90%
and individual contacts as well?

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.270 align:middle line:90%
So they're reaching out.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be everywhere.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:54.750 align:middle line:90%
But what is the agenda?

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And who's really the top dog on
the pyramid controlling this?

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, I would just
compare it to what we know best.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And you've got two major parties
usually fighting one another.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
independent parties and so on.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:90%
The ETs is pretty much the same.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.280 align:middle line:84%
If I can just
summarize it that way,

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.770 align:middle line:84%
it's much easier to understand
because the smaller groups will

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.260 align:middle line:84%
be contacting the
people individually.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:84%
They will contact members of
the government or corporations.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Those are the minor leagues.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the SSP and
Kruger organizations, which

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:90%
are the top dogs of the Earth.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And the beings that
they are working with

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.490 align:middle line:84%
are definitely on top of
the food chain, let's say.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.295 align:middle line:84%
And they are the ones to
control what's happening next.

00:19:44.295 --> 00:19:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mean, the
"Draco and serpents"?

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:46.755 align:middle line:90%
Anunnaki?

00:19:46.755 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: On the
Kruger side, yes.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: On the Kruger side?

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:90%
What about on the SSP side?

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: That's more
the Pleiadian side.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's Pleiadian?

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:90%
And the Arcturians and yeah.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So with all these
factions and competition going

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:84%
on with everyone, where do you
see this going in a few years?

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I know
it is evolving.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.490 align:middle line:84%
We'll be seeing lots
of changes in 2025.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:12.040 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, if
you ask anybody at the SSP,

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:84%
they will just tell
you, we can't tell you.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:90%
They don't even know themselves.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So they have an agenda,
but this is not something

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.530 align:middle line:90%
they are willing to discuss.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So, what's your final
takeaway on this, Sébastien?

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.060 align:middle line:84%
You've been exposed
to these programs.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:28.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well,
for one, personally,

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm definitely more in tune with
what is going on and the hopes

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:84%
that we can carry through the
integration process of learning

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:84%
from these technologies, also
through the different types

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:84%
of frequencies that
will be sent our way.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I think this is very important
for the evolution of mankind.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I do not see how
we could evolve naturally

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.410 align:middle line:84%
with the way the universe
is already progressing.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And if we wish to explore
and go on different journeys,

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:84%
if we want to send
humankind there,

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:84%
we have to be physically and
mentally prepared for that.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that can't
happen naturally.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
It has to be with a certain
level of evolution markers

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.240 align:middle line:90%
that we currently don't have.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, I'm sure
our audience wants to know,

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Sébastien, are you a hybrid?

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And what can you tell us?

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: What I can say
is my birth was different.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:84%
My mom was pregnant, and
she, after five or six weeks,

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:84%
she had a hemorrhage and
went to the hospital.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
the fetus is dying.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
But good news, there's
another one there.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:90%
I was conceived after the fact.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And it happens sometimes.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: But they had
to mummify the other fetus

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:54.930 align:middle line:84%
in the womb for nine
months for me to be born.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I was born, I
didn't have the first layer

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:90%
of my epidermis.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So the first layer of
my skin was not present.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.430 align:middle line:90%
How did you survive that?

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: It took six
months for my skin to grow.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.813 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's an
incredible story.

00:22:09.813 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So that's one
of the aspects of it.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And then when I turned two,
I could breathe in the air,

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:84%
but I could not no
longer exhale the air.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.970 align:middle line:90%
So I was suffocating on my CO2.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And they had to send
me away for six months.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was it your trachea
or lungs were not correct or?

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: The lungs.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And they sent me away to
the Pyrenees Mountains

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:84%
in France, where I was with
other children in a center,

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and to relearn how to breathe
in cold air and dry air

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:90%
in high altitude.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:84%
But the caveat was that
my parents were not

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:90%
allowed to see me.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Very odd.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: --when my father
picked me up and my mom came

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:84%
over to pick me up, and I was
in the car and in the back seat,

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and they always
recalled that event.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Hey,
friend, friend,"

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:84%
because I did not
recognize my family.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And so my dad turned
around and said,

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:90%
"Who is asking that question?"

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:90%
And it was just me--

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: All right.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.063 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: --speaking
with a Bernese accent.

00:23:07.063 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And I had to relearn how to
know my family, basically.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I didn't recognize anyone.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.813 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how old were
you when that happened?

00:23:14.813 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Between 2 and 3.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:90%
So I was just speaking.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:84%
They told me that there were
a bunch of scientists there.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
dog with other kids.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.510 align:middle line:84%
But the fact was that this
facility no longer exists

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.730 align:middle line:90%
and was there in the '70s.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting
because my family doctor

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:84%
suggested that place in the
first place to my parents.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And he was in my
family until he died.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.730 align:middle line:84%
But he recommended me
to go to that place.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.230 align:middle line:90%
And my mom didn't want to.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But they said, well, it's
either that or you will die.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you have any
additional exceptional abilities

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:84%
or dreams that you'd like to
share when you were growing up?

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, I was always
very intuitive growing up.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I used to go to class
and seeing things

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.100 align:middle line:84%
from my classmates or events
that were about to occur.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.308 align:middle line:84%
And I really didn't
know what to do with it.

00:24:07.308 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So I used to write them
down on a piece of paper.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:90%
And then I was being--

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that person especially
was angry at me

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:84%
for disclosing that and saying,
why are you saying that?

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And then the next year, she
had this scooter accident

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.260 align:middle line:84%
where the person who hit her
and made her a paraplegic--

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.040 align:middle line:84%
I saw her dead, but
she became paraplegic.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And the person who hit her
was the Spanish teacher

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I was in class with.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So I had that
vision in his class.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And I saw--

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow!

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: --a classmate
and him in that same vision,

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.360 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't recognize
him in the vision.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:84%
I could only see her
being hit by the car.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I did another
experiment, like I told you,

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I was doing breathing exercises
using transcendental meditation.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And through these breathing
exercises, normally you sit down

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:57.610 align:middle line:90%
and you meditate.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But I was actually
lying down on my bed.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And I came out of my body, and I
decided to go through a tunnel.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
hover over a nightstand

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and see the objects on
the nightstand of a girl

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.360 align:middle line:90%
that I fancied at the time.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And just to impress her,
because I was in a dorm,

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:17.700 align:middle line:90%
I was in a boarding school.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:90%
It was mixed.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.830 align:middle line:90%
And she was on her side.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.917 align:middle line:84%
And when I told her the next
day as part of an exercise,

00:25:23.917 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:84%
I told her, I said, "Place
one object on your nightstand

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.958 align:middle line:84%
and tomorrow I will
tell you what it is."

00:25:27.958 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And then she placed three, and
I described describe all three.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So the next day, I
told her about it

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and then she became all white,
didn't want to discuss it ever.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:84%
It took me probably
almost more than 20 years

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:44.100 align:middle line:84%
to extract it from her, because
I'm still in touch with her.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But she told me and
said, "The reason

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.937 align:middle line:84%
why I didn't want to
talk about it at the time

00:25:47.937 --> 00:25:50.670 align:middle line:84%
is because you saw that
necklace on my nightstand

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.065 align:middle line:84%
that my dad gave me before
he died in a car crash.

00:25:54.065 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And I never wore it at
school, but you described it

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:90%
exactly the way it was.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what spooked me,
because I was super religious."

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.897 align:middle line:90%
And so therefore, she--

00:26:01.897 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:90%
