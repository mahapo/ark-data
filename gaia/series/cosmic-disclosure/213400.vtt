>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.430 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.200 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.950 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Today we discuss
Project Nile Dawn.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.993 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY: Thank you,
Emery, Good to be here.

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is
operation Nile Dawn?

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It was an operation that
the United States government

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and the British government
formed many years ago

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
to examine the strange
occurrences that they determined

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and found at the different
pyramids in the Sudan and Egypt.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:84%
In 1928, a British Army
officer in the rank of Colonel,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Reginald Blumenthal was
exploring the pyramids

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, him and
a group of people.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:90%
And this was after World War I.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But there was some interests
by the German government

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:84%
back in those days
with those pyramids

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:90%
and what is now today, Sudan.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1928, Egypt was a colony
of the British government.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And during that time period,
Sudan was part of that colony.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.840 align:middle line:10%
Today, the country is
Sudan, a different country.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Blumenthal started
exploring the lower

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
part of the Nile area,
which is the Sudan,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:90%
and he found these pyramids.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:84%
They're all unnamed
back in those days.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Most of them were unexplored.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those pyramids
back in that 1928 era

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:90%
weren't finished.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
They were started, but
they never finished them.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:84%
So he got very interested
in these pyramids.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:84%
So his crew and him
started exploring.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And at one particular
pyramid, which was unnamed,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
he found an entrance that
went down underground.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:90%
And so he followed that.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And he went deeper and deeper
and found a tunnel system.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:84%
He thought that was very strange
because the little he knew

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
about pyramids was
that they were created

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.620 align:middle line:90%
centuries and centuries ago.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.130 align:middle line:90%
So he kept going and going.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he
found a flat area

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:90%
where something had occurred.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
He found, what he
thought were coffins,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.900 align:middle line:84%
some metal and some ceramic or
some other type of substance.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And he found some torches
that had been burnt.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And so as he started
exploring that area,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:84%
lighting some of these torches,
he found this ring, a big ring.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.590 align:middle line:10%
And didn't know
what it was, but saw

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:10%
this strange writing, these
strange symbols on this ring.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So then he, and another
person, walked through it

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.550 align:middle line:90%
to look at the other side.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and lo and behold, they got
into some other severe--

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.135 align:middle line:84%
as if they walked into
another dimension.

00:03:32.135 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And this
ring, so the audience

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.980 align:middle line:84%
knows, we're talking
like what diameter.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.275 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It's probably
25 feet in diameter.

00:03:39.275 --> 00:03:40.075 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:42.693 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And the sphere
was even larger than that.

00:03:42.693 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: As they
walked into it, it

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
was like a new world, as
he explained in his diary.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:90%
It was like a new world.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't
figure out how he

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
got from one place in
a closed sarcophagus

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:90%
almost, into this open area.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this a
portal of some sort?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, today we would
call it a portal or a stargate.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I think we would refer to
it today as a stargate.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Stargate.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But back in
those days, in 1928--

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They didn't know.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --it wasn't-- no.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know what it was.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.850 align:middle line:84%
But when he walked into it, it
was as if he was in a new world.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:84%
It was an open area,
plush pastures.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
He sees a river, which he
assumed to be the Nile,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and he sees almost a movie
occurring showing people

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:90%
building these pyramids.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And he's in there, he
thinks, for maybe an hour,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:84%
but when he comes out, he's
been there for three days.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:84%
He's been for over 72
hours because the crew

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:90%
that he came with were scared.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
They got out of that tunnel
and got out into the open

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:84%
because they thought that they
ended up on some other side.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Or swallowed them up.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Or swallowed them up.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but three days
later, they come back out.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many of
the team went with him?

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Only two.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Only two.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But there were
six other team members.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:90%
It was eight total.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And so those other six
left, but they stayed up

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:84%
in the area outside where
they had an encampment.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
three days later,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
the Colonel and his
assistant come back out.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And he talks of this new
world that they found,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and that he knows now how
these pyramids were built.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:90%
He knows where they are located.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:84%
He knows that there's tunnels
under each one of them.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And he sees these
strange-looking beings,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and this is in his diary,
strange-looking beings that

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:90%
are probably not from Earth.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, he says this in his diary.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:90%
And this is 1928.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So then decide to
make another camp.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
They had to go get supplies
to come back because they only

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
had enough supplies for
a few days or a week,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:84%
But they did and they
brought more people back.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:84%
This time they brought
back some local people.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to explain
through an interpreter

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:84%
to these local people
what they had found.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And these local
people didn't want

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:90%
any part of going down there.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.010 align:middle line:84%
They seemed to be aware of
maybe the rumors or the legends

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:90%
about this particular tunnel.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:90%
But the Colonel didn't.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.835 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't afraid to go back.

00:06:23.835 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So he went back with another
person, a different person,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:84%
not the same that he
went the first time.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.445 align:middle line:90%
So they go down there.

00:06:31.445 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:90%
This time they're prepared.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.570 align:middle line:84%
They have supplies, they
have water, they have things.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Because although they saw
water going through there,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know if they
should drink it or not.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Anyways, they walked through.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:84%
This time, he's closer to where
they're building a pyramid.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:84%
He sees these strange things in
the sky that are flying around

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:90%
with these large bricks.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:90%
He's stumped.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
He can't understand what these
things are that are flying.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Although during
that time period,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:84%
there were airplanes,
conventional airplanes--

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 1928.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Single engine
airplanes in the 1920s.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.130 align:middle line:84%
We had them during
World War I, but they

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.330 align:middle line:84%
didn't look like any of
those type of aircrafts.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And remember, he's
a British Colonel

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and he'd been through war
and he knew airplanes.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
He'd been through World War
I, but he couldn't understand,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't rationalize what
these other things were.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they're
holding these giant blocks.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Right.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's like a movie.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.160 align:middle line:90%
He sees these things happening.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And he watches this
pyramid being built.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.970 align:middle line:84%
But he also sees
this underground area

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:84%
where there's
tunnels and there are

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.090 align:middle line:84%
vast amount of people working
in certain tasks down there.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
baking, some people

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:84%
are doing some kind of work,
like a painting or a carpentry

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.590 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And then some are lying down on
what he refers to as a conveyor

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:07.950 align:middle line:84%
belt. And these bodies are
like moving in to this tunnel.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So he's down there for about
a week, he's estimating.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:84%
When he comes out, now
he has a story to tell.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.178 align:middle line:84%
He documents all
this in his diary.

00:08:17.178 --> 00:08:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If he was a week
down there, when he got back,

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.890 align:middle line:90%
was he gone for four weeks?

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:90%
Did he say?

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, he came back
and it was a week missing.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.005 align:middle line:90%
Missing time for a week.

00:08:27.005 --> 00:08:27.805 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:08:27.805 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And then he goes back.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
He goes-- eventually
gets back to the UK

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and he tells his
story to a society.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.512 align:middle line:90%
And none of them believe him.

00:08:36.512 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:90%
They didn't believe it.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:84%
They didn't believe a word
he said, even though he

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:84%
had a witness, two
witnesses because he brought

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.460 align:middle line:84%
two different people-- took
two different people in there.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.608 align:middle line:84%
So they said, no, we
don't believe you.

00:08:47.608 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's terrible.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It is impossible.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:90%
What you say is not feasible.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:90%
But he keeps this.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Now jump ahead to 1940.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.770 align:middle line:84%
He tells his story to an
American army officer.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And now this
American army officer

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
is very interested
in going there.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:90%
He said, well, take me there.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:90%
I'll fund it.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.430 align:middle line:84%
We'll get money, we'll go
down there, and we'll do it.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
He goes back there, but
it's difficult to find

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.132 align:middle line:90%
this same place again because--

00:09:17.132 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 20 some years later.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, because
remember, sandstorms

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
cover up entrances,
especially lower entrances.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So it takes them a long time
to find this other entrance.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
They finally find the
entrance and they go down,

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:90%
and it's there.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of sand
all around this area.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And he continues to call,
although it's probably

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:84%
not a sarcophagus,
he calls it that.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Although, there
is an exit to it.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:90%
In his diary.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And so he tells the
other-- the American army

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:84%
officer who was a colonel, do
you want to go through that?

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:90%
And they walk through it.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
This time, things
are a lot different.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.848 align:middle line:84%
He sees things differently
than he did 12 years before.

00:10:01.848 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, right, 12 years.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And these
pyramids are built,

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.840 align:middle line:84%
but he still sees these
strange things flying around.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't figure
out what they were

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and nor could the
American Colonel.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're UFOs or
we would say now today,

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:90%
they're UAPs or UFOs flying.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And that, obviously they're
assisting in the building

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:90%
of these pyramids.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.670 align:middle line:84%
That would be the summation
I would end up with.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.430 align:middle line:84%
They stay down there
for a long time in this.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:90%
And they travel.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:84%
The British Colonel didn't
really move around much,

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:84%
but this Army Colonel says,
let's just move around.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's just hike
through these valleys

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.273 align:middle line:90%
and go next to the water.

00:10:47.273 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they all
of a sudden they

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.765 align:middle line:84%
start encountering
people, humans.

00:10:52.765 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they
could see them.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And they could see them.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They could
see each other, I mean.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They could
see each other.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:90%
And they were scared.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.840 align:middle line:84%
The people in this
stargate were scared

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:84%
to death of the intruders
that came in the stargate.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
They would see him and
they would run away.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.630 align:middle line:90%
They would avoid him.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they finally
actually capture

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.980 align:middle line:84%
one guy, a boy, a young boy, and
they trying to talk to the boy.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, neither one of them could
speak Egyptian or the old text,

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:84%
so they couldn't communicate,
but they set him at ease

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.860 align:middle line:84%
making him realize that they
weren't going to harm him.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to bring him
back through the stargate

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and he was hesitant, but
eventually he was brought back

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:90%
through the stargate.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And as he came out of the
stargate, he instantly aged,

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:90%
which horrified these two men.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And they start now thinking
that what they are going to,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and he referred this into in
his diary, as a devil's ring.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a devil's ring
because this person came out

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.340 align:middle line:90%
and he's aging.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't die,
but he just ages.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
In there, he's a
14-year-old boy.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Outside, he's an
80-year-old man.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't really
know what to do other

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:90%
than let him go back inside.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
But he walked back
in without them

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.270 align:middle line:84%
going into seeing
whether he had changed.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to
stay down there longer

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:84%
but, of course, the war
occurred and the Germans

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.650 align:middle line:90%
moved into Egypt at that time.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And actually, some of the first
episode of "Indiana Jones"

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:84%
about what the Germans
did is factual.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.230 align:middle line:84%
That stuff is
factual in history.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:90%
So they had to leave.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't come back.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Blumenthal had died, but
the Army Colonel didn't.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But the Army Colonel later
worked at the war department

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:84%
before the Pentagon and then
eventually the Pentagon.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And he told his story
to many people in there.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people
started rationalizing

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:84%
what these things flying
were something that

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:90%
might have crashed in Roswell.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Now they're putting these two
together because now this is

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:90%
the 1950s.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So he suggested, this
army who is now--

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:84%
the Army General is now
a Brigadier General.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was an Army Colonel.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.823 align:middle line:90%
Now he's a Brigadier General.

00:13:34.823 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who's going
to call him a liar?

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, he's going to
say, let's take an expedition

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:90%
back there.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And this one, the modern day
expedition went back to the Nile

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Valley, they call it.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Operation Nile Dawn.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And they started exploring what
was in the diary of the British

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Colonel Blumenthal.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:90%
And what they found?

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.080 align:middle line:90%
They found artifacts.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, back in those days,
there wasn't tourists.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
organization of the history

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:84%
or the historical
value of the pyramids,

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:90%
both in Sudan and in Egypt.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.710 align:middle line:84%
There were some explorations
by the Egyptians.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
The Cairo University did some
things, but not to the extent

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing today
or what is occurring today

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:90%
in this century.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was
they went back there

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:90%
and they started exploring.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other artifacts
did the military find there?

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Really, what was the
agenda to go out there?

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:90%
To see the stargate again?

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Primary mission
was to find the stargate

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
or find this devil's ring,
as it was noted in the diary.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.482 align:middle line:84%
So they tried in
vain to find it,

00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and there wasn't
anybody they could

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.870 align:middle line:84%
find that had went back
there with the Colonel,

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
other than this Colonel
who is now a general.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't have coordinates
or anything like that.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:84%
They tried a number of
different areas, which

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:84%
is around the Sudan, but they
couldn't find the right place.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So they went to some other
pyramids along the way.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they found
another entrance thinking that

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.855 align:middle line:84%
was the same entrance
that they found in 1940.

00:15:18.855 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:84%
But as they went
down there, they

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:90%
realized it wasn't the same.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.130 align:middle line:84%
But they found all
these artifacts deep

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.800 align:middle line:84%
under this one particular
pyramid, at that

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:90%
time didn't have a name.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And these artifacts
that they located,

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
that they could
pick up and look at,

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.970 align:middle line:84%
didn't appear to be
anything Egyptian.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Some of these artifacts
were figurines

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:46.300 align:middle line:84%
of these beings that had huge
heads with helmets, arms, one

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:84%
with a weapon, and
these were figurines.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't figure out--

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:84%
they knew that during the
Egyptian rules of thousands

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:84%
of years ago, they
didn't have rifles,

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have
weapons like that.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So where could these
things have come from?

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course, knowing
that there was something

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.840 align:middle line:84%
that crashed in Roswell
and we knew something

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.000 align:middle line:84%
about possible
extraterrestrials,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and the General had
been briefed on that,

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
he then figured
that they were gifts

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:84%
given to the Egyptians
by the extraterrestrials.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they took out of
there, took back to be analyzed.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
The artifacts came directly
from an extraterrestrial race

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
as a gift to the
Egyptians, maybe

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle line:84%
for helping them build
pyramids or whatever reason.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't figure it out.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Other than those gifts,
did you see any technology?

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Did you bring back
any technology?

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Was there any technology
they found that was

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.820 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial,
maybe that they studied

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:90%
and were able to activate?

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Later on, and this
was another expedition

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.357 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s, I believe
it was the middle '60s.

00:16:57.357 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:84%
This was when the
Central Intelligence

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Agency became involved.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:84%
The CIA sent their
own people down there,

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.400 align:middle line:84%
their own archaeologists, their
own Egyptian archaeologists,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:84%
and they went into some
other underground caverns,

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:84%
deep, deep to find
this tunnel system that

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:90%
were miles and miles long.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:23.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they weren't prepared
for anything like that.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But what they found was one
item that was somewhat square

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and it had figures on it
that they couldn't figure out

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:90%
what these figures were.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was small and it had
something like an antenna on it,

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:84%
almost something like an old
brick phone, a cell phone.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.395 align:middle line:90%
And they took it back.

00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Finally, eventually got
it back to the United

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:84%
states, sent it to a couple
different laboratories,

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and one particular
laboratory got it to turn on.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh my goodness.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And so there
was a power source.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Now what it was used for, maybe
a communications device or maybe

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:84%
something else, maybe
some kind of a scanner,

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:84%
these are some ideas, but it was
powered, still being powered.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, if this thing
was 2,000 or 3,000,

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even 4,000 years old,
how could anything maintain

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.180 align:middle line:90%
power for that period of time?

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, something that
we wanted to know

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to try
to reverse engineer.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Harvesting that energy.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So that thing is sitting
on some shelf, probably

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
at Los Alamos or
Sandia right now.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They found
these tunnels,

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking pretty large
tunnels, I believe, right?

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, there
were tunnels big enough

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
to drive motorized
vehicles in them.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And
eventually, could you

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
tell us where did
these tunnels lead to?

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: These tunnels led
under every single current day

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.538 align:middle line:90%
pyramid.

00:18:46.538 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I think if you look in
Egyptian literature,

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:84%
there's 118 pyramids, but these
tunnels led to at least 60

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.620 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them
had these tunnels.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And these tunnels led
under these pyramids.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And then there was exits
that you could then

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:84%
venture outside into the pyramid
that was above that tunnel.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And there were a number of
caverns under there where

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:90%
they found things stored, food.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:84%
One particular area
under one pyramid,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
they had rice, tons and
tons of rice and honey.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.530 align:middle line:90%
Containers of honey.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:29.247 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Still viable.

00:19:29.247 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: And still viable.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:10%
I don't know about the rice,
but they took the honey back

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:10%
and found it, after 1,000 years,
the honey is still viable.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:90%
And that really shocked me.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yes, I was reading
a report in Los Alamos,

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:90%
they were testing that honey.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.137 align:middle line:84%
Even to this day,
they keep testing it

00:19:48.137 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
for some reason for
something, I don't

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.260 align:middle line:84%
know, for maybe some healing
properties or magical properties

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:90%
of some sort.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
tunnel that went under Giza.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There was a
tunnel under Giza.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:84%
That was the most
advanced tunnel system,

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:84%
not just because of
the different caverns

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:84%
within that tunnel
system, but the structure

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and the construction
of this tunnel system.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:19.567 align:middle line:84%
It was far more advanced
than any others.

00:20:19.567 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were they like
lava tubes, Richard,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.810 align:middle line:84%
or did he explain it was
like rock on these tunnels?

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:26.887 align:middle line:90%
What was the makeup?

00:20:26.887 --> 00:20:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: There they were created.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.095 align:middle line:90%
They were structured.

00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
There were brick
tunnels that you could

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:90%
see that they were constructed.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But one of the questions
that was asked,

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know that
they answered it,

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:45.370 align:middle line:84%
was how could some Egyptian
civilization 4,000 years ago

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:50.410 align:middle line:84%
construct this complicated
tunnel system with bricks

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:90%
in the exact same place?

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:59.390 align:middle line:84%
The diameters are perfect for
movement of big things inside.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have vehicles
back then, but they had sleds.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And maybe if the
extraterrestrials

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:84%
created these tunnels,
the extraterrestrials

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of craft, maybe
a motor craft or some craft--

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:84%
battery-powered craft that
could move within these tunnels

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.170 align:middle line:84%
because there were
hundreds of miles long.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're so complex,
but this one under Giza

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:90%
was extremely complex.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And it had hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of chambers.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is below.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids up here, all those
other chambers are up here.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:84%
This is under the pyramids,
hundreds of feet down.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:84%
700, 800 feet down,
I think, they're

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
estimating the
depth of these are.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:84%
In the '60s, the CIA
archaeologists took pictures

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and so forth and probably movie
pictures and presented them

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:84%
to construction
engineers, asking them,

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.270 align:middle line:84%
how would you make
something like that?

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we
would have to dig that out,

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
which would take years, and we'd
have to bring all that stuff in,

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.722 align:middle line:90%
it would take more years.

00:22:05.722 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:84%
He said we could
probably build something

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:90%
like that in 15 or 20 years.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The question
is, what came first,

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:90%
the tunnels or the pyramid?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That's the
question that I asked.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:84%
When I heard this information
and talking to the person that

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:84%
had access to it, that's
the first thing I said, was,

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.290 align:middle line:84%
did they build the
tunnels first or did

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:90%
they build the pyramids first?

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.200 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No one knows.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But the
extraterrestrials

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:84%
or the Egyptians who are
probably long dead now,

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they
find any spacecraft

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrial craft?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yes, they
did find one in Giza.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:84%
It was not a very
big one, but they

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.332 align:middle line:84%
found one that had
certainly got in there

00:22:48.332 --> 00:22:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't figure out
how it got in there because it

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.220 align:middle line:84%
was in this cavern
that's hundreds of feet

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:84%
under this pyramid and
there's no really exit points

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:90%
except for these tunnels.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And these tunnels
weren't wide enough

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:05.890 align:middle line:84%
or big enough for this craft to
be buried there or end up there.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So they don't know how
they got it in there.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
is trying to get it out.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.740 align:middle line:84%
They tried to disassemble
it, but we didn't

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.548 align:middle line:90%
have any tools to do that.

00:23:15.548 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What did it look like?

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It was probably a
10-foot diameter spacecraft.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was more oval
shaped than round shape.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.970 align:middle line:84%
They were able to get in
it because the bottom part

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.920 align:middle line:90%
of the hatch was open.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.790 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anything
on the bottom of it.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, it probably
ended up there, maybe crashed

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:84%
or was disabled and they didn't
want to get it out of there

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:39.860 align:middle line:90%
or repair it.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.690 align:middle line:90%
But you could go inside that.

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And there was people that, CIA
scientists that got inside there

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and looked at it
and took pictures.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.800 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know what
they found because that

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.780 align:middle line:84%
would have been something
entirely different

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.100 align:middle line:90%
in classification.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And where
is that craft now?

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Still there.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what conclusion
did the US government make

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:00.912 align:middle line:90%
in regards to the pyramids?

00:24:00.912 --> 00:24:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, that
was highly classified,

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
but they came to the conclusion
that the pyramids were

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:84%
built or assisted being built
by the extraterrestrials.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:90%
They weren't built by Egyptians.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
There's no way in the world
they could manufacture pyramids

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
or an underground tunnel
system that was found.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't
have the technology

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:84%
or the know-how of
their engineering

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.340 align:middle line:90%
to build something like that.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So they figured that the
extraterrestrials came down,

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
whatever race it was, and
built the tunnel system first

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.810 align:middle line:84%
for them, and then
eventually assisted them.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was some
assistance with the Egyptians,

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
but they built these pyramids
for a particular reason.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And one particular pyramid had
some type of a sundial on top

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
of it when they first
found it in the '40s.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.182 align:middle line:84%
I think they removed it or
somehow that was removed.

00:24:57.182 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And so another thing they found,
some of the pyramids in Mexico

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:84%
align directly with
these pyramids in Egypt.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
come to the conclusion

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramids in Egypt
and the pyramids in Mexico

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:84%
were built by the
same civilization.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Once again, Richard,
it's a very fascinating story.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad you got
to review that diary.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Thank you Emery.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:90%
It was a pleasure.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
