00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: Welcome
back to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David
Wilcock, and we're here

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:10%
with our special
guest, Emery Smith,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:10%
continuing our fascinating
discussion about the co-workers

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.360 align:middle line:10%
that he actually interacted
with as live beings

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:10%
while in the
underground facilities.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.526 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks, Dave.

00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Excited to be here.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was the very first
extraterrestrial that you saw

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:90%
on these bases--

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:84%
the first time you actually
saw a living being that

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:90%
was not human like us?

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's the Tall Whites.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, OK.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So could you
tell us a little bit more

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:90%
about that first meeting?

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously I would
think the very first time

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.290 align:middle line:84%
you actually see a living being
that's clearly not one of us,

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:84%
it has to be just
an absolute landmark

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.472 align:middle line:90%
moment in your entire life.

00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:10.930 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well
actually, indirectly,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.509 align:middle line:10%
by seeing these from
afar, and seeing these

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:10%
through different windows
and different programs,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:10%
and then reading about them, I
had a really good understanding

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:10%
of what was going on
way before I was even

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:10%
getting able to see these,
by researching programs

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:10%
that I was allowed to.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So they're breaking
you in first just

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
by watching videos, and reading
books, and reading things

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:84%
on their database
system that have

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.790 align:middle line:84%
to do with the past of
working with these beings

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:90%
and these creatures.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let's open up
this Tall White discussion,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:84%
because there has been
some confusion in terms

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:84%
of, for example,
certain discrepancies

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
between the whistleblower
named Charles Hall,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and what he called
Tall Whites, whose

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
eyes seemed to be more like
Greys, but had a bluish tinge.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:84%
We have Pete Peterson who's
described his experience

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
with Tall Whites, and he
said that it doesn't really

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:90%
mean any one type.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.120 align:middle line:84%
It just is a classification
based on their appearance.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And Corey has his experiences
with the Anshar, which

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:84%
appear to be very much more
human-like, but as they age,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:90%
they will get taller eventually.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So what would you
call tall whites?

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Just give us a description
of what they look like,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and any other specific
physical identifying details

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:90%
to start with.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.440 align:middle line:90%
They're over seven feet tall.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:84%
They have a small face, a
little bit smaller than ours.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
They're very
slender in the arms.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Very ectomorphic
as we would say.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.910 align:middle line:84%
They have a very fluid movement
that's actually like a dance.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
this-- when they move,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.030 align:middle line:84%
they're articulating
their joints,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and their limbs are
flexible, not like ours,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:90%
which are really rigid.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:84%
They also have a very
deep understanding

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
of all of our belief systems,
and they're very compassionate,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:90%
and they're very smart.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen them
from afar probably

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:84%
six to seven months
before I actually--

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
was actually next to a few
of them during a project.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if I
gather correctly, then,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:84%
the face would be predominantly
like ours, but just smaller.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's slender.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I hate to bring up movies,
but in the Star Wars movies,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.310 align:middle line:84%
there was a group
of tall white beings

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.720 align:middle line:84%
that we're making clones of
one of the soldiers there,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and they were in
charge of this planet,

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and they had this really
slender, beautiful, oval face

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.140 align:middle line:84%
with these really beautiful eyes
that took most of the face up.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So the eyes were at least two
times to three times larger

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:84%
than our own eyes, and their
nose was almost non-existent--

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:84%
very small, very petite,
kind of like an Asian nose,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
with just very small
nostrils, and beautiful lips,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:90%
and a nice small mouth.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the eyes are a
very prominent feature, then--

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --but they would be
almost like one of these Anime

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
characters in the sense
that it still looks human,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:90%
but they're just a lot larger.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
The eyes are oval, and they're
offset about 20 degrees.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:90%
So they are like this.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.519 align:middle line:84%
Ours are this way, but
there's is offset just a hair,

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:84%
so it's coming this
way, through the ovals.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So more of a Russian
or Scandinavian look, then?

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.125 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And when I
refer to the Tall Whites,

00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I am not referring to the
blond blue-eyed tall people

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.900 align:middle line:84%
from Scandinavia that you hear
a lot in pop culture of those.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:90%
These are--

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Like the
so-called Nordics.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct, the Nordics.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their skin
is just ash white.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
It is so white that
they actually--

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
light comes off of them
and reflects off of them.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a really
beautiful type of skin,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:90%
kind of like a sheen to it.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But very white, and very long
fingers, and regular feet

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:90%
like we have.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Are they bald?

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: There there's no hair.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
hair on any of them.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They do wear clothes
and uniforms like we do,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:84%
usually skin-tight
types of clothing.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:84%
They have a very intricate
internal organ system

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that is capable of
living on almost

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:90%
any planet or any atmosphere.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
So they can breathe a
lot of different types

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:84%
of gaseous chemicals,
and different gases that

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:90%
would normally kill one of us.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.936 align:middle line:84%
And they have a very
small chest, in a V shape.

00:05:50.936 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So it definitely
doesn't look like a Grey.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It would be like
a bald person like us,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:84%
with white skin, but
a more skinny-looking

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.850 align:middle line:90%
face who's just really tall.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of the
things that Pete

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.990 align:middle line:84%
described about these beings
was that they would have a wand.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.224 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever notice
them carrying a wand--

00:06:08.224 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, I never--

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.575 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --or any type of tools?

00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I never seen
them have a wand,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:84%
but they did wear these
special bracelets,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and these special
collar-type things.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if it has something

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
to do with their
internal organ system.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't really
debriefed that much.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:90%
That's all they told me.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Did you have any idea as to
what those bracelets or collars

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.400 align:middle line:90%
might function for?

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well they
had lights on them,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and these lights were like a
blue ribbon around the center

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:90%
of the collar.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So the collar was
about an inch thick--

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean an inch wide--

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.550 align:middle line:84%
very thin, and in the
middle of that collar,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:84%
maybe a quarter of an inch, was
a stripe that went around it.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And this light rotated
around this blue centerpiece,

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and it was always on, and
it was always coincided

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:90%
with the bracelets they had on.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: They rotated in phase?

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The light--
yeah, they both rotated

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:90%
in the exact same phase.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So did you ever
have an intuitive sense,

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.945 align:middle line:84%
or did you try to guess as
to what that might be for?

00:07:13.945 --> 00:07:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think
it has something

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.490 align:middle line:84%
to do with maybe, when they
travel to different places,

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:84%
this helps with getting certain
nutrients, and chemicals,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and minerals, and vitamins
into their body somehow.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I think it's somehow keeping
their voltage up, and keeping

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:90%
them energized.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The version
of Tall Whites

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:84%
that Pete was
talking about, which

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.650 align:middle line:84%
may not be the same, he
said that they really

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:84%
have trouble getting too
close to humans like us,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:84%
that it's almost a
psychic mess for them.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Did you observe them in some
degree wanting to keep distance

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:90%
from regular earth humans?

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Not these Tall
Whites, but yes, there

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:84%
have been other
Hybrid Whites that

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
are over-sensitized by
our fields of energy

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:84%
because they're picking up on
every cellular energy we have.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we're all in one
sync to this other white race

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.030 align:middle line:84%
of ETs, and I think it
has to do with we carry

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
a lot of bacteria-- good
bacteria, and bad bacteria,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and viruses on us,
and they all give off

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.240 align:middle line:84%
this special pulse of energy,
and it's overwhelming for them,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and they can actually get
sick by being around a human

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:90%
too much.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's what
he's referring to.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Describe
for me the first time

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:84%
that you encountered
a Tall White,

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:84%
because this is where
we're saying now,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
you saw him through
the window, you

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
might had some briefings or
something, the first time

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
that you actually
are face to face

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:90%
with a non-terrestrial entity.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They were brought
in on a number of occasions,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:84%
working on humans that
have deceased for unknown--

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.434 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why--
unknown reasons.

00:09:02.434 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Earth humans?

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.266 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Earth humans.

00:09:04.266 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But they obviously were
very concerned about this,

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and they would be brought
in, and worked with the team.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had two of
them at one time

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.690 align:middle line:84%
in the same room that
I was working on taking

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.239 align:middle line:90%
some samples from somebody.

00:09:19.239 --> 00:09:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Was it easy to tell
the difference between men

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:90%
and women?

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:90%
There was a feminine--

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:84%
more slender facial features,
and the eyes were a little

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
bit not as large, and the
eyebrows also-- not eyebrows,

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.620 align:middle line:84%
but you can see
there was a tinge

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.230 align:middle line:90%
of an eyebrow, but not hair.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:84%
It was just like the pigment
was different above the eyes,

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.290 align:middle line:84%
a little bit off
white, I'll say.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And you could tell by those two
reasons, just facial features.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:84%
The bodies looked
pretty much identical.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never seen
them walk around.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.844 align:middle line:84%
They always had some sort
of clothing on or something.

00:09:59.844 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And what did
that clothing look like?

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: The same.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.550 align:middle line:84%
It was always some sort
of skin tight apparel,

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.280 align:middle line:90%
like a Spandex of some sort.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:84%
They always did have
gloves on all the time.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:84%
So this clothing material
was covering pretty much

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.530 align:middle line:84%
their whole body except
their neck and face.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'm curious
about what was

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.355 align:middle line:90%
their form of communication.

00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Did they speak
with their mouths?

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're
very telepathic.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:84%
They can speak perfect
English, and other languages--

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.420 align:middle line:90%
all the languages actually.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to because
they will just look at you.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And they say, when you have
the look, please look back,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
because it's this eye
thing that they do.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:84%
When you see their
eyes and your eyes,

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:84%
it's like a link
of some sort, where

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
it's like the-- however
it works, it's downloaded,

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
everything that they're
thinking, to you,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
receptive to you

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.800 align:middle line:84%
as well, like they
know everything

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.170 align:middle line:90%
about you once you meet them.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if you were to
have an unloving or judgmental

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.537 align:middle line:84%
thought about the
way they look--

00:11:04.537 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure
this happen sometime.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Definitely happens.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What would occur?

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's just walk through
a situation where--

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They don't--
they don't react to that,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:84%
because they know that
sometimes it takes a little time

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:84%
for people to get used to them
because they're different,

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and the same thing, I think,
would happen to us if we were

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.060 align:middle line:90%
thrown into their world.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.170 align:middle line:84%
We would have to
be really egoless,

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and have to accept that
maybe I won't be liked

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.300 align:middle line:84%
because of the way I looked,
or because I know everything

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.955 align:middle line:84%
that you're thinking
right now, which is OK.

00:11:36.955 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:90%
It's so what, and then what?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So I really do
want to get a little more

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:84%
specific on the exact moment
that you first made eye contact

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.080 align:middle line:90%
with a non-terrestrial being.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:84%
What was it like
that first moment

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:90%
you looked into its eyes?

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We were getting
dressed with our suits

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:90%
to go into an operating room.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And their suits are a lot
different than our suits,

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.030 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Theirs are for their bodies.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And I just noticed
as the technicians

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.620 align:middle line:84%
was helping them get dressed
and Ziploc their suits up,

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:16.650 align:middle line:84%
the fluid motion they had,
of going into the suit.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
It was very fluid, and being
at the operating table,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and I was helping them
with some instruments.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And they moved so
fluidly, and so--

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.100 align:middle line:90%
but it's really fast.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
They move fast, but
it's just this dance.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want you think
it's like super slow,

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:84%
but it was the fluidness of,
you know, their bodies are--

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
like I said, their
bones are very flexible,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:90%
unlike our bones.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
But they do have the five
fingers, and the hands.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
They're just longer fingers,
and the palms are more square,

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.410 align:middle line:90%
not round like ours.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And those are some of
the features that I knew.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking at them,
not even saying anything,

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:90%
and it was like a greeting.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:84%
It was as we're
getting ready to go in,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and we looked at each other,
and just the word, greeting,

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:90%
came to me.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.090 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a voice, it was
just the word, greetings.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, in my
mind, looking at them

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and saying the same thing in my
mind, and they cracked a smile.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, I could see-- they
have the same facial features.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Their eyes move up and down.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:84%
They can move their
nose, and they

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:90%
have muscles in their face.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could they throw things
in your mind, like colors,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.777 align:middle line:84%
symbols, visual
images of places?

00:13:32.777 --> 00:13:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Give you a
holographic type of--

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
They even have a way, if they
want to teach you something

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know, to
basically download that

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:90%
into your brain--

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
into your consciousness
--in a matter of seconds.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So you could learn
something pretty quick

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing on
the table from being just

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:90%
across the table from them.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:02.239 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When you were working
with them in these autopsies,

00:14:02.239 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:84%
you had mentioned
that sometimes they

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.120 align:middle line:84%
were concerned about
humans from here who

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:90%
had died in strange ways.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
What were some of the
other circumstances

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.130 align:middle line:90%
that they were called in?

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Really tough cases
where there might have not--

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.762 align:middle line:84%
that they would not know why
this ET or this human died.

00:14:19.762 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: "They" meaning
the people on the base.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The people on the
base would give them, probably,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.734 align:middle line:90%
the most difficult cases.

00:14:26.734 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: To the Tall Whites.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, to
the Tall Whites.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
would not allow us

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.800 align:middle line:84%
in the rooms with those
types of patients,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.902 align:middle line:90%
but we were part of a team.

00:14:36.902 --> 00:14:39.360 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand, even
though you're not in the room,

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:84%
you still can be working
on the outside of the room

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:84%
looking in, and helping
get supplies and things.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Can you recall
a specific example

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.660 align:middle line:84%
of an autopsy that was not of a
person from Earth that involved

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:84%
a Tall White, and just tell
us what type of being it was,

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:90%
and why was it so hard to solve.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well this falls under
the chemical thing again.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:90%
We do get beings that come in--

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:84%
other Hybrid Whites
that look shorter.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.950 align:middle line:84%
They're about our
height, our size,

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.080 align:middle line:84%
but they're very,
very white, and they

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:90%
have crystal clear blue eyes.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:84%
They always have white
or blond hair, so--

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:90%
and they have ears, unlike--

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
the Tall Whites don't
really have ears,

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.830 align:middle line:84%
but the human Hybrid
Whites, I call them,

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
actually do have ears, and
they look kind of like us,

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and their teeth
are very different.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Their teeth are round.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So they're, like, half-mooned,
not square like ours,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.850 align:middle line:90%
and it is weird.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't really see
their teeth too much.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And we were working
on this one that

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:90%
was brought in that had these--

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:50.400 align:middle line:84%
looks like burned
injection spots that

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.410 align:middle line:84%
ran up and down their
chest, and there

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:90%
was about six little holes--

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.360 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, all the
way down to the belly button.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like it was some
sort of weapon that burned it

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:84%
into their skin, but in the
middle of these circular burns

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.620 align:middle line:84%
were three dots that
looked like a triangle,

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:84%
if you could attach lines
to them, a perfect triangle.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to
figure out what type of weapon

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
killed this Hybrid White, and
why, and where did it happen.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:84%
They can actually
attach themselves

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:84%
to the brain of a dead being,
and download its information

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:84%
to their head, and
they can find out

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:84%
how did this happen, where did
it happen, who's responsible,

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and figure out a whole
story within minutes.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:90%
So what was the conclusion?

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Were you aware of the
conclusion of how it died?

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.803 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, I was
not aware, but they

00:16:46.803 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:84%
did know what happened, and they
did look very sad about this.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.690 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
anguish on their face.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When you saw a
movie like "Men In Black,"

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
what was your
feeling about that,

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.370 align:middle line:84%
where you have Will
Smith, and there

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.889 align:middle line:84%
are agents working in these
underground facilities with all

00:17:05.889 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:90%
these extraterrestrials around?

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:84%
What was your feeling
when you saw that film?

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm really
not a big fan of that.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't like when
Hollywood makes

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
fun of extraterrestrials
as some sort of game,

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.680 align:middle line:90%
or some sort of horrible threat.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And I did not resonate
with that movie at all.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
movies out there,

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and animation, where
extraterrestrials are portrayed

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.310 align:middle line:84%
very well, such as the one
that you and I saw recently,

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:40.220 align:middle line:90%
called--

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.977 align:middle line:90%
was it "Valerian?"

00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah, "Valerian."

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, and these
ET's looked exactly

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:90%
like these Tall Whites.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, wasn't
there a part in there

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle line:84%
where the United Nations of
ETs were coming together,

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and there was all
different kinds?

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's right.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.838 align:middle line:90%
Right at the beginning.

00:17:57.838 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, that was
a very accurate depiction

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.520 align:middle line:84%
of the many different
kinds of extraterrestrials

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.246 align:middle line:84%
that are out there that have
to bring their own environment.

00:18:06.246 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:84%
One was like a
fish or something.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:90%
It had an aquarium on his head.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And of course that's kind of
funny, but it actually is true.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:84%
We talk about ET's
wearing things

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:84%
that are from
either their planet,

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:84%
to keep the energy
correct, and also they

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.810 align:middle line:84%
might have to have a special
helmet just for their head

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:90%
to sustain their life.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:29.770 align:middle line:90%
So that was a really good--

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I was impressed with the
screenwriters, and the writers,

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:90%
and the animators that did that.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now Corey Goode, when
he had his first experience

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
on the moon in modern
times, so he says,

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.140 align:middle line:84%
encountered an avian
type of humanoid

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.500 align:middle line:84%
that apparently nobody in the
space program had seen before.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is the blue avian--

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.615 align:middle line:90%
we talked about this.

00:18:49.615 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:90%
I know you've seen the image.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.289 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I've seen this image.

00:18:52.289 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So did you
ever see any type

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.580 align:middle line:84%
of Avian humanoids yourself,
such as these Blue Avians,

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:84%
or other types
that were similar?

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, similar to that,
but not specifically like that.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
They were very human-like, and
they had very small feathers

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and large skin pores, but
they, for the most part,

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
looked more human
than they did a bird.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:84%
But they did have these
attributes of certain things.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have a nose.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
They did have, like,
a small beak there,

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
but the beak actually
had teeth in it.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have the
kind of head you would see--

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't like an
exact bird head,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and the eyes were flat
across, just like ours,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.750 align:middle line:84%
but they could see perfectly
straight this way, instead of--

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
a bird probably has
more on the outside.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So very more-- like I said,
more human than anything,

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.690 align:middle line:84%
but had very small
wing feather--

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.870 align:middle line:84%
little skin flaps under
their arms, and lots

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.450 align:middle line:84%
of feathers on the
back, but not so much

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:84%
on the face and
the chest at all.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did any of them have
tropical colors like a toucan,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.981 align:middle line:90%
or how did they look?

00:19:58.981 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, they did.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:84%
There were turquoise ones with
a beautiful purple, white, and

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
turquoise fading, in and
out, up and down the body.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So it might start with
a blue head and neck,

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and then fade to white, and
then maybe a light purple down

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.950 align:middle line:90%
towards the feet.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:18.992 align:middle line:84%
But they had feet like we
have feet, but it was--

00:20:18.992 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: They didn't
look like bird feet.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, not at all.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, the only
thing that gave it away was

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.990 align:middle line:84%
the facial features
and the feathers,

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:90%
and that very scaly-type skin--

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.659 align:middle line:90%
a very porous skin.

00:20:33.659 --> 00:20:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well this is kind
of ridiculous, but how would

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:84%
you compare it to
Howard the Duck?

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Not like that.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.988 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Because that's a
beak that really protrudes.

00:20:42.988 --> 00:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's a
big duck bill beak.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:84%
But no, I never seen anything
like a big beak like that,

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:90%
except for the pterodactyl.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Pterodactyl being
sounds kind of disturbing.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It does look
probably scary to most people,

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.480 align:middle line:84%
because it's got these dragon
attributes of these wings

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:84%
with hands, but it has legs just
like we do-- very thin legs,

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.940 align:middle line:90%
kind of like the Ant People.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And they have very
small wings that

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:90%
are attached like a fruit bat.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:90%
The arms are part of the wings.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And they always have
a device with them,

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and this one was carrying
a cylindrical device

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
in its arm, like this,
with its claw around it,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and this one-- this pterodactyl
being had an actual claw.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It had the long, pointy beak
that came all the way back--

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.240 align:middle line:90%
you know the one that has--

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:84%
the actual bone structure
actually goes farther back.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And they communicate
through a series

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:44.020 align:middle line:84%
of loud, high-pitched
tones, not like an owl,

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:84%
not like a bird chirping, but
just high-pitched tonality.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you ever see any
of these pterodactyl beings

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.830 align:middle line:84%
while you were in the
underground bases?

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.930 align:middle line:84%
On the very deep, deep
levels of these bases,

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:84%
we were informed
that they were there,

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and they had to do with
some sort of consciousness,

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and I want to say
religion, but it's not.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a study of some
sort of history long,

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:90%
and I've forgotten.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:90%
And they are sent in to--

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
they're like the people who
put the puzzles together,

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:84%
are these beings, and they can
move things with their mind.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:84%
They have telekinetic energies,
and they can move small things

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.110 align:middle line:84%
around the rooms,
and there might

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.260 align:middle line:84%
be anywhere from one
to four of these beings

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:84%
looking at something,
and moving things around

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.392 align:middle line:84%
in these think tank
rooms, they call them.

00:22:36.392 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why do
you think they were

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:90%
kept at the bottom of the base?

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe that,
because of the way they look,

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.270 align:middle line:84%
because they do look like
a type of flying dragon,

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and I think because
they don't do well

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
with being around a lot
of other extraterrestrials

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.050 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.890 align:middle line:84%
They seem to need a lot of
space when they move around.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's areas-- they just
can't walk through a door,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.330 align:middle line:84%
leastwise they're very
abstract, bulky-looking.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And you know, just turning
their head, they could--

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:90%
these things can be--

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:84%
just their heads alone could be
up to three to four feet long,

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and just by turning their head
they can knock a lot of stuff

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:90%
over.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's a special
place down there for them

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.566 align:middle line:84%
that they are allowed to
do these, which I don't

00:23:27.566 --> 00:23:28.690 align:middle line:90%
know what the programs are.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.398 align:middle line:84%
I just know they're
the thought-thinkers.

00:23:30.398 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:84%
They're the puzzle-solvers,
they call them.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.411 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I want to run
something by you that I've

00:23:34.411 --> 00:23:36.429 align:middle line:90%
heard from some other insiders.

00:23:36.429 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of what I've heard-- and
this is actually from more than

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:90%
one guy has told me this--

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:46.080 align:middle line:84%
certain ET groups apparently
were worried about a reptilian

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:84%
sentient life on Earth becoming
really dominant and aggressive

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.120 align:middle line:90%
to other species.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And the 65 million
year old cataclysm

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.550 align:middle line:84%
that hit the earth apparently
was intended to wipe them out.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that
time that the moon,

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
which apparently is a used car--
and I talked about this William

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Tompkins--

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:84%
was then parked around the Earth
to create a seasonal climate

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:84%
that would allow mammalian
life rather than reptilian life

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:90%
to become dominant.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if you ever heard about
that scenario of the dinosaur

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.320 align:middle line:84%
catastrophe being a
planned event to wipe out

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:90%
sentient reptilians?

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I have
heard of a event that

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:36.260 align:middle line:84%
was intentional to destroy
the Earth because reptilians

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
were not allowed on it anymore,
because of Inner Earth beings,

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
and also dates back to Atlantis,
and Lumeria, and whatnot,

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that there was this
war of some sort,

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:84%
that they were being
utilized and used

00:24:54.260 --> 00:25:00.140 align:middle line:84%
by these reptilians, the Draco,
or whatever you call them.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I read in some
of the history books in there.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know how
accurate that is, because it

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:90%
was written not as a document.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.030 align:middle line:84%
It was like someone
was just telling

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.310 align:middle line:90%
you what happened back then.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And there has been
archaeological finds

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:84%
in the Vatican
from this time that

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:84%
depicts reptilian beings
destroying Aquifarians

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:90%
and other beings of that time.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a
high probable cause

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.920 align:middle line:84%
to put two and two
together to say yeah,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.900 align:middle line:90%
I would agree with that.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'm curious
about whether you ever

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:47.309 align:middle line:84%
saw something that would look
like the Yeti or the Bigfoot

00:25:47.309 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:84%
while you were working
in these facilities,

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.890 align:middle line:84%
because some people have
reported things like that.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I mean, I
have personal experience with

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.160 align:middle line:84%
the Bigfoot, and the
skunk apes, and the Yetis,

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.140 align:middle line:90%
and all the different types of--

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:05.290 align:middle line:84%
I remember in my teen years,
around 16 years of age,

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:84%
there was a large white
Chewbacca-type being,

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:84%
eight or nine feet tall, and I
was camping out in Florida down

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.450 align:middle line:90%
in south, near the Everglades.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably
around 150 yards away.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
It was far, but it
was an open field.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It was at dawn.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And I just saw this being
walking next to the fence line.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was like five feet
higher than the fence

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:84%
posts, which were
four feet tall.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And the stride of this thing
was, like, over six feet.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And I literally
stopped in my tracks

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and watched this thing
walk all the way across.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I go back
and check the dates--

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:84%
now that there is
these things online,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.120 align:middle line:84%
you can look for spottings
of these extraterrestrials--

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed that
in the area I was,

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:59.210 align:middle line:84%
this being has been seen many,
many times by many people,

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and that was a great
confirmation for me.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:84%
It was greater
confirmation for me

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:84%
when I started
working in the labs

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:90%
to actually see these beings.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:12.080 align:middle line:84%
These beings have been
here a very long time.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.420 align:middle line:84%
They work with the
Inner Earth beings.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:84%
They're here to
collect and gather

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:23.330 align:middle line:84%
data and DNA from all the living
species, and plants, and water,

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and animals in the water,
and fish and everything,

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and they're cataloging
this, and putting it

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.020 align:middle line:84%
on a type of vault
somewhere in order

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.200 align:middle line:84%
to preserve what
Earth really is--

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.320 align:middle line:84%
kind of a museum
for Earth somewhere.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you can
never get these guys on film

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.530 align:middle line:84%
too much, because they have
the ability to teletransport

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:46.980 align:middle line:90%
themselves at will.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And they can be very
mysterious, and get out

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:52.820 align:middle line:90%
of somewhere really quick.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well I just
want to say this.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:59.120 align:middle line:84%
It is amazing that we don't
have a widespread understanding

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:84%
of the reality of Bigfoot
given the thousands

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of eyewitness
sightings, the tracings

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:84%
of footprints, the very bizarre
cases of property damage,

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.670 align:middle line:84%
where fingernail marks have
clawed right through vehicles,

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:90%
things like this.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think we have
such a hard time accepting

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.910 align:middle line:84%
these eyewitness
testimony as a Bigfoot?

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you know,
these are very large animals.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't consider them
too much human, I'll say.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But they have a consciousness,
and they have a job to do.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're probably
the lowest-maintenance

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.674 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial that I know.

00:28:36.674 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is they can be

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.880 align:middle line:84%
dropped on a planet
with nothing,

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and gather these items, and
catalog them, and store them

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, and then, like
the movie "Predator," where

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
they come down and hunt people,
and then take all their skulls

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.202 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:28:52.202 --> 00:28:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So imagine this guy just
coming down and snatching up

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.820 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of lavender and daisies.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.862 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:28:56.862 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So they're not
doing anything violent?

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, they're
not allowed to.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.030 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
prohibited from hurting

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.160 align:middle line:90%
any type of living creature.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.626 align:middle line:84%
So they could take your hair,
but they can't take your head.

00:29:11.626 --> 00:29:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what
you're describing here

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
sounds like a fairly
intelligent being.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Do they have
communication skills?

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.824 align:middle line:84%
Could they speak, or do
they have a telepathic--

00:29:21.824 --> 00:29:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, they're the other
ones that use their vocal cords

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.550 align:middle line:84%
to the voice, and
also they can do--

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:84%
like elephants have this ability
to send these large thumps

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.140 align:middle line:84%
through the ground,
and these things

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.510 align:middle line:84%
can be heard for miles, and
miles, and miles, and miles

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:90%
away by another elephant.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So they have that
ability, and that's

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:84%
why people here
really weird shrieks.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.470 align:middle line:84%
They hear really
weird thumping sounds.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:50.390 align:middle line:84%
People usually say it's someone
banging on a tree or something,

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.760 align:middle line:90%
and not so much that.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And they can communicate that
way too if they, let's say,

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.030 align:middle line:84%
have a sore belly and they
can't use their diaphragm

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.680 align:middle line:90%
to make these noises.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There do seem to be
different types of Bigfoot.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And so since we're
out of time now,

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I just want to
round this out with,

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:12.350 align:middle line:84%
do you think that there might
be some that are not necessarily

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:84%
on this mission, and are less
intelligent, and more primal

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.090 align:middle line:90%
and dangerous?

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've read some
documents in my classified,

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:28.910 align:middle line:84%
compartmentalized projects
that stated that they have--

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:84%
if they get sick or
something happens to them,

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:36.110 align:middle line:84%
they cannot use their
teletransportation abilities,

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and they get lost or left
behind on many planets,

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and they have to stay
there indefinitely.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And these are some of the lost
ones that are hiding in the--

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.890 align:middle line:84%
but they're very adaptable,
and they like to work alone.

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:52.550 align:middle line:84%
They're very solitude-type
extraterrestrials

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:55.999 align:middle line:84%
that I heard only mate
maybe once a lifetime.

00:30:55.999 --> 00:30:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If they were
going to teletransport back

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.232 align:middle line:84%
to where they came from,
where would that be?

00:31:00.232 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything
about their origins?

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.231 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, I don't know
anything about their origins,

00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:09.080 align:middle line:84%
but I know they know-- they have
an indistinctive way to trace

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.360 align:middle line:90%
portals on the Earth--

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.210 align:middle line:84%
natural portals on the
Earth, not man-made portals,

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:84%
that they know where to
go, and they might travel

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:90%
vast distances to do that.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.670 align:middle line:84%
But they will never
go through a city,

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:84%
or they're not allowed to
interact with the beings

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.160 align:middle line:90%
from any planet.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Last
question, real quick,

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.259 align:middle line:84%
did you see them in
the underground bases?

00:31:33.259 --> 00:31:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Was there some loophole
where they could actually

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.984 align:middle line:84%
work with us in these
classified facilities?

00:31:37.984 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've only
seen dead ones.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, really?

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.677 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't actually work
in these underground bases

00:31:43.677 --> 00:31:44.510 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of us.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They said-- there's
some rumors that they have.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen things from
far away that look like them.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And there is catalogs of
them being on the base,

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:84%
but I'd have not worked
physically with one.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.564 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK, cool.

00:32:01.564 --> 00:32:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, Emery, this is
really fascinating.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
coming out and giving us

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.680 align:middle line:90%
all this amazing information.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Thanks.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And I want to
thank you for watching.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.690 align:middle line:84%
