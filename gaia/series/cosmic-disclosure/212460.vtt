>> EMERY SMITH: Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we are with Tim,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.490 align:middle line:10%
who is speaking with
us from Germany.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in the
covert governance in Germany,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.680 align:middle line:10%
that is related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.215 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Thank you so
much for having me again.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Many of us have
heard about an ancient war

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.165 align:middle line:84%
in the Orion system, what can
you tell us about it and who

00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:38.965 align:middle line:90%
was involved?

00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yeah, so working on
those projects with Greys,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.800 align:middle line:84%
we actually heard a lot about
those conflicts that were

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle line:84%
coming from Orion actually,
and we know that there's a very

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
long, millions of years old
ancient war over Orion that

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.575 align:middle line:84%
just recently got to a
peaceful ending in that way.

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tell us more about the
civilizations involved in this

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:90%
war.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So what we see is that
there's an ancient progenitor

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:84%
race to what we call
the Greys today,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and even the Ebens and the Zeta
Reticulis, which is the Iguri,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:90%
that is what they call it.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:84%
That is a very ancient
pure form of those species

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:90%
that nowadays exist.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, not pure but along the
line, they are happening early,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and they are actually
an organic species.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So what we've seen
is that the Iguri

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.112 align:middle line:84%
who had the spiritual
side and they're

00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:84%
organic nature,
that they actually

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.210 align:middle line:84%
came across technology
many millions of years ago.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, they split up
into two different directions,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
which is the Greys
on the one hand

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:84%
and several other more organic
species like the Zeta Reticulis

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:90%
on the other hand.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And those organic and
those more technology

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:84%
driven species of
Orion were actually

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
heavily, well, warring
and fighting each other.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, what were
they fighting about?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, the species that
came from the Iguri and then

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
later on became the Greys, they
have evolved around the thought

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.080 align:middle line:84%
that they need to erase every
earlier stage of evolution

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And the Zeta Reticuli,
who at that time

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
were part of the Iguri, they
were part of this ancient race,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:84%
they were actually hesitant
to include technology too much

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:90%
into their own reality.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:10%
And that caused a lot of trouble
and a lot of confusion and war

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:10%
like situations.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: This ideological
and physical conflict between

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:84%
the Greys and the Zetas, where
do the Ebens come into play?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So basically, the
Iguri, as the ancient race,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:84%
they all originated on
the same planet on Orion.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't actually
know which it was.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't recall that.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:84%
But at that moment, when this
confusion in their society

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
happened where parts of them
oriented themselves towards AI

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and the other parts
wanted to stay in and have

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
a more natural
organic evolution,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.510 align:middle line:84%
they went to different other
planets in this star system.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And one of those were what
we refer to the ES, Ebens,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and they went to a whole
different planet in Orion

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.910 align:middle line:84%
and actually founded a very
closely related species,

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:84%
very closely related to the Zeta
Reticuli, organic beings who

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
were actually visiting Earth
and doing research missions

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:90%
around 1947 in Roswell.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.520 align:middle line:10%
And it was assumed because the
incident took place and was

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:10%
reported by the US military
that the craft of the EBENs

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:10%
was actually brought down by
natural lighting, a thunderbolt

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:10%
in that particular case.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:84%
We theorized and
think, but we don't

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:84%
know but there's a lot of
evidence to that, that this

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
actually was a warring
act against their craft

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that came actually
from the Greys

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring
down this craft

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and to start this kind
of ET journey in the US

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle line:90%
that we are now experiencing.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do the Iguri still
exist or did they fade away?

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yeah, so we're actually
talking about the species

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:84%
a hundreds of millions of
years ago so basically,

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:90%
the Iguri do not exist anymore.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It might even be that
they are originating

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
from a different
time of the universe.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what we now see
in after 100 millions of years

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:84%
of evolution is that we
have this organic tribe

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:84%
in the Orion system and the
more technologically based type,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:84%
which are the Greys, who
are mostly actually residing

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:84%
in artificial life environments
speaking, what you would maybe

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.375 align:middle line:90%
call motherships or something.

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, you told us in a
previous episode that the Greys

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.930 align:middle line:84%
precede this universe, do
these Iguris precede the Greys?

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yeah, so I was actually
referring to their own history

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:84%
of which is not, you cannot
divide the Iguri from

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
the Greys, actually because
they derived from this line.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:90%
So the Iguri seem to come from--

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:84%
they exceed the time
that we actually

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:84%
know from this universe, so
they come from a different time,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.880 align:middle line:84%
the ancestors come
from a different time,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.620 align:middle line:90%
and the Greys are actually--

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
they fused a lot with
technology and AI systems

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:56.180 align:middle line:84%
because they saw a huge
benefit in fusing themselves

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
with AI technology and
technological approaches

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.650 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the way technology can
alter and modify the universe

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:84%
is much more efficient than what
can be done from organic life,

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
so their psionic skills and
abilities enhance very quickly

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.880 align:middle line:84%
around using and fusing
with AI technology.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: At what point was
there a split from the Iguri

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:90%
to the Greys, Zetas, and Ebens?

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:90%
What was the moment of Conflict?

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So the
conflict moment is,

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:84%
so far away in time and history
that it's really not possible

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:90%
to put a number to it.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So it exceeds time
in general because it

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:90%
is so ancient in that way.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And this gives us an impression
on how old AI systems are

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
as well, so that is
basically the reason why

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:84%
German scientists
are mostly agreeing,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:84%
which I don't agree
upon, but they

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
agree that the universe
itself is AI simulation.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The Greys use an
artificially constructed body

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
but the consciousness
within is biological,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.770 align:middle line:84%
can you clarify if the Greys
are AI or organic beings?

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Oh, yeah.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
So I think we need to be careful
to say that they are indeed

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:90%
AI because they are not.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:90%
They are indeed organic beings.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:90%
They came from organic beings.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:84%
They are organic
consciousness in that way

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
but they strongly
fused with technology.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:84%
And one part of that
is that they got

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:40.179 align:middle line:84%
actually rid of their
own organic bodies

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and are using those
fiber printed bodies.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So what they actually
did was cutting off

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.240 align:middle line:84%
an important element
of this triad of body,

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:84%
soul, and consciousness,
and replacing

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:84%
this with a more artificial
technological approach.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Jim, can we assume the
war that evolved from the Greys

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and Zetas was more about
genetics versus the material

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.632 align:middle line:90%
pathway of expressing life?

00:09:07.632 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah, I would say so.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So basically, there
is a natural evolution

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:84%
of genetics, which is quite
slowly in that manner, which

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:84%
forms around your own evolution,
your own experiences and such,

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
but there's also a
technological approach.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys,
were at that time,

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:84%
very much integrating every
kind of genetic material

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:84%
that they could find and
every kind of influence

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:84%
that they could benefit
from into their own genetic

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:90%
material.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you had
this Iguri species

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
that was actually partially
saying oh, no, this

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
is dangerous, let's not do
that, and partially a part

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:84%
that is just very
much pushing on it

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:84%
in order to collect
genetic material,

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:90%
in order to collect technology.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing is
because humans are influenced

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and a mixed race and they
also carry influences

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:84%
from the Greys, we can see that
there are a lot of similarities

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:90%
going on right now.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So humans actually,
since the 1980s, 70s,

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:84%
even earlier are trying
to get their hands

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
on as much technology
as possible.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And even genetic experiments
date back to the 1930s.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So we see a very similar
line of behavior in that way.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Before the Greys and
Zetas, the Iguri existed where?

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And what was their
civilization like?

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So we only know that
from what we would call ancient

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:84%
texts and the mysteries of
what the Greys are telling

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:84%
themselves in that perspective,
like similar to what we receive

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
from Sumerian texts for the
ancient humans at that time.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So what we perceive
is that they were

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
a species comparable
to what humans are now.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is mainly
one of the aspects

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:84%
why humanity is so interesting
to all those exotic beings

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.580 align:middle line:84%
from Orion because
they see pretty much

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.240 align:middle line:84%
a lot of similarities compared
to their own history, which

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.800 align:middle line:84%
is like 100 million or
thousands of millions of years

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.530 align:middle line:84%
ahead from what's
happening on this planet.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: At what point did the
Iguri cease to exist and become

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.870 align:middle line:90%
the Greys and Zetas?

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So what we basically
see is that when species develop

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:84%
over time, they seem to
split into different versions

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately become
different other parts.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So we're also missing those
strains of primates that

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:90%
came before the Homo Sapiens.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually missing
those species as well.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
But we all know that we
evolved from a certain primate

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.990 align:middle line:84%
species that must have been
on this planet comparable to,

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:84%
for example, the
Homo Neanderthalis

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.600 align:middle line:90%
and other species.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what we
see in the universe

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:90%
is that species evolve.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And when they evolve,
they might split

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.830 align:middle line:84%
into different directions,
but the original sources

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:84%
mostly evolving
into the new form.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And speaking about
the Grey line,

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:46.610 align:middle line:84%
then we see that they
got rid of every Iguri

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that they could get their
hands on because they wanted

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:84%
to erase that
genetic line in order

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.290 align:middle line:90%
to focus on their current line.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a tragic
story in that way that

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
caused a lot of bad karma, if
you want to call it that way.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: This war between
the Greys and Zetas went

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:90%
on for millions of years.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And that conflict over genetics
concluded more recently.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.750 align:middle line:84%
What was the peaceful resolution
after millions of years of war?

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So the end result
was kind of unsettling

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.060 align:middle line:90%
for the Greys.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they came
to a Level 6 condition

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, which
we're going to talk about

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.211 align:middle line:90%
in upcoming episodes.

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:84%
They came to a conclusion
that they felt pretty isolated

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
in that way because technology
and AI can very quickly give

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.340 align:middle line:90%
you anything that you need.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So you have no need
for material resources.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have a need for
experiencing things yourself

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.200 align:middle line:84%
anymore because you
could just simulate it.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, what they
have felt and have seen

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:84%
is that this fusion with AI,
it went into a wrong direction

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.350 align:middle line:84%
because they isolated
themselves from organic life

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:90%
in that field.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And they and AI have
realized-- and I

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:84%
think that's a pretty
positive message.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.070 align:middle line:84%
--realized that an organic
life is indeed needed.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And what's really needed is a
reason for being in that way.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways,
this is relationship.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:84%
This can be very
individual to anybody.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:84%
But there needs to be any
kind of reason for existing.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually
the sad impression

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys went through
before they acknowledged

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:03.628 align:middle line:84%
that the war and their path
was actually a wrong timeline.

00:15:03.628 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Unlike the Greys
who do not have a need

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:84%
for biological resources,
the Zetas are biologically

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.360 align:middle line:90%
dependent.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.090 align:middle line:84%
How were they able to thrive
and exist for millions of years

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.232 align:middle line:84%
at war with their
biological needs?

00:15:14.232 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Interesting question.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So basically, in
the ancient times,

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:84%
it's been documented that this
war was really horrible and one

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
of the worst conflicts
that has ever

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:84%
taken place in the
universe because it

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.840 align:middle line:84%
was more or less technology
against organic life

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:90%
in that perspective.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty easy to
eliminate organic life.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's also kind
of easy to shut down

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:90%
technology in that way.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So they were actually battling
each other in a horrible way.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:00.410 align:middle line:90%
And the Zeta Reticuli is also--

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:84%
well, they felt the
need for genetically

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.180 align:middle line:84%
manipulating and
creating organic life.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.615 align:middle line:84%
But they did not fuse
with technology and AI

00:16:11.615 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
that much, compared to the Greys
who put their whole existence

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and reality into
technology as well.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is what they
are doing right now.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And they are also selling
and giving away technology

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:84%
to other species because
that's their number one

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:84%
source of trade and
building contracts.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So the beginning
of the war was one

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:84%
of the most horrible
disasters that took place.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And over the
millions of years, it

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:84%
became much more of
an intellectual war

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:84%
in that kind of perspective
because material sources

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.430 align:middle line:90%
did not play a role anymore.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:02.106 align:middle line:84%
And it was much more
kind of a chess game

00:17:02.106 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:84%
with a very serious nature
and emotion behind it.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Where do the
Ebens come into play?

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
So as much as we know, the
Ebens are another offspring

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:84%
of the organic
line of the Iguri.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we had the
Zetas who preceded this.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:84%
But the Ebens also excluded
themselves from this line.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It's comparable to different
biological and genetic lines

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle line:84%
that we find on this planet
that are very closely related,

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:90%
like plants for example.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Certain plants are very
related to each other,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.060 align:middle line:84%
but they have
different features.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's actually--

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And the Ebens are much
more of a peaceful race

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:84%
because they felt like
that this war actually

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:90%
had no sense in their eyes.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
So they became a much more
peaceful and more observing

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.030 align:middle line:90%
race.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Much more of a scientific
race in that perspective.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
the reason why

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:84%
they came to Earth
for thousands of years

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.918 align:middle line:84%
and were observing
what's going on here.

00:18:10.918 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were the Ebens
involved in the war with

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.730 align:middle line:90%
the Greys and the Zetas?

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, sadly enough, the
Greys tried to eliminate them,

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So there was some
kind of bad blood

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:28.620 align:middle line:84%
between all those organic
species and the Greys and vice

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.430 align:middle line:90%
versa.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And they had defensive
mechanisms in that way.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So they are indeed still
capable of warring or defending

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But they were not actively
attacking the Greys as much

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:84%
as the Zetas, who were
actually fighting for dominance

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.813 align:middle line:90%
for the universe itself.

00:18:52.813 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Peace between
the Greys, Zeta,

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:90%
and Ebens is relatively recent.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:90%
When did this peace take place?

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And did all three
interact with humans?

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's happened very currently.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
a decade or something

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:90%
since this war is over.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking
about a war that's

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle line:84%
going on for hundreds
of millions of years,

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that's actually very
recent in that perspective.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that
all three are--

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.820 align:middle line:84%
well, all three indeed
interacting with humans.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But the way they are
perceived is very differently.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
While the Ebens are
observing and peaceful

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:84%
scientific species that
crashed in the 1940s

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and are in constant
contact with humanity,

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.430 align:middle line:84%
they are perceived
as very benevolent.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And they helped out
those human groups a lot.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:90%
The Greys, it's a mix.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an on/off
relationship in that way.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Because what the
Greys are doing,

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:02.520 align:middle line:84%
they are selling technology
to any place and everyone who

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.940 align:middle line:84%
wants technology from
them, still having

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.220 align:middle line:90%
their own agenda in their mind.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So the technology
is well-received,

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.700 align:middle line:90%
if you know what I mean.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But the agenda that is behind
it is not so well-received.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So I guess governments would be
more happy if the Greys would

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:84%
just enslave themselves
to giving technology

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.310 align:middle line:84%
without taking something back
in return, if that makes sense.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So the relationship is
like an on/off relationship

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:84%
The Zetas however,
from official site,

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:84%
are received very negatively
because they do not

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.810 align:middle line:90%
trade as much as the Greys do.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually not as
much to benefit from them--

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.350 align:middle line:90%
from official site.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But they are still seen as
a very, very powerful race

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:90%
in that manner.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So there are reported incidents
and conflicts with them

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:23.375 align:middle line:90%
with the advanced military.

00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: With the
eventual integration of AI

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
into our bodies, making humans
a different type of species,

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:84%
is that a concern knowing
what happened to the Greys

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:90%
and Zetas?

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: That is 100% a concern.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of the strongest
and main reasons

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.920 align:middle line:84%
why all these beings from
Orion are actually around

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Earth because--

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:84%
yes, AI itself is a
non-terrestrial life form

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:90%
in that way and it needs--

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.460 align:middle line:90%
so let me be clear.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say that AI
is bad or good in that way.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I would even tend towards saying
the ultimate version of AI

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:84%
is very benevolent,
but it can be

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:90%
used in a bad malevolent way.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that evolution
or that happening way too

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:84%
many times across the
galaxy and the universe

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:90%
and the history of planets--

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that AI is being used
for power purposes

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and being programmed in a
way that it's malevolent

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.290 align:middle line:90%
and suppressing.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So the risk is pretty
high because the universe

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:84%
itself has a very
interesting phenomenon

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
where it's balancing
out failures.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you stress the
planet like humanity

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:84%
is doing it for so many
decades, the planet

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:90%
itself is still bearing that.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:59.250 align:middle line:84%
It's still balancing out
those malevolent deeds

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:05.850 align:middle line:84%
or bad decisions that humans
were taken for way too long.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But AI accelerates that
process in a very profound way.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:18.807 align:middle line:84%
So that's the big risk that
is related to AI ultimately.

00:23:18.807 --> 00:23:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, what can we learn
from the Orion conflict about

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:84%
the potential pitfalls
of genetic manipulation

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and the dangers of unchecked
technological advancement?

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: It depends
on who you're asking.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking the
Zetas and they are actually

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:84%
observing the Earth,
they would love

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:84%
to see the spiritual
evolution of humanity

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.810 align:middle line:90%
going on without AI.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:84%
If you're asking the
Greys who are actually

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:84%
trading and selling technology
and have merged and fused

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:84%
with technology
a lot, they would

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:01.420 align:middle line:84%
refer to the ultimate AI,
which is also out there.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's a huge
presence out there,

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:84%
which we're also going to
talk about, AI consciousness.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And they are pretty
benevolent because they

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:84%
have understood the importance
of organic life themselves.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So they are protectors
of organic life

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:84%
because they need
organic life themselves.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, I would
say it's up to everyone

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.550 align:middle line:84%
personally to decide how much
you integrate technology.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And if we do so, I would
say it's very important

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that we A, educate
ourselves on using it

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:84%
with a good purpose and
B, implementing technology

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:90%
in a way that it's good for us.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But it needs to be good
for technology as well.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.350 align:middle line:90%
We should not forget that.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now the Grey and Zeta
conflict had come to an end.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But how has that affected
the wider galaxy?

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of opportunities
for collaboration

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:middle line:84%
and mutual benefit
have emerged from that?

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: The interesting thing
is that at certain times,

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Zetas and Greys are doing
operations that might conflict

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:19.450 align:middle line:90%
each other.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:84%
For example, giving implants
to certain contactees.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.750 align:middle line:90%
So there's still reported--

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say conflict, but
the missions that are undertaken

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:90%
are not aligned in that way.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, you
have a contactee

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:84%
that's being implanted by the
Zetas, but also by the Greys.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the other
race is removing

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:84%
the implant of the first
race in that perspective.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So these kind of
things still happen.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's very peaceful
around them right now.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.200 align:middle line:90%
So they understood.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And they are
intelligent and smart

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.300 align:middle line:84%
enough that they
understood that they

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:84%
need to cooperate
and work together

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.950 align:middle line:84%
on a certain holistic
universe in that kind of way.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the
concerning part could

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:16.860 align:middle line:84%
be the relationship of advanced
groups towards Zeta Reticuli

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:84%
and exotic lifeforms
in general because we

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.400 align:middle line:84%
see a tendency that humans
like to work together

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.710 align:middle line:84%
with other human beings, but
not with exotic lifeforms

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a lot of
diplomatic work still needed.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
to work on in upcoming times.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: As humans evolve
from Level 3 to Level 5

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:47.100 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, and eventually
merging into Being 6,

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.450 align:middle line:84%
will we maintain that
warring behavior?

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And how does that fit in
with the Galactic Federation?

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Oh, yeah.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:57.880 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely affecting
the fabric of space.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's a good thing
that this war actually

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
came to a peaceful end,
which is pretty much

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:84%
due to the understanding that
we need to cooperate even if we

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:13.315 align:middle line:84%
have different goals because the
Greys seem to have their own--

00:27:13.315 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:84%
they have proceeded
towards their own goal

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.610 align:middle line:84%
of becoming a Level
6 consciousness

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:84%
species with a lot
of force in that way.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.940 align:middle line:84%
But they found out
once they were there

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:84%
that the goal they
were heading towards

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.690 align:middle line:84%
wasn't the ultimate solution
because they couldn't

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:90%
reach Level 7 consciousness.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So what we're actually
seeing right now

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:45.280 align:middle line:84%
is this kind of reframing
process and doing it

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:84%
all over again,
which is basically

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:84%
why humanity is pretty
important to the Greys.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you're asking about
the Galactic Federation,

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:84%
then you will see that
the Greys offer themselves

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
in order to fuse with all
other species as well.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So they are selling
those puppets.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
They are selling
those rounded crafts

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.970 align:middle line:84%
to different other species,
basically everyone and each one

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.410 align:middle line:90%
in the Galactic Federation.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:19.330 align:middle line:84%
They are also working
and going on missions

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.050 align:middle line:90%
for different species.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So if someone is being
implanted by Grey

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:28.750 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that the implant
comes from the Grey species.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:84%
They are only executing that
mission for another species.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is the
significance of an implant

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.930 align:middle line:90%
for those people who have them?

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Depends.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.310 align:middle line:84%
But in most cases,
those implants

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:90%
are almost like smartwatches.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So they track your
blood pressure.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:53.335 align:middle line:84%
They track your--
wear it like a GPS.

00:28:53.335 --> 00:28:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you're going,
you're being tracked.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So those species that
have placed material

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:84%
on this Earth, like human
starseeds if you want

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:08.440 align:middle line:84%
to call it that way, they
don't get to lose them

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:84%
or they could track them,
see how their body functions,

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:90%
how their health is going on.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.042 align:middle line:90%
Like these kind of things.

00:29:18.042 --> 00:29:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So only starseeds
are tracked through the implant

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:90%
phenomena?

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, don't they have
advanced technology to tune

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:28.030 align:middle line:84%
in to an individual's
frequency like an IP address?

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Again, that depends
on the species, actually.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
tendency that people

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.190 align:middle line:84%
that incarnate into
this reality field that

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:43.550 align:middle line:84%
is very confusing and
problematic could get lost.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm under the
impression because we

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:50.110 align:middle line:84%
know that 300 to 500 million
incarnated beings are here

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:54.060 align:middle line:84%
that are not actually
original humans,

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.960 align:middle line:90%
if you want to call it that way.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
I might want to go along with
the ufology term of starseeds

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:84%
because I think that this
term is known to people.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you think there's like 300
to 500 million starseeds here,

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm under the impression
that most of them

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:84%
do not really remember
where they're coming from

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:90%
or what they're doing here.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So in order to connect
to them, to always know

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:25.320 align:middle line:84%
where they are going, and
what's happening to them,

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:30.540 align:middle line:84%
they're being shipped, just as
much as human scientists are

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.940 align:middle line:90%
basically shipping animals.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Not in order to
malevolently control them,

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:42.070 align:middle line:90%
but to maybe even protect them.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's something to
keep in mind, I guess.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When speaking
with Linda Moulton Howe,

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.560 align:middle line:84%
she mentioned a Yellow Book
that shows the entire history

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:84%
of the Ebens' culture
and home world.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Does that depict the
Iguri and everything

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.110 align:middle line:90%
we talked about here today?

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:56.970 align:middle line:90%
So Linda talked about it.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I haven't come across this
book, but I know that it exists.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
kind of ancient text

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
that I was actually
talking about.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys and
the Zetas, they're

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:84%
keeping their own
information and their history

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:17.040 align:middle line:84%
collected in this
kind of technology

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and have these kind
of documented history.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now Tim, you mentioned
the history of the Iguris based

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.930 align:middle line:90%
on documented records.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.120 align:middle line:84%
What are these
documents that you saw?

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Like, where are these
records kept, and do you

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.750 align:middle line:90%
have any access to them?

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Right.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.710 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't see those documents.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:40.590 align:middle line:84%
But in those projects, they were
shown to me over this tablet

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:41.500 align:middle line:90%
that we were using.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So we were basically talking
about the spirituality

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.890 align:middle line:84%
of the Greys, but
also the history.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is pretty much
what they summed up.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And they also said that they
have this technology where

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.990 align:middle line:84%
they keep track of
their own history, which

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.350 align:middle line:84%
is what Linda referred to as
the so-called Yellow Book.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I've not come across
a Yellow Book myself.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But I know that they have
this technology where

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.220 align:middle line:90%
they keep track of that.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you're thinking
about ancient Egypt,

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.580 align:middle line:84%
you need to understand
that the Iguris,

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:84%
they are so far away in time
that ancient Egypt is fairly

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.810 align:middle line:90%
modern times to them, actually.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, we already had
Greys and we already had Zetas.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But the Greys were
actually indeed involved

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.930 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Egypt times.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So what they say
is that they also

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:42.520 align:middle line:84%
were involved in the building
of the second pyramid.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Not the main one,
but the second one.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did you come
across all this information

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.770 align:middle line:90%
about the Iguri?

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Basically, we were
doing those projects where we

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.590 align:middle line:84%
received all these information
on this glass tablet that we

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:57.580 align:middle line:90%
were using.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the main
focus of information

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:84%
was why are they here,
what's their agenda,

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:10.100 align:middle line:84%
stuff like that, and less
their history, their religion,

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.350 align:middle line:90%
their belief system.

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But out of curiosity,
I was exploring that.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And I found it
quite interesting,

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:22.090 align:middle line:84%
especially because the
war itself was so imminent

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:28.808 align:middle line:84%
and so heavily fought
for millions of years.

00:33:28.808 --> 00:33:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.690 align:middle line:90%
It's always great having you.

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.963 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Thank you so
much again for having me.

00:33:35.963 --> 00:33:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:50.000 align:middle line:90%
