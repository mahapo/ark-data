00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: We've
all heard about cloning.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.359 align:middle line:10%
But what if you or your friend
or someone you met is a clone?

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.818 align:middle line:10%
Would you even know it?

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.363 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to "Cosmic
Disclosure" Emery Smith.

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:30.155 align:middle line:10%
Hi, Emery.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.198 align:middle line:10%
Good to see you again.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.073 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Good to
see you, too, George.

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:32.991 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:36.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These clones that
could be just about anything,

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:37.204 align:middle line:90%
all walks of life.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:38.413 align:middle line:90%
They could be ETs.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:40.374 align:middle line:84%
They could be humans
that are cloned.

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:42.167 align:middle line:90%
What do we know about that?

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:46.088 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, cloning has been
done before I even came along.

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:49.508 align:middle line:10%
They've been cloning
animals for quite a while.

00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:52.803 align:middle line:10%
And in the hybrid programs
that I was associated with,

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:55.305 align:middle line:10%
they were cloning
not only species,

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:10%
like plants and animals,
but they were also

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.853 align:middle line:10%
regenerating tissues
of extraterrestrials

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:04.855 align:middle line:10%
and growing them and
then cloning them.

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:07.985 align:middle line:84%
And then they started cloning
humans a very long time ago.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:12.656 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting now that in
the news after talking about

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
this a few times that now
they're coming forward.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.619 align:middle line:10%
China just has been
doing it forever

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.538 align:middle line:10%
but in their
underground facilities,

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:22.749 align:middle line:10%
cloning people and
cloning, of course,

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.168 align:middle line:10%
you heard about they
cloned their first primate.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:10%
And, hey, if they
can clone a primate--

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.631 align:middle line:10%
that verifies what
I'm talking about--

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.383 align:middle line:10%
well, they can
definitely clone a human.

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:35.387 align:middle line:84%
And they're are also
growing humans for organs.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And you know, big
controversy behind this.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.350 align:middle line:90%
But clones are everywhere.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.396 align:middle line:84%
Human, extraterrestrial,
they're wandering all over.

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:46.732 align:middle line:84%
Some people refer to
these as doppelgangers

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:51.027 align:middle line:84%
because they can grow a human
to look like someone and mind

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:55.157 align:middle line:84%
program and implant them with
circuitry and things like this,

00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:57.491 align:middle line:84%
and they will really
think they had this life

00:01:57.491 --> 00:02:02.873 align:middle line:84%
and implant them into a business
or into whatever organization

00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:03.874 align:middle line:90%
they want.

00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:07.461 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, many times you'll
be walking down the street,

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.211 align:middle line:90%
you'll hear people say on--

00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.173 align:middle line:84%
you could look
this up on online--

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:12.841 align:middle line:84%
man, this person
looks just like me.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:13.633 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:14.718 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Like why is that?

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:16.219 align:middle line:90%
How did they get there?

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.265 align:middle line:84%
And they have no idea
that they're probably were

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:21.808 align:middle line:90%
part of this cloning program.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.477 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, is
there a hidden agenda?

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.145 align:middle line:84%
Because you've just
brought something up

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.522 align:middle line:84%
that just scares the
living daylights out of me.

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:31.985 align:middle line:84%
And that is to replace
us with a clone

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.696 align:middle line:84%
and who would know
the difference?

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:37.656 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This is one
that probably only times,

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:41.661 align:middle line:84%
George, that you got
me on a negative part

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.456 align:middle line:90%
because there is an agenda.

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds
and hundreds of people

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.796 align:middle line:84%
being cloned in underground
facilities in Australia

00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:53.965 align:middle line:84%
and in some parts of
the United States.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:58.095 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing this for
some reason, which obviously

00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:00.972 align:middle line:84%
is diabolical, because
there's no reason

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:05.936 align:middle line:84%
to clone people and
keep it a secret

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:10.732 align:middle line:84%
and make horrible experiments
on these people and mind implant

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:11.817 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.028 align:middle line:84%
The biggest problem they're
having is some clones when they

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.781 align:middle line:84%
pick like the one clone
to do an experiment

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:21.952 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they'll make 20 of
these clones of the one person.

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:25.079 align:middle line:84%
And as these clones
grow older and they

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.332 align:middle line:84%
train them, what
starts to happen

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:30.877 align:middle line:84%
is they start to
have memory recall.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:34.714 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you clone the
president and put this clone

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:90%
him in the White House?

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.636 align:middle line:84%
You put them in
Russia, in the Kremlin,

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.596 align:middle line:84%
and you put them
all over the place?

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.099 align:middle line:84%
And what if there's
a company behind it

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.977 align:middle line:84%
that wants to control
and dominate the planet?

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:48.853 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There is I
think a possibility

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.273 align:middle line:90%
that this could happen.

00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:55.067 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's likely
that it's happening right now.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:58.905 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more of
corporate domination actually

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.574 align:middle line:84%
that's higher than
the president.

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:01.408 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I get it.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So it's more important
that these corporations are

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.957 align:middle line:84%
inserting these clones that
are programmed that look like

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:14.754 align:middle line:84%
people and having these people
unfortunately terminated--

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.423 align:middle line:84%
they're terminating because
you have to terminate someone

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.341 align:middle line:90%
to replace someone.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.636 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who in the heck
concocted this kind of scheme?

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:22.762 align:middle line:90%
The deep state?

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.181 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has got be behind this.

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:28.185 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I mean it is this
pop culture term, deep state,

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:32.063 align:middle line:84%
which for me is just the
major corporations that

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:36.526 align:middle line:84%
have their own agendas and
that may be influenced also

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.236 align:middle line:90%
by a higher force as well.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.988 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long has
that been happening?

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Years?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.116 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, my goodness,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.744 align:middle line:84%
when I found out
about it in 1990--

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.413 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 29 years ago?

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:51.957 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They must have been
doing it at least two decades

00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:52.751 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.628 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.505 align:middle line:90%
The technology is that advanced?

00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.465 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:84%
They're able to 3D
print now individuals

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.346 align:middle line:90%
and people over a few months.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:07.557 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we're primarily
concerned about humans cloning

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.392 align:middle line:90%
humans for their own purpose.

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:10.185 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:13.605 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what
about ETs cloning humans,

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.524 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of
inject themselves.

00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.359 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I mean, it's possible.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.194 align:middle line:84%
I'm not aware of any
extraterrestrials

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:22.322 align:middle line:90%
that are cloning humans.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.116 align:middle line:84%
I am aware of
extraterrestrial beings that

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:28.119 align:middle line:90%
are collecting DNA from humans.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.371 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's been ongoing.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:33.667 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Ongoing for a good
reason, not for a bad reason.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, they can
make anything, too.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.089 align:middle line:84%
I mean they are already at
an advanced level of science

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.551 align:middle line:84%
that we would not understand
to do that if they needed to.

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:45.887 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is a clone,
Emery, basically a human

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.515 align:middle line:90%
being identical to the clone?

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.392 align:middle line:84%
And so they eat,
they sleep, they

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.143 align:middle line:84%
do everything that
a human known does?

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:52.936 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
No, because they still have to
go through the growing process.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.942 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a lot of work.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.318 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
speed that up?

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.737 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they
have sped it up.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.781 align:middle line:90%
But there's a problem.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:09.661 align:middle line:84%
They can make a George
Noory in about eight years,

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:10.662 align:middle line:90%
that you're--

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:11.830 align:middle line:90%
from baby to you.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.622 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:18.628 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The problem is the
brain cannot grow that fast

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.005 align:middle line:90%
as the body can.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So all your bodily tissues,
such as your bones and muscles

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:32.225 align:middle line:84%
and tendons and things like
anything made of collagen,

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:36.813 align:middle line:84%
can be very rapidly accelerated
with the technologies

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:37.939 align:middle line:90%
they have.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And the learning, you know,
you can learn pretty quickly.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.529 align:middle line:84%
But there seems to be a problem
they're having with the brains.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:45.655 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the agenda?

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.699 align:middle line:84%
What's the mission
here to clone?

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.702 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You know, I
don't know that agenda.

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:52.746 align:middle line:84%
I can just give you
my opinion on it

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.665 align:middle line:84%
that they would use
it for a fear type

00:06:55.665 --> 00:07:01.546 align:middle line:84%
thing, such as a fake alien
invasion, definitely control,

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:06.134 align:middle line:84%
like a secret army, you know,
a secret group of assassins,

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:10.347 align:middle line:84%
things like this that, you
know, is very frightful.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:15.435 align:middle line:84%
Just to know that they're
doing this on a mass production

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:19.314 align:middle line:84%
conveyor belt is
horrifying enough.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:23.151 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you have to
take care of this being.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.361 align:middle line:90%
You have to feed this being.

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:25.153 align:middle line:90%
You have to train this being.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:25.987 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's alive.

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.489 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's a real person.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:28.281 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then like I said,
some of them have recall.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.455 align:middle line:84%
And then the recall messes
up with their psyche.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.999 align:middle line:90%
But it's still in the--

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:84%
it's done in the early stages,
but it's not always successful,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.712 align:middle line:90%
I'll say.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:45.006 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens to
the human soul, Emery,

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.633 align:middle line:90%
in this kind of situation?

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:50.887 align:middle line:84%
Does the clone have
a separate soul?

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:54.432 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe that the
clone has a separate soul,

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.226 align:middle line:90%
a separate personality.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:08:01.439 align:middle line:84%
But it is also linked
to its twin, its clone,

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:06.027 align:middle line:84%
its other clone, because it's
been shown already that when

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:11.157 align:middle line:84%
you take DNA in
this glass of water

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:16.287 align:middle line:84%
and you put this purified water
over here that it automatically

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:19.165 align:middle line:84%
starts to have the DNA
in this glass of water,

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.126 align:middle line:84%
whether you're shooting
laser light through it

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:22.836 align:middle line:90%
or using sound frequency.

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:26.005 align:middle line:84%
So if you're taking
any DNA from anyone,

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:84%
it has a hard drive in
this DNA that that DNA is

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.721 align:middle line:90%
going to recall some things.

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:38.058 align:middle line:84%
That's how we sometimes contract
illnesses that our grandmothers

00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:40.102 align:middle line:90%
and grandfathers have.

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:40.979 align:middle line:90%
It's in the lineage.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.563 align:middle line:90%
It's in the DNA.

00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:45.942 align:middle line:84%
So what's not to say
that the programming

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle line:84%
that the original person had
could easily be in the clone

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:54.868 align:middle line:84%
and actually have
traits of this person?

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.786 align:middle line:84%
As far as the soul
and spirit, that's

00:08:56.786 --> 00:09:00.039 align:middle line:84%
still a very confusing
thing for me to understand.

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:04.919 align:middle line:84%
But these clones
do have feelings.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.421 align:middle line:90%
They do have emotions.

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:09.507 align:middle line:84%
They do have everything a
normal person would have.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:13.219 align:middle line:84%
And they have the choice to
make a spiritual decision

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:18.016 align:middle line:84%
if they wanted to be a religious
person or something like this.

00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:20.769 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they have
the memory of the person

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.479 align:middle line:90%
they've been cloned?

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.689 align:middle line:90%
Or do they also have their own?

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.817 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They have their
own life experience memory.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:31.404 align:middle line:84%
And most of them,
80% of them have

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:35.158 align:middle line:84%
some sort of recall of
who they were before.

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:36.868 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
know they're a clone?

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:37.827 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, some do.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.037 align:middle line:90%
Some figure it out.

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:42.332 align:middle line:84%
Some are actually
soldiers of cloning.

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.793 align:middle line:84%
So they actually are raised
for certain missions.

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean if a
clone of Emery Smith

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:49.964 align:middle line:84%
came in here right
now and looked at you,

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:53.259 align:middle line:84%
would that clone
think he was you?

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:57.388 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: He could
possibly think that.

00:09:57.388 --> 00:10:02.185 align:middle line:84%
I've met two, in the military,
two individuals that I

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:05.939 align:middle line:84%
was very shocked to
have seen face to face

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:90%
because it was definitely me.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You looked at yourself?

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:12.737 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:14.489 align:middle line:90%
And it was very interesting.

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:16.074 align:middle line:90%
And people noticed this.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:19.786 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't something that
was deep in the projects.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:23.832 align:middle line:84%
This was on top of working
at Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.917 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.502 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We became
kind of friends

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.254 align:middle line:84%
for a very, very
short period of time.

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:32.173 align:middle line:84%
And then he disappeared
or got relocated.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:35.844 align:middle line:84%
But it was very interesting
that people picked up on this

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:39.931 align:middle line:90%
and saw the exact similarities.

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:43.685 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a possible
way that this is happening.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.812 align:middle line:84%
But his personality
was completely

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:46.813 align:middle line:90%
the opposite of mine.

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.773 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would there
be another cloned you?

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:90%
What was the purpose?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.734 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I don't know.

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:54.362 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if that was also--

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.698 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's possible
the universe, too,

00:10:56.698 --> 00:11:00.451 align:middle line:84%
with doppelgangers that
these people are born

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:03.663 align:middle line:90%
on separate parts of the world.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:06.499 align:middle line:84%
And it could be just
an energetic thing

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.794 align:middle line:84%
that they were born at the
same time and the same energy

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.463 align:middle line:84%
and the same alignment
with the stars.

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.966 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, there also
is the natural cloning

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.969 align:middle line:84%
of what I call these
doppelgangers you see.

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:20.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
want to replace you?

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:23.057 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't believe they're
cloning me for any reason

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:25.268 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:26.185 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any--

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.271 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I mean if
there's two more of you--

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.273 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't have
any intuition of that.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But to see someone
that's identical to you

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.820 align:middle line:90%
is a very startling thing.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And this was when I
was very, very young,

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.824 align:middle line:90%
of course, in my early 20s.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.326 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can clones mate?

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.286 align:middle line:90%
Do they have children?

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.955 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: A clone is
just like when we clone

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.708 align:middle line:90%
a primate or a pig or a cow.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
They still have all the same
organs, all the same things.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.462 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The ability to breed.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.255 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The only thing
that's different is

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:58.676 align:middle line:84%
some of the clones are implanted
and they're using circuitry

00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:03.723 align:middle line:84%
and biocircuitry to be either
maybe sometimes mind controlled

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:07.769 align:middle line:84%
or to carry out one-way
missions, we call them.

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:11.022 align:middle line:84%
Or they're just definitely
going to die on this mission,

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:13.358 align:middle line:84%
but they're going to accomplish
whatever that agenda is.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.859 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
secret labs do you

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:18.363 align:middle line:84%
think there are on this
planet performing cloning?

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I know of six.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.531 align:middle line:90%
So there's probably--

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:21.741 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the planet?

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:25.036 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's probably
double that or more.

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:27.413 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Emery, how
prevalent are ET clones?

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: ET clones
are very prevalent.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.669 align:middle line:90%
That's just something they do.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:35.254 align:middle line:90%
They've been doing it forever.

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:38.007 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of
interesting how many

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:40.468 align:middle line:90%
ET races all look the same.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:41.761 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:42.679 align:middle line:90%
They're remarkable.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it's like,
well, why is that?

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:50.395 align:middle line:84%
Were they perfecting
their super agenda

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:55.441 align:middle line:84%
for creating a
stronger person maybe?

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.194 align:middle line:84%
Were they getting
DNA, manipulating it,

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:01.614 align:middle line:84%
so the human would
be the superhuman

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:06.703 align:middle line:84%
and we'll all be this
amazing super creature

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:10.873 align:middle line:84%
that does not get sick, that
can live for 500 years--

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:12.041 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be nice.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:16.379 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Born with all the
technology already built in.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:19.465 align:middle line:84%
So I think there are
some races out there that

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:84%
are of the same clone that
just because of the bodies

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.724 align:middle line:84%
I've seen and worked on,
it's just too identical.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.226 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know twins
who are identical.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.186 align:middle line:84%
They played games
when they were kids.

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:34.897 align:middle line:84%
They play games
when they're adults.

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:37.692 align:middle line:84%
They tried to trick
boyfriends and girlfriends.

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:40.028 align:middle line:84%
Do these clones have
personality like that?

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they play
games and have fun?

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I mean, they
have this connection, of course,

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.617 align:middle line:90%
like twins do.

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:48.119 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:50.079 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very
familiar with twins.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.956 align:middle line:90%
And I've known a lot of twins.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And I've studied this
in depth that there

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.298 align:middle line:84%
is this connection energetically
because of the same vibratory

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:01.591 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:06.095 align:middle line:84%
However, their genes and
genetic makeup can change.

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:09.474 align:middle line:84%
And a good example of
this is a recent report

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:12.727 align:middle line:84%
of the astronaut who
had a twin brother,

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:16.564 align:middle line:84%
and he was sent to space and
lived in space for however

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.691 align:middle line:84%
long, came back,
they measured the DNA

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.401 align:middle line:84%
and there was
differences in the DNA.

00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was bizarre.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.696 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Now that's--
how can you change DNA?

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.656 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Different heights
and stuff like that.

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:26.449 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:30.995 align:middle line:84%
So DNA can be manipulated
by electromagnetic fields

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:37.293 align:middle line:84%
and radiation and living in
different parts of the planet.

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle line:84%
It could be
manipulated, obviously.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.089 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the purpose
of cloning unless there's

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.673 align:middle line:90%
something sinister behind it?

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:45.468 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't see
the logic of why you

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:47.011 align:middle line:90%
would want to clone somebody.

00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:48.888 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, right
now like China is really

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.516 align:middle line:84%
trying to push this
cloning because they want

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:58.022 align:middle line:84%
to grow people for their organs
because 33 people over there

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:00.608 align:middle line:84%
a day die waiting just
to get some organ.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:03.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can't they just grow
the organ without the human?

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:03.528 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:04.987 align:middle line:84%
Well, what they're
doing is they're

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:08.783 align:middle line:84%
trying to find species like
pigs who have a very similar--

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:12.954 align:middle line:84%
that's why we use pig valves,
pig hearts in cardiac surgery.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:18.042 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with the growth
rate of cells, believed or not.

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle line:84%
So as far as what
the agenda is I

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.298 align:middle line:84%
believe the agenda for
the corporate world on top

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:30.388 align:middle line:84%
here is to grow people
clandestinely and harvest

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.765 align:middle line:84%
their organs and sell
them on the black market

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:36.811 align:middle line:84%
or use pigs to
grow a human organ

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:40.398 align:middle line:84%
and then take that one organ
and then put it into the person.

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is a chimera if
it has any human parts in it.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.443 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's a
chimera, that's right.

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:45.236 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:48.739 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The great baseball
great Ted Williams, he died.

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:55.955 align:middle line:10%
His family has his head stored
away at a cryogenic chamber.

00:15:55.955 --> 00:16:00.001 align:middle line:84%
And they're hoping one day
to be able to clone the body

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:03.629 align:middle line:84%
and download the memory
from his real brain, which

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:08.885 align:middle line:84%
is frozen right now, and plant
it into the brain of the clone.

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:09.844 align:middle line:90%
And there he is.

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:12.972 align:middle line:84%
He's Ted Williams all over
again because we are memory.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.515 align:middle line:90%
That's what we are.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.018 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, we're energy.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:19.854 align:middle line:84%
We're an atomic,
crystalline structure

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:84%
that can be rearranged
and re-implanted

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.985 align:middle line:90%
into another living being.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:32.116 align:middle line:84%
That is a kind of a clone
that has not been turned on,

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:90%
as we say in the projects.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.579 align:middle line:84%
So you might have a
body that's fully grown,

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:39.248 align:middle line:84%
that's been growing,
and still have muscle

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:43.628 align:middle line:84%
and can still stand
up right off the table

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:48.007 align:middle line:84%
after 10 years or 8 years
or depending on what it is

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and implant the memory
of a person or--

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.638 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
be remarkable.

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:54.889 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they're
doing it already.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:55.556 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:56.349 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.894 align:middle line:84%
And that's amazing-- this is
kind of like "Avatar" stuff--

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:00.853 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is--

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:01.729 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Like in the movie.

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there's
still something sinister

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:90%
behind this, Emery.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.276 align:middle line:84%
I don't see anything positive
coming from any of this.

00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:08.569 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I don't agree with it.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.279 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's wrong.

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:11.948 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't
sit right with me.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:84%
So I think, you know,
there's other ways

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:84%
to do this where we can
3D print our organs.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.295 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, they're not
letting that technology out.

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:30.549 align:middle line:84%
They just recently
actually posted something

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
after I spoke about this last
year about organ 3D printing.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.889 align:middle line:90%
And they printed the ear.

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.809 align:middle line:90%
They 3D printed an ear.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.477 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't
tell the people

00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:44.981 align:middle line:84%
is, well, what matrix
did you use to print?

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:48.192 align:middle line:84%
They get everyone all
excited because the secret

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:53.447 align:middle line:84%
is how you do that because
you need a lattice.

00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:56.867 align:middle line:84%
You need a matrix for
whatever organ we grow.

00:17:56.867 --> 00:18:00.371 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this already
many times sure them

00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:05.626 align:middle line:84%
growing hearts and livers for
the elites and people that

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:90%
needed--

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.878 align:middle line:90%
VIP types of individuals.

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:09.422 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They get
anything they want.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.967 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they were using
a collagen-based protein

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:84%
structure found in
your blood to do this.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.056 align:middle line:84%
And they would also
sometimes, depending

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:22.393 align:middle line:84%
on what part of the body
that they were growing,

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:26.188 align:middle line:84%
would utilize synthetic
materials, which

00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:28.274 align:middle line:90%
is kind of scary in a way.

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:31.569 align:middle line:84%
But then again, we
have oseointegration.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:35.489 align:middle line:84%
We've already proven
titanium into tissue now.

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:39.535 align:middle line:10%
We can 3D print very small
sponge-like structures

00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:10%
and features in many different
types of biocompatible

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.083 align:middle line:10%
synthetic materials,
not just metals,

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.085 align:middle line:10%
to make a nose or to make--

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:50.087 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They just grow
it right on, don't they?

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:51.464 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They grow
the tissue on.

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.841 align:middle line:84%
So I'll take a
piece of your skin.

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:59.722 align:middle line:84%
And I'll 3D print a lattice,
a matrix of collagen

00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:03.184 align:middle line:84%
or a matrix of platelet rich
plasma and activate that.

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:04.268 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Inject the cells.

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.603 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Inject the cells there.

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.688 align:middle line:84%
And we grow it and then
we can put it right on.

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:10.358 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they have
a new nose or whatever.

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: New nose.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.404 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If a clone breeds with
a clone, what is the offspring?

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:16.405 align:middle line:90%
A clone?

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, that's a good
question, because if you think

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:26.374 align:middle line:84%
about it, was that
clone, number one,

00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:29.585 align:middle line:84%
did it have any lineage
from the other clone?

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:34.423 align:middle line:84%
Because male and female, you
have to look at it that way.

00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:36.008 align:middle line:90%
Where did this clone come from?

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.594 align:middle line:90%
What lineage of DNA?

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:41.347 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
that's like families

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:46.936 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't reproduce together
because it creates anomalies.

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.062 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, absolutely.

00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:52.233 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And, you know, I don't
know why would they do that.

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.734 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, it's
definitely possible.

00:19:53.734 --> 00:19:56.821 align:middle line:84%
They have all the sexual
organs to procreate.

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're fully function.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:00.783 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're fully
functional beings.

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:03.369 align:middle line:84%
The question is, in
a project, if they

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:04.995 align:middle line:84%
were to do that,
they were probably

00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:08.082 align:middle line:84%
trying to make some
super race or being.

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
reason to do that.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.001 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
imagine what Hitler

00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:13.254 align:middle line:84%
would have done
with this technology

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.589 align:middle line:90%
if he had perfected it?

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:17.508 align:middle line:90%
He would abused it.

00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:19.135 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, that's
a scary thought.

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:19.927 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really.

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:22.012 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, so how
do we know ETs aren't

00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:24.181 align:middle line:90%
doing the same kind of abuse?

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, Germany
had a lot of experience

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.437 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:33.941 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I do believe
that they met with them.

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:39.321 align:middle line:84%
And I know Hitler probably knew
about some of these things.

00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:42.241 align:middle line:84%
But they had to
keep it a secret.

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.701 align:middle line:84%
And they were not
allowed to use it

00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:48.581 align:middle line:84%
in war was the deal from what
I heard through second hand

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:50.124 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:53.669 align:middle line:84%
So that was a very
interesting thing

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:56.255 align:middle line:84%
to realize that he had
technology and did not

00:20:56.255 --> 00:21:01.594 align:middle line:84%
use it against us in
war and against Europe.

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:06.348 align:middle line:84%
But who's not to say he
did not use it on himself?

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:11.145 align:middle line:84%
And on his closer
confidants around him?

00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:12.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's cloned somewhere.

00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:15.733 align:middle line:90%
That's just what we need, right?

00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:18.569 align:middle line:84%
And some of these people
want to live forever.

00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:20.488 align:middle line:84%
You know, these
multi-billionaires,

00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:23.449 align:middle line:84%
if they have the ability to do
what we talked about earlier--

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:27.244 align:middle line:84%
download memory, download
memory into cloned bodies.

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:29.622 align:middle line:84%
They get a brand new
body every 20 years.

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:32.791 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, and imagine if
they had the hair strand from

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:35.961 align:middle line:90%
Marilyn Monroe or--

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:37.713 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or anybody
or John Kennedy.

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:39.465 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Or anyone, right.

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:43.928 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can easily
reproduce a clone just

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:46.305 align:middle line:84%
from that genetic-- just from
that small amount of DNA.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.724 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a
scientific background.

00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:51.936 align:middle line:84%
Have you been involved
in any cloning practices?

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.979 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I have not
directly, only indirectly

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:57.608 align:middle line:90%
been part of these projects.

00:21:57.608 --> 00:22:02.071 align:middle line:84%
And I'm only aware of it
because I was in the same area

00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:07.993 align:middle line:84%
where they were cloning plants,
animals, extraterrestrials,

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:90%
and mixing these things.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.667 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until later on I found
out through my secondary people

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:19.713 align:middle line:84%
and also through the
special library, I call it,

00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:23.467 align:middle line:84%
of learning how they
do it and that they're

00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:24.718 align:middle line:90%
very successful with it.

00:22:24.718 --> 00:22:26.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I still
don't understand

00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:29.723 align:middle line:84%
the reason for cloning I
mean, outside of the organs

00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:30.808 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:34.937 align:middle line:84%
But you're killing a body,
a human, to take his liver,

00:22:34.937 --> 00:22:37.773 align:middle line:84%
to take his kidneys,
to take his heart.

00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:39.608 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with that.

00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:40.901 align:middle line:90%
I think that's horrible.

00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a
bigger picture here.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.613 align:middle line:90%
What am I missing?

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:47.032 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think
they are, you know,

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:53.038 align:middle line:84%
diabolically trying to create
some sort of army or something.

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget, they
can clone all sorts

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:59.003 align:middle line:84%
of weird scary things,
not just humans,

00:22:59.003 --> 00:23:02.047 align:middle line:84%
and to use that against
us in some sort of control

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:04.258 align:middle line:90%
method or control fashion.

00:23:04.258 --> 00:23:06.427 align:middle line:84%
And not to talk like
a conspiracy theorist,

00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:84%
my opinion is I cannot,
like you cannot,

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:10.681 align:middle line:90%
figure out any other agenda.

00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:12.391 align:middle line:84%
You know, why would
they want to replace--

00:23:15.936 --> 00:23:22.776 align:middle line:84%
release 100,000 clones into the
general public to create what?

00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's an
agenda somewhere.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.446 align:middle line:90%
There's a hidden agenda--

00:23:25.446 --> 00:23:26.322 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's
something going on--

00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:27.573 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To do something.

00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:28.949 align:middle line:84%
You know, maybe
they're all going

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:31.535 align:middle line:84%
to be like Manchurian
candidates.

00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:34.121 align:middle line:84%
So at any given point,
they can hit a button

00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:36.332 align:middle line:84%
and they all do everything
that you want them to do.

00:23:36.332 --> 00:23:37.166 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:42.838 align:middle line:84%
They use cloning too
in exercises as well.

00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:43.922 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you mean?

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:46.467 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they have
huge underground facilities

00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:52.181 align:middle line:84%
in cities that mimic different
types of cities and countries

00:23:52.181 --> 00:23:53.599 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:58.354 align:middle line:84%
And they use cloning
type people that

00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:02.191 align:middle line:84%
are implanted with memories
to test biological warfare

00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:07.112 align:middle line:84%
systems, to test weapons of
different types of scalar

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.572 align:middle line:90%
frequency weapons.

00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they can survive
some kind of catastrophe.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.034 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:15.788 align:middle line:84%
So it's also to see how
the public would respond

00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:19.875 align:middle line:84%
to a catastrophe in
one area we'll say,

00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:22.044 align:middle line:90%
let's say Washington DC.

00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll have a mock
setup better than Hollywood.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:31.053 align:middle line:84%
And people would basically
just wake up on a bench

00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:34.348 align:middle line:84%
or wake up in their
home and already knowing

00:24:34.348 --> 00:24:37.184 align:middle line:84%
that they have to
go to work today

00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:40.729 align:middle line:90%
or they have a premeditated--

00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:43.357 align:middle line:84%
they really believe
that they maybe just

00:24:43.357 --> 00:24:44.858 align:middle line:90%
fell asleep reading the paper.

00:24:44.858 --> 00:24:44.942 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:44.942 --> 00:24:45.776 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:48.612 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then a catastrophe
happens of some sort

00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:84%
or an outbreak, a viral
outbreak, let's say.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they want to
see how the people react.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:58.414 align:middle line:84%
And also, they
want to record this

00:24:58.414 --> 00:25:00.708 align:middle line:84%
because they will
sell this information

00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:05.879 align:middle line:84%
to other corporations,
these terrible weapons,

00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:07.423 align:middle line:90%
and say, look at what we can do.

00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:90%
We did a mockup.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.758 align:middle line:90%
And this is what happened.

00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:14.054 align:middle line:84%
So we'll sell it to this country
and turn around and sell it

00:25:14.054 --> 00:25:17.558 align:middle line:90%
to this terrorist group.

00:25:17.558 --> 00:25:20.602 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen these places.

00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:24.314 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think these
clones, Emery, have already

00:25:24.314 --> 00:25:26.525 align:middle line:90%
been put into society?

00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:28.485 align:middle line:84%
They've been mixed
in with us already?

00:25:28.485 --> 00:25:30.863 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I 100% believe
definitely there's clones

00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:84%
walking around that do not know
they're clones and that are put

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:42.249 align:middle line:84%
into positions that
for whatever agenda--

00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what happened
to that actual human

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.004 align:middle line:90%
that the clone has replaced?

00:25:47.004 --> 00:25:48.839 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, if they're
replacing someone,

00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:52.718 align:middle line:84%
well it's usually probably that
person is terminated or maybe

00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:55.679 align:middle line:90%
that person is going to have--

00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:57.014 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little disappearance.

00:25:57.014 --> 00:25:59.141 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, a little
disappearance or something.

00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:02.644 align:middle line:84%
But there's also clones that
are just wandering around,

00:26:02.644 --> 00:26:05.063 align:middle line:84%
that are working
individuals that--

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So there could be--

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:07.191 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Did not
have an agenda--

00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:08.776 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There
could be two of me.

00:26:08.776 --> 00:26:11.361 align:middle line:90%
Me and the clone somewhere.

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:13.155 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they put him in
England or something.

00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:13.822 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:14.656 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:15.783 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But who's they?

00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:19.077 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I always fall
back on the only one that

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:20.579 align:middle line:84%
has the power and
the money to do

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:26.877 align:middle line:84%
this are these really
megalethargic corporations,

00:26:26.877 --> 00:26:29.505 align:middle line:84%
you know, like these
top 10 corporations

00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:32.758 align:middle line:84%
from around the planet
that get all the goodies.

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:36.470 align:middle line:84%
They have the best technology
because they get everything

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.596 align:middle line:90%
from the extraterrestrials.

00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:38.972 align:middle line:90%
They always get it first.

00:26:38.972 --> 00:26:39.807 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:26:39.807 --> 00:26:44.603 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And whether they put
to good use, it's very rare.

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:48.607 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of-- all of our
advancements in technology

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:50.526 align:middle line:90%
comes from these corporations.

00:26:50.526 --> 00:26:52.903 align:middle line:84%
So I look at it
in a positive way

00:26:52.903 --> 00:26:57.115 align:middle line:84%
as well, because a lot of the
stuff we use in surgery to save

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:58.033 align:middle line:90%
people's lives--

00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:00.118 align:middle line:84%
you know, we use
them in firetrucks.

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:04.122 align:middle line:84%
We use them in the police
departments and things

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:05.791 align:middle line:90%
that prolong our life.

00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:06.625 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:09.503 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the clones, Emery,
have their own personality?

00:27:09.503 --> 00:27:11.672 align:middle line:90%
I mean do they act on their own?

00:27:11.672 --> 00:27:12.464 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:27:12.464 --> 00:27:15.509 align:middle line:84%
Depending on what the
agenda is for that clone

00:27:15.509 --> 00:27:19.638 align:middle line:84%
or why that clone was made
or how that clone was raised,

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:21.098 align:middle line:84%
the clone could
have been implanted

00:27:21.098 --> 00:27:25.561 align:middle line:84%
into a family when he was
three and just kind of raised

00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:26.478 align:middle line:90%
into a normal life.

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:27.938 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he grew
up like a human being.

00:27:27.938 --> 00:27:29.398 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Grew up
like a human being

00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:31.775 align:middle line:84%
and guided into a
certain position,

00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, in a government
to do something

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.157 align:middle line:84%
and then later on maybe
was told that they

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:41.159 align:middle line:90%
are a clone or maybe not.

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:45.122 align:middle line:84%
So everyone can have
their own personality.

00:27:45.122 --> 00:27:47.457 align:middle line:90%
But not everyone is.

00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:51.503 align:middle line:84%
And some clones, like I told
you, can be mind controlled.

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:54.214 align:middle line:84%
They could be placed
into the family

00:27:54.214 --> 00:27:58.385 align:middle line:84%
and then later on activated,
like the Manchurian Candidate

00:27:58.385 --> 00:27:59.678 align:middle line:90%
kind of situation.

00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:00.762 align:middle line:90%
And then all of a sudden--

00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:01.179 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To do something.

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:02.556 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This
person just flipped

00:28:02.556 --> 00:28:04.766 align:middle line:84%
for no reason, killed
a bunch of people,

00:28:04.766 --> 00:28:07.811 align:middle line:84%
has no idea why they
did it, but they did it.

00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:08.896 align:middle line:90%
And now they're in jail--

00:28:08.896 --> 00:28:09.354 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:11.607 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And a lot of
these things are like this.

00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:14.067 align:middle line:84%
Wars are started
over because they

00:28:14.067 --> 00:28:18.405 align:middle line:84%
think someone stole
something from them

00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:22.159 align:middle line:84%
or did something to their
family member or, you know--

00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:25.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some are calling
for that Chinese cloner

00:28:25.078 --> 00:28:26.455 align:middle line:90%
to be arrested.

00:28:26.455 --> 00:28:27.414 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:29.249 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I'm
not here to judge.

00:28:29.249 --> 00:28:32.753 align:middle line:90%
I can just tell you my opinion.

00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:34.421 align:middle line:84%
I think it needs
to be revisited.

00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:37.841 align:middle line:84%
And I think more
scientists and universities

00:28:37.841 --> 00:28:39.259 align:middle line:90%
need to get involved.

00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:41.929 align:middle line:84%
And the United Nations
needs to get involved.

00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:44.598 align:middle line:90%
And let's say what's ethically--

00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:48.477 align:middle line:84%
you know, what's the right
ethically thing to do for this?

00:28:48.477 --> 00:28:51.438 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
start going rogue,

00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:54.316 align:middle line:84%
this is where things
can get out of hand.

00:28:54.316 --> 00:28:56.985 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
prove to the people

00:28:56.985 --> 00:29:01.823 align:middle line:84%
of the planet and the leaders
why is this a positive thing

00:29:01.823 --> 00:29:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and what does it serve
the general population.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.078 align:middle line:84%
That's why I always
tell everyone,

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:07.663 align:middle line:84%
you know, when
people were asking me

00:29:07.663 --> 00:29:11.416 align:middle line:84%
questions about all sorts
of personality things,

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:84%
it's like, well, how is that
going to serve everyone else?

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.714 align:middle line:84%
How is that going
to serve the planet?

00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:22.052 align:middle line:84%
Are we cloning humpback
whales because we need to,

00:29:22.052 --> 00:29:26.390 align:middle line:84%
at a later date, be able to
grow them because there's not

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.183 align:middle line:90%
going to be any left.

00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:32.187 align:middle line:84%
As far as humans are concerned,
that's a very delicate thing,

00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:34.439 align:middle line:90%
because what about the spirit?

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:36.525 align:middle line:90%
What about the soul?

00:29:36.525 --> 00:29:40.862 align:middle line:84%
What about-- are you growing
this person in stasis

00:29:40.862 --> 00:29:42.781 align:middle line:84%
until they're a
certain age and not

00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:45.993 align:middle line:84%
waking them up and
keeping them in a coma

00:29:45.993 --> 00:29:48.370 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't
really have a life?

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.499 align:middle line:84%
Are you grow-- are you growing
this clone without a brain?

00:29:52.499 --> 00:29:57.796 align:middle line:84%
Are you just utilizing the
scaffolding of a tissue?

00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:00.090 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
questions to be answered,

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:04.386 align:middle line:84%
that the general public and
the leaders of the world

00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:08.515 align:middle line:84%
need to look at this
person and maybe guide it

00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:10.100 align:middle line:90%
into a different direction.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.728 align:middle line:84%
We need to really
wait for the science

00:30:12.728 --> 00:30:16.523 align:middle line:84%
to come forward and think
about what's ethical

00:30:16.523 --> 00:30:20.861 align:middle line:84%
