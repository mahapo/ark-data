00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.200 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
Cosmic Disclosure.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
and I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back to the show.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, Dave.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: When you first
encountered a partial body--

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:84%
by that point, you said you
had seen some arms or hands.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Had you seen other
limbs besides--

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: --arms or hands?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, yes.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.366 align:middle line:10%
I saw pieces of like,
the face, pieces--

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: Oh, really?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: --of skin,
maybe small fingers.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.390 align:middle line:84%
It looked like some sort
of appendages, some like,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:84%
phalanges, maybe toes, feet,
parts of like, legs, very

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
small parts though,
cross-section parts,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:84%
that were cut in a way that
you would have to have a very

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:84%
special instrument
to, you know, transect

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
these particles
of these tissues.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:84%
The tissue particles
I got were always

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.820 align:middle line:90%
cut in very specific ways.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So, when we got these tissues,
we'd just, you know, of course,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:84%
start right into,
you know, we always

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:84%
had a job what we were going to
do with this piece of tissue.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And then later came full
bodies and torsos, maybe

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:84%
with or without a head, or
a full arm, or other things,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:90%
even genitalia.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:90%
All sorts of different things.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Now, did you have any
particularly different surgical

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.790 align:middle line:90%
equipment?

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Like did you use
a normal scalpel,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.060 align:middle line:84%
or was there something
unusual about that?

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, there was
normal surgical equipment that

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:84%
we'd normally use, but there
was also other devices they had

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that were more advanced than the
stuff that we had at that time.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
There were more
high-powered lasers

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and electrocautery devices that
we'd normally use in surgery,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:84%
but on a different level,
using different types,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:90%
I think, of frequencies.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:84%
There was one, also, it
was like a sonic knife.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And later on, that knife did
come out to the civilian usage

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:90%
later on.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.601 align:middle line:84%
But I was not familiar with
that in modern civilian usage.

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
civilian, also I mean

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:84%
military, just normal
military hostels

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
we're not using harmonic
scalpels at that point.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And my first use of
a harmonic scalpel

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.767 align:middle line:90%
was actually in that program.

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: All right.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you a question
that we might think is dumb,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:84%
but some people will
take very seriously.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Sure.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: You're
handling exobiology.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.786 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And there's a lot
of people out there that think

00:02:39.786 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:84%
that there are shapeshifting
biological beings that can

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.860 align:middle line:84%
instantly morph from
one form to another.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Some people have said that they
think the world's elite are

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:90%
shapeshifting reptilians.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.048 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: That's right.

00:02:51.048 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Did you encounter
any shapeshifting biological

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:90%
matter?

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I think I did.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
These trans-dimensional beings,
when they get to that level,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:84%
they are actually a level of
consciousness that's beyond--

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:90%
like billions of years from now.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.905 align:middle line:84%
They get to that
light body form.

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And you can be
whatever you want,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and go to any dimension to
help out and do whatever.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that one of them
died here in a 3-D shape that--

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.500 align:middle line:84%
how we found him was kind
of like a translucent blob,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:90%
like a jellyfish but longer.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think, since it
had light within it,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I think it might have
been one of these very

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
higher-dimensional
beings that was, maybe,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:90%
in the mode of shifting.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they had
some way of capturing

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:90%
this type of energetic form.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, somehow
encapsulating it,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:90%
and then bringing it in.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It did give off light,
but it didn't give off

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:84%
any type of frequency
that we could pick up.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, it was
approximately like an oval?

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Like a human-type of shape, but
just in a very general sense.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, it kind of
looked like a cookie cutter--

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:84%
like you make those cookie
cutter doughboys at Christmas.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But very bulbous, and
round, and very liquidy.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: How tall was it?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It was-- the one I
was on was about six feet tall.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:84%
But did it have any
differentiated features

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
that you could identify
with the autopsy?

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: That was the problem.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Those pieces of
equipment they gave

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
me to utilize to
take the specimens

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:84%
did not work, because
the tissue was fluid.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So, we were just using syringes,
basic syringes, and needles,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:90%
and special suction devices.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And we were sucking
just very small amounts

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.772 align:middle line:90%
of different parts of the body.

00:04:40.772 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
where this being--

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:84%
that was my own
conclusion, by the way --I

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.590 align:middle line:84%
don't know where this being came
from, or how it even got there.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Later on, I learned more
about extraterrestrials,

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.654 align:middle line:84%
and that's how I put
two and two together.

00:04:53.654 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course of, you know,
trans-dimensional travel

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials, and
how they do it, and so forth.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, I would assume
this had some sort of thicker

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.092 align:middle line:90%
membrane to hold the fluid in.

00:05:03.092 --> 00:05:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, it did.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:90%
I was about a centimeter thick.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And it reminded me of
a very thick Jell-O.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you cut it,
it had a glow to it.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:90%
When you cut it.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Inside?

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, kind of like
a cyalume light stick glow.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.231 align:middle line:90%
And then it would just go away.

00:05:21.231 --> 00:05:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when they
said, no more cutting.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Start using needles and suction,
very, very sharp suction

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
devices we have that
are very, very small.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Like 30-gauge suction devices,
like 30-gauge-needle-type

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:90%
suction devices.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And we were taking
very small amounts

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.179 align:middle line:90%
of different parts of the body.

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What would you see
the viscosity liquid was inside?

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Was it like water, or was it
more like a thick syrup, or--

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, it was
like a clear maple syrup.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And there was parts
inside that you

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
could see that were giving
off light, pink and purple

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:90%
and yellow.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But it looked like
they had shapes.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a
translucent being,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:84%
but it's like you're looking
into a clear Jell-O. So,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.960 align:middle line:90%
it's distorted what that was.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.450 align:middle line:84%
But they would not let us take
any samples of the colored

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:90%
liquid.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Maybe
someone else did,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:84%
because it was so
compartmentalized.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.570 align:middle line:90%
A lot of beings--

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different technicians
had different things they did.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't that
advanced at that time.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.834 align:middle line:90%
So, I did very simple things.

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I think probably
one of the hardest things

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:84%
for people watching this is
going to be, come on, man.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:84%
You didn't try to ask
anybody a question about what

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.670 align:middle line:84%
these things are,
where they came from?

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No, no.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I signed a very big
briefing document.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what I was
kind of getting into.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going to be
actually doing just cadaver

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.320 align:middle line:90%
work on soldiers.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.540 align:middle line:84%
When I got in there,
it started escalating.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I knew
how serious it was.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have also
heard of stories,

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
whether they were
true or not, of people

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.001 align:middle line:90%
talking after hours and things.

00:07:00.001 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, they'd go
missing really quickly.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So, it was a very high turnover
rate for technicians there,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
for clinical specialists that
were doing this type of work.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:84%
So, I was really good at
keeping secrets, and keeping

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:90%
my mouth shut.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.030 align:middle line:90%
And it got me really far.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was frustrating
to a point.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.690 align:middle line:84%
But I was so intrigued,
and it was so--

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I was just so
enthralled with it.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I actually kind of got
obsessed with going to work,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to know
more and more and more.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.222 align:middle line:84%
Because I was coming up
with my own conclusions.

00:07:29.222 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
started studying it

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:84%
on my own, which,
there was really

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:84%
nothing out there at that time
for that kind of extreme--

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Did they you
monitor your usage?

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Like library card, or internet--

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Everything that I
had was completely under full

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:90%
surveillance, 24/7.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.130 align:middle line:90%
That was part of the deal, too.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And anyone that was with
me would always be--

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.270 align:middle line:84%
not, they wouldn't tell
them, but anyone, my friends

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.070 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So, it was hard to have friends
and relationships, even up

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to this day it's
very hard for me

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
to have anyone close to me,
because I'm afraid something

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:84%
would happen to them, because I
basically lost everyone so far.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: That's right.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And very soon after
you lost all your stuff

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.472 align:middle line:84%
is when the brakes
went out on my car.

00:08:12.472 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: That's right.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: So.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I remember that.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: All right.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
think we should cover here

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.109 align:middle line:84%
is the awesome size
of the facility

00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:90%
that you were working in.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:10%
Because we kind of got into that
with the colored lines before.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.753 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, right.

00:08:26.753 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: But if you personally
are saying that you--

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:84%
well again, tell us how many
different unique species

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.830 align:middle line:90%
did you appear to have seen?

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well,
I'll say specimens,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:84%
because I count my
specimens as a species.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was a real
extraterrestrial,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.287 align:middle line:84%
or it was something
grown in a lab,

00:08:49.287 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:84%
or if it was just a
disinformation piece of tissue

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
they would throw out
every now and then

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to technicians,
which is very common,

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:84%
in case something happens,
so you won't be credible.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.516 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say a
little bit over 3,000.

00:09:02.516 --> 00:09:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget,
you could do up

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.680 align:middle line:84%
to 10 to 20
examinations in one day

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:84%
if you're just doing
very small harvesting

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.510 align:middle line:84%
biopsies of small tissue,
just for DNA alone.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you might have
one that would last you

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:84%
a week of analyzing,
and collecting

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:28.300 align:middle line:84%
specimens, and giving reports
know to specific individuals.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes there would
be more than one person

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.516 align:middle line:84%
that would come in and observe
you, and say no, do this or do

00:09:36.516 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:84%
that, instead of using
the speaker phone head

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:90%
system for some reason.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What would be the
first thing that you would see

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:90%
when you pick up your folder?

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It basically had basic
stuff on it, like time, date,

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:84%
your room, you know, a red 12,
what they want you to exactly

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.870 align:middle line:90%
transect.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, just
pull out the nerve,

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
just pull out the muscle, just
take this amount of tissue,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.090 align:middle line:84%
just draw up this amount
of cc of this liquid

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:90%
from this part of the body.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
It was very definitive
of exactly what you

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
were going to do, and time
was-- they were really big

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.400 align:middle line:90%
on time and performance.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So, you would go in
there, and you would not

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:84%
know what your second
one would be on that pad.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:21.036 align:middle line:84%
So, you wouldn't know until
you completed your first one.

00:10:21.036 --> 00:10:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, you might
only have, let's say,

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:26.072 align:middle line:84%
60 minutes to work
on one cadaver?

00:10:26.072 --> 00:10:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They
don't give you time.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:90%
You do what you do.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But the faster that you do these
things, and the more proficient

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.370 align:middle line:84%
that you're at it, they like
you-- you know, of course,

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving more samples
than anyone else.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So, and I was used to
harvesting human tissue anyway,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:84%
with harvest
transplants and stuff.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So, it was very easy for me
to fall into this category

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:90%
and do these procedures.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Did they tell you what
surgical instruments to use?

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Did they have that
much of a protocol,

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:90%
or did you have some freedom.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I pretty
much have access to anything.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:84%
There was a few times I went
on the intercom and said,

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:90%
you know, hey, I need this.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I need a number 11 blade, or
I need a rongeur of this size.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:90%
It depends what it was.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
But most everything
is in that room,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:84%
that you could
get from the wall.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And if not, they
would put it through,

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and you would get it,
like, immediately.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Within a couple of minutes.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: In the late 1990s,
this alleged alien autopsy film

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.790 align:middle line:90%
came out.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:90%
The Santilli autopsy film.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.430 align:middle line:90%
I assume you've seen that.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I've heard about it.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I didn't follow much up on it.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I remember at the time,
I did review it, yeah.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Now one of the weird
things about that film is that

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.159 align:middle line:84%
and there's debate to
this day, and mythology

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
as to whether it's
real or whether it

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:84%
was a very skillful fraud
--but one of the weird things

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.750 align:middle line:84%
is that they peel this
black thing off the eye,

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.709 align:middle line:84%
and then the eyes
are like looking up

00:11:52.709 --> 00:11:53.750 align:middle line:90%
into the head underneath.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Absolutely.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the extraterrestrials
that I've actually seen,

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
their skulls and heads and
stuff always had film over them.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Unless it was already
taken off by somebody else.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And it wasn't always
black and green like you hear

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:90%
in the stories.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:84%
It could be many
different colors.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.200 align:middle line:90%
I've seen violet.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:90%
I've seen pink.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I've seen-- but that
film is always there.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:84%
There's always some sort of
film or cap over the eye.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of like
conforms to the exact--

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:84%
whatever eye shape
it is, whether you

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:84%
have a diamond eye,
or a trapezoidal eye,

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.030 align:middle line:84%
or a hexagon eye,
or a round eye.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:84%
They're not always
round, by the way.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's just right over there.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not sure.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I always thought that's how we
reverse-engineered night vision

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and infrared, is through
the reverse engineering

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.480 align:middle line:84%
of these ETs that they found,
way back when, in the Navy.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And I remember hearing some
generals talk about how

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:84%
they took these films off,
and those were light-gathering

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and also light-suppressing
films that were

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.627 align:middle line:90%
not biological, by the way.

00:13:06.627 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Was there like a
Google Glass component to it,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.590 align:middle line:84%
like a heads-up display with
information that you see?

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that most of these
beings, if they were here,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:84%
they have already
telepathic-- everything

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:84%
is projected into their
consciousness and brain.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm pretty certain they
wouldn't have any cool helmets,

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.680 align:middle line:84%
or chairs, or anything
like that they sit down.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.314 align:middle line:84%
When I see these craft
people show on TV.

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:84%
On a couple of shows
I saw they're like,

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:84%
showing these cockpits,
and all these buttons.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, wow,
they have no idea.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Did you find evidence
of beings with hardware,

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
technology hardware
in their bodies.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:90%
And what types of hardware?

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, not
just even hardware,

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:84%
but also on the outside of the
bodies, which is really neat,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.720 align:middle line:84%
things that come out of their
head to their mouth and nose,

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.030 align:middle line:90%
from the back of the head.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:90%
I found many types of--

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:84%
which would show up on X-ray
--cylinders inside the body.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But I was never allowed to
take one out or to touch it.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it was used for.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.800 align:middle line:84%
But they were
always cylindrical,

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.990 align:middle line:84%
like capsules, like that
you take with vitamins.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Like that kind of size.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:90%
And they could be many--

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no, that shape,
but many different sizes.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes in many
different places of the body.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if that
was put in there by us,

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.990 align:middle line:84%
or that's just something
that they use for their--

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.890 align:middle line:84%
to help communicate
with us or something.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:84%
I had a feeling that it
was more of an adapting

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.780 align:middle line:84%
process for the body to maybe
survive in this atmosphere.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.442 align:middle line:84%
And it could have been a field,
too, to protect the body.

00:14:52.442 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:84%
There's many
extraterrestrials that

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:90%
have fields around the body.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
You can't-- it's very
thin, and it's very small.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:90%
But it's so thin.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.504 align:middle line:90%
It's microscopic.

00:15:02.504 --> 00:15:04.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's there, and it
protects the whole body

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:90%
from this atmosphere.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think these
other devices that we

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
see coming out of
the ears or the head,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:84%
that come around over the
mouth and nose, probably

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:84%
has to do with atmospheric
breathing and communication.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:90%
My belief, anyway.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: The reason why I ask
that is that you described them

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:84%
seeming to be downloaded
with information.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:84%
You said that they wouldn't
need a heads-up display

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:84%
on these little things
that cover their eyes.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So, is that some sort of
wet-wired technological

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.832 align:middle line:84%
interface with
their consciousness?

00:15:40.832 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, I think a lot
of them have advanced to this

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-assisted
technology that they either

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:84%
implanted into themselves, or,
just because of them growing

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:84%
over millions of years and
forming into these amazing

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:84%
beings, have developed ways and
sciences that we cannot even

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:90%
understand or comprehend.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we wouldn't
understand the science,

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:84%
because the science
doesn't exist yet.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
It would all be there
already inside the being.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
beings that have obviously

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:84%
traveled billions
of light years,

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
or thousands of light
years, to get here.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So, they have mastered this
travel across the universe.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And maybe even
trans-dimensionally.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So, it would only be well-suited
to believe or think that,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and that's just my
hypothesis, by the way,

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:84%
that they would have
this technology already

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.150 align:middle line:90%
ensued in them.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: If we have this wet
wire interface, could there be,

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:45.600 align:middle line:84%
in certain cases, a sort of
booby trap effect where that

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.639 align:middle line:84%
would self-destruct the body so
that it couldn't be identified?

00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
was ever happening?

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: What I do believe in,
what I have heard secondhand

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:01.230 align:middle line:84%
from being in the projects, is
a lot of these beings that came

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.260 align:middle line:84%
to the planet were actually
clones of their own--

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:84%
the 3-D ones that were
actually maybe captured

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:84%
--were actually
clones of their own.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:84%
They were like programmed
life form beings.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So, they clone them,
they program them--

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.035 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: They clone themselves?

00:17:13.035 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:90%
They clone themselves.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll clone a
similar being from them.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And they'll-- Programmed
Life Form, we call them PLFs.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:90%
And these PLFs are--

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
they're half cybernetic
and they're half organic.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And so, they can move
very fluid, like a person.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.680 align:middle line:90%
You would not even know.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And when they crash or whatever,
sometimes ETs actually want

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.470 align:middle line:84%
to crash their vehicles
here to help upgrade us,

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.180 align:middle line:84%
so they can
reverse-engineer the stuff.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And the bodies they
find are actually

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:84%
just these PLFs that
maybe last a week

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:84%
or up to a year
with no sustenance.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.911 align:middle line:84%
But they found that
out the hard way.

00:17:55.911 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:84%
When they were capturing
these, and most of them

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
were dead when they crashed,
and they were putting them

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
in alcohol or formaldehyde, and
the body would instantly just

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.680 align:middle line:90%
dissolve.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not like something
we would catch here, and put

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:84%
in our lab, an animal,
or a human hand,

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:84%
or a brain or something that
has a very strong tissue--

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.360 align:middle line:90%
collagen structure.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It was made up of
synthetic structure.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So, they started using
saline and special types

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.255 align:middle line:90%
of water and plasmas.

00:18:26.255 --> 00:18:28.380 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: On the 50-year
anniversary of the Roswell

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:10%
crash, in 1997, Colonel Philip
Corso came out with the book

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.840 align:middle line:10%
"The Day After Roswell."

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:10%
And one of the testimonies
that he had in that book

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:10%
was that the original
Roswell beings--

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:10%
our government
was very confused,

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:10%
because they
basically had, like,

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:10%
a tube that went from the
esophagus to the anus.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.820 align:middle line:90%
And there was really no--

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Exactly.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: --digestive system.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.028 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, how does that
relate to this PLF thing?

00:18:53.028 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: That's exactly
what a PLF would look like.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
The design of that, and I
have worked on clones and PLFs

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.870 align:middle line:84%
There is no digestive
track or anything,

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
but they're somehow able to have
an electrical charge in them,

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
that is sustained
for a while, that

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.020 align:middle line:84%
helps the muscles,
and their bodies,

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and also transmit data
to whoever sent them.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:90%
And they don't need--

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know
what that tube is for,

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:84%
but I know exactly what
he was talking about,

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.200 align:middle line:90%
because we've seen these tubes.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.290 align:middle line:10%
And maybe they have something
that they have to take,

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:10%
because we've seen multiple
tubes that go off of this tube,

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:10%
like a tree--

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: --branch.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't go anywhere.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It just goes into
this spongy tissue,

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:84%
which is made up of muscle,
and just tendons and stuff.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:43.815 align:middle line:84%
And also incorporated with that
is a type of metal, and other--

00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
not an exoskeleton,
but an inner skeleton

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:84%
that keeps these beings, I
guess, alive for the mission.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think each
one of those are

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.655 align:middle line:84%
made for every different
mission they have,

00:19:54.655 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:84%
whether it's crashing into the
ocean and giving us some stuff,

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:90%
or carrying out--

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
collecting lavender in
a field or something.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: The material,
genetically, that makes a PLF,

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:90%
is that grown?

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:10%
Or does it have to be actually
taken from another being?

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.634 align:middle line:84%
How do you get the material,
the biological material?

00:20:14.634 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Unlike here, where
we grow stuff on Earth,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:84%
like beings and
clones and hybrids,

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials actually
formed this through harmonics

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:90%
and frequency and sound.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So, they can make anything,
cells, or synthetic cells--

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:84%
which I'm pretty certain
they're synthetic,

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:84%
through some of the stuff
that I've collected.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I've never got
to see an actual synthetic cell

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
under a microscope, or
an electron microscope.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:84%
But just from debriefings
I have been on

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and things that I've seen
with my physical eyes,

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I can tell the tissue
was not real tissue,

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.230 align:middle line:90%
but it was operational tissue.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Just like today, they have
pieces of synthetic things

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:84%
they can put in your
body to replace a tendon

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:07.300 align:middle line:90%
or help strengthen a vessel.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, we put
vessels in all the time.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.708 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Just to
be clear, though,

00:21:10.708 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:84%
if you're saying it's
a synthetic cell,

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
it would still have amino acids
and proteins consistent with

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.210 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:19.495 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:21:19.495 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: It's not like
it's made out of plastic.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.135 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, that's
what I'm saying.

00:21:22.135 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a hybrid of
synthetic and real organisms.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:90%
But it's not one or the other.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Because from what-- this is
secondhand --what I heard,

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.680 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't have
mitochondria in them,

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't have DNA.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But the cell did operate the
way it was supposed to operate.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Weird.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.359 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, very weird.

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: If there's
no mitochondria,

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.560 align:middle line:90%
how does it have energy?

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, good question.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:84%
That's science that I
wouldn't even know about yet.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: But that is
something that's asked.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Do they--
can they culture, like,

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.075 align:middle line:84%
a small sample of tissue,
and then make a lot more,

00:22:00.075 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and then use that to
grow on of these--

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I believe, personally,
that's what they're trying

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.030 align:middle line:90%
to do with all these samples.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't in on that.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:90%
I do not know.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:11.240 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that-- of course,
most of the samples are not

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.330 align:middle line:90%
just tested, of course.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:84%
They are trying to
learn how to hybridize

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:84%
these cells with human
cells, and trying

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:84%
to grow things in the lab by
mixing these cells together,

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.590 align:middle line:90%
is what they're trying to do.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't find that out
till way later down the road,

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.880 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:29.030 align:middle line:90%
So, that I do know.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: If there are
synthetic aspects to the cell,

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:84%
what would be something
that we might identify?

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Would we find molecules?

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.235 align:middle line:90%
Would we find alloys?

00:22:41.235 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Is there metals in the cell?

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:84%
What kind of things
might be unusual?

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, the unusual
things that I've heard after

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.920 align:middle line:84%
this-- and this is not
me seeing the cell.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.359 align:middle line:84%
Just so you know, I've seen
briefings on my folder.

00:22:56.359 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I went through many
things where they

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.890 align:middle line:90%
had pictures of these cells.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:90%
But I did not see this.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I did not personally
see the cell.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:90%
They had many different shapes.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.595 align:middle line:84%
And they had-- a
lot of them were

00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
geometric, which is
weird, because that

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.830 align:middle line:90%
means it's a lattice.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- like, cells
are spheres, most of them.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they're a concave
disk, like a red blood cell,

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.580 align:middle line:90%
which is a very unique design.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But these cells were
more of a lattice.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So, they formed shapes, and they
formed honeycombs and different

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:33.480 align:middle line:84%
things, and they definitely had
an electrical output to them.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And where that came
from, I don't know.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So, they kind of ran off,
I think, the own field

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.490 align:middle line:84%
of the energy of the Earth
for a certain amount of time.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that tube was used
to put certain elements in

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
to help with the electrical
part of the body.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Because those were
all temporary.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:90%
The ones that were found here.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure they have
ones that last a lifetime.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I'm trying to help
the skeptics along here,

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:90%
just in terms of--

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.690 align:middle line:84%
a healthy skeptic,
I think, would ask

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:90%
healthy skeptical questions.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: We seem to
view biological material,

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:84%
clone material, as being
rare, valuable, hard to make.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking about beings
that are like plastic bags.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:90%
Like--

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: --one week
and they're done.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: On no.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, how could
these genetic materials be

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:32.185 align:middle line:84%
so abundant that they
would be that disposable?

00:24:32.185 --> 00:24:33.310 align:middle line:90%
I guess I'm having a hard--

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.393 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, that's easy.

00:24:34.393 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, number one, these
beings, I'm telling you,

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:84%
they can make
anything they want.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.240 align:middle line:90%
They don't need our gold.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.610 align:middle line:84%
They don't need our
sperm or our eggs.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's something
they could do on their own.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:90%
They don't need to come here.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.150 align:middle line:84%
If anything, they're
trying to preserve us.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.380 align:middle line:90%
But they don't need--

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to preserve
this DNA at this time, maybe.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But getting back
to your question,

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:84%
is that right now, even
in our projects, right now

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:84%
we have the ability to 3-D
print any organ in your body

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:90%
that you need.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:90%
A lung, no problem.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:90%
A heart, no problem.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
With your DNA, using your
cells from the tissue

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.740 align:middle line:84%
from the broken or dead
organ, or from another part

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Because enfolded in
the DNA is actually every part

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.735 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

00:25:30.735 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right, of course.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And that's
what's so cool.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you open the DNA
up, I can say, oh, here's

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Dave's heart.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Put it in the computer,
and now the printer

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.686 align:middle line:90%
will print your heart.

00:25:39.686 --> 00:25:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And now we can do a heart
transplant with your own heart,

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.875 align:middle line:84%
but we'll give you one a little
bit younger and stronger.

00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:90%
And will juice it up.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.999 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: I want to toss in
something that my insider,

00:25:47.999 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:10%
Jacob, said to me once, which
was that we are currently

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:10%
believing that neurological
tissue cannot be regrown.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And yet he had
reports of people who

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:04.490 align:middle line:84%
had been through catastrophic
spinal cord injuries.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And that, even if the
nerve fibers had completely

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
gone dead, and rotted, and
been reabsorbed by the body,

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.220 align:middle line:84%
that they could put this thing
at the base of the spinal cord

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.529 align:middle line:84%
in the neck, and that the
nerves would just grow back

00:26:19.529 --> 00:26:22.070 align:middle line:84%
into the body, and the person
would get all of their function

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Absolutely true.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And even on a medieval
way, like with a system

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.400 align:middle line:84%
they created with stem
cells, harvesting them

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.280 align:middle line:84%
from fat and bone
marrow and blood,

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:40.310 align:middle line:84%
we have had amazing experiences
with quadriplegics and people

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.030 align:middle line:84%
who have had really bad spinal
cord injuries come back.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, with the neural
stuff, we can grow any cell.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.560 align:middle line:84%
There is not a
cell we can't grow.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:90%
That's fake.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.980 align:middle line:90%
That's false.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.521 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
want you to believe.

00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:55.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's the truth.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Do you believe, as
other types of insiders have

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:03.440 align:middle line:84%
said, that there is a negative
aspect to our planet at this

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:84%
time that is seeking to reduce
population dramatically?

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I do believe that.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it every day.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not hard.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I hate to call out
corporation names.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.200 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, and
things that are

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:84%
going on everywhere
with politics,

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.930 align:middle line:90%
because I try to stay neutral.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: But yes.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can just
look around and see.

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.620 align:middle line:90%
It be so easy to do.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if there was just no
electric for a couple of days.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm diabetic, and I
can't get to a Walgreens

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.210 align:middle line:90%
for my insulin shot.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.210 align:middle line:84%
You know how many people
in the world have that.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, these little
things that you don't really

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:84%
think about, it would
look so harmless

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:90%
that all these people died.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, but it was
an intentional way to do it.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, what I'm
getting at here is,

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:54.204 align:middle line:84%
if you're saying that any part
of the body could be grown,

00:27:54.204 --> 00:27:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I assume that would also mean
if somebody loses their arm,

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.040 align:middle line:84%
you could grow another arm for
them in a vat or something,

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:90%
and attach it, right?

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.611 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, it's beyond that.

00:28:01.611 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:84%
If I have just a few
of your DNA that's

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:90%
not completely destroyed.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not completely dead.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:84%
We can actually
just take that DNA

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.070 align:middle line:90%
and make your whole body back.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Because it enfolds within
it all the consciousness

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.650 align:middle line:84%
things that you have endured
through this lifetime,

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.750 align:middle line:90%
like a hard drive.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:31.470 align:middle line:90%
And you're still you.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And we can grow that,
your whole body.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Would there have to be
some sort of biologically-based

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.272 align:middle line:84%
broth, or something that you
have to feed these cells with

00:28:44.272 --> 00:28:45.480 align:middle line:90%
in order to get them to grow?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Its protein,
amino acid base,

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.500 align:middle line:90%
the very basis of life.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.440 align:middle line:84%
All of the things that you hear
about is what it's full of.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And the computer
knows when to add

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
collagen, when to add
osteocytes and osteoclasts,

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and all these different cells
in the body to help reform it.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes there is
a glitch in the printer,

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and some things happen,
but it immediately

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.700 align:middle line:84%
puts the cells in there to
fix it, which is amazing.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And these are huge
vats that, you know,

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.625 align:middle line:84%
you can basically regrow
yourself if needed.

00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: We have just
a couple minutes left.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
I wanted to cover

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:27.110 align:middle line:84%
is, in previous
episodes, you talked

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:84%
about seeing what may have
been a 10-foot tall reptilian

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:90%
in custody.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: But then you very--

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I would almost say flippantly
--oh it could've just

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:90%
been something we grew.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.100 align:middle line:90%
Like it's no big deal.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It's no big deal.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.680 align:middle line:90%
We can grow--

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: How did you get to
the point of knowing that that

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.485 align:middle line:90%
could have been done?

00:29:46.485 --> 00:29:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Because that's why
I went into the regenerative

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:54.770 align:middle line:84%
part, and started learning a
little bit more about what they

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:90%
were doing with growing cells--

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: They who?

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: --and growing things.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.510 align:middle line:90%
The labs.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: We'll
call them the labs.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:03.244 align:middle line:84%
And what they were trying
to do, like I said,

00:30:03.244 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is also make fake
extraterrestrials.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: To make, just--

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:84%
have them in their back
pocket just in case.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.350 align:middle line:84%
To make them look good, bad,
evil, or happy, or healthy,

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:19.820 align:middle line:84%
or scary, or good-looking,
whatever they wanted to do.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.340 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:90%
They're very successful with it.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So, that's why I
said, when I saw

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:32.554 align:middle line:84%
that this being, this
species or whatever, maybe--

00:30:32.554 --> 00:30:33.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
that came from.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:34.770 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I could say that I
believe it was real.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:90%
And it was smelly and breathy.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.220 align:middle line:90%
You know, it breathed.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But that's where
PLFs come in, too.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So, programmed life
forms are the same thing,

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:84%
are grown species that
are programmed to do

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.270 align:middle line:90%
certain things, certain jobs.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Without naming
anyone specifically,

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I have a story about one
of our former presidents,

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and this idea that
they can be cloned.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.190 align:middle line:10%
And that you might
be seeing someone

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:10%
who looks exactly
the same, but it

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:10.940 align:middle line:10%
could be a totally different
biological form than the one

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:10%
that's the real one.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Are you aware of that?

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, I am.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:10%
So, is there some
problem with the clone,

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.470 align:middle line:10%
in terms of like, if you
had a conversation with it,

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:10%
does it have the same memories?

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Is it aware that it's a clone?

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.377 align:middle line:84%
Or does it think
it's the same person?

00:31:26.377 --> 00:31:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It's not like I
was telling you earlier,

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:84%
when we take your
DNA and make you.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.300 align:middle line:84%
It's, we take partial parts of
your DNA, make you as a clone,

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.800 align:middle line:84%
without the
consciousness part of it.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So, we-- it's
programmed into you.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.270 align:middle line:84%
We programmed the
memories into you.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And you might think
you had a family,

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and that you knew that
you took this job, to look

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:90%
like this president.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Up to date.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:90%
All the way back.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.674 align:middle line:84%
They could even make more clones
to be put with you to make

00:31:55.674 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:90%
you think you have a family.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Or you would just think.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they just
need you for one job.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.680 align:middle line:90%
This is really intense.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.110 align:middle line:84%
That's all the time we have
in this episode of Cosmic

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Disclosure.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And we are here
with Emery Smith,

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:84%
exposing the truth about very
advanced genetic programs

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.430 align:middle line:84%
involving
extraterrestrial biology.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:28.480 align:middle line:90%
