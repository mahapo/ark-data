00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we're with Tim,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor from Germany
who analyzes and suggests

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.190 align:middle line:10%
various strategies in relation
to extraterrestrial groups

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:10%
and contact with Earth.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us today
is Captain Randy Cramer,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:10%
who claims to be the public
spokesperson for United States

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.450 align:middle line:10%
Marine Corps special section.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.820 align:middle line:84%
It's very rare we get to have
two guests at the same time

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.980 align:middle line:84%
to talk about these
types of things.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Tim, in terms of the
global military operation,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:90%
how could you elaborate on that?

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think, from
my perspective,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that people in charge
have realized a lot more

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:84%
of the benefits in growing a
successful population compared

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:84%
to a bit more self-centered
viewpoint a decade ago

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So I have more positive
thoughts about leaders and world

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:84%
governments now than
I had 10 years ago.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:84%
We already talked about future
events that could occur.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Also, I think we were talking
about breakaway situations,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and the reason why they
come back is that, whatever

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:84%
is happening on
Earth is directly

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:84%
affecting the collective
memory of the whole species.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Who is involved with these
operations making these calls?

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>> To my understanding, it's
a mixture of global groups,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:84%
elite groups, companies,
governance, and governments,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:90%
and also the military.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Are extraterrestrials
involved?

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So there are some
groups on Earth

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:84%
who participate in
strategical advisory,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and also, as we've talked
about, different species that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
have their stocks in
humanity right now.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.730 align:middle line:84%
They also have their
own agendas and thoughts

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:90%
about evolution of humanity.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, Randy, being
a military person,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.548 align:middle line:90%
what would be your perspective?

00:02:43.548 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the military
perspective is pretty

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:90%
straightforward.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
there are two choices.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.220 align:middle line:84%
We either move towards
type 1 civilization,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:90%
or we go back to the Bronze Age.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So, in looking at all of
the various problems that

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:84%
are represented in the
achievement-- moving

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:84%
towards type 1 civilization--
there's a lot of issues.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The way that the whole social
structure, political structure,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.340 align:middle line:84%
economic structure-- not to say
that all of these things are

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
going to get destroyed
in order to rebuild--

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:84%
but there are problems in
all of these structures

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that have to be addressed
in order to move to type 1.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that the
military is working the problem,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
or working the problems,
multiple problems

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
in order to clear

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:84%
the table of the things
that are interfering

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.360 align:middle line:84%
with the process of us moving
towards type 1 civilization.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some of these
problems that you mentioned?

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we still have a
lot of internal problems,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
as far as people of our
own species who don't want

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
to cooperate with
the type 1 model.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:84%
They would still like to have
a feudalistic model, in which

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.380 align:middle line:84%
a certain number of people get
to own everything at the top,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and everyone else
is serf or cattle.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of hard
to convince people

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:84%
who want to be feudalists,
and I mean really, really want

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:84%
to be feudalists, that they
should go into something

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:90%
that's more for everybody.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Type 1 civilizations make sure
that everybody on the planet is

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
a citizen and has safety net and
a floor from which they cannot

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:84%
fall through so that you
don't have homelessness,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
you don't have poverty,
you don't have crime,

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:84%
by fixing the things
that create those things.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there extraterrestrial
influences outside that are

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:90%
slowing us down from that?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say there's always
individuals who have an agenda

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
on why they might not want
that process to go quickly.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are those
who might want

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:90%
to see that process go quickly.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that?

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Different people have
different ideas about whether

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:84%
it's good for us to
be strong or not.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Some species may
see us as a threat.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Others may see us as a potential
protectorate or protector.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there's
just different motivations

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.900 align:middle line:84%
on whether we do
well or not based

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
on another species or the
civilization's own agenda.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, we spoke earlier
about this exact situation,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:84%
where maybe we're
being repressed.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, you
have mentioned that we

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:90%
are on a trajectory of success.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:90%
Could you elaborate on that?

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:90%
So Randy's absolutely correct.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.090 align:middle line:90%
There are some species--

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
because human beings,
at least on Earth,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:84%
they have a very high potential
in becoming a very evolved

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:84%
species because
experiences on Earth

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
are so diverse that
finding solutions for that

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:84%
creates a lot of new
data for the universe.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So that creates
a huge potential.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:84%
There are some species that do
not see the benefits from that,

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:84%
having a warrior-type species
that is pretty evolved.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So I absolutely agree
that some species

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:90%
try to keep humanity down.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And, to what I know, this
has been done systematically

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.270 align:middle line:84%
by altering the language
patterns of humanity,

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
by imposing a educative
structure upon Earth,

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:21.370 align:middle line:84%
by modifying timelines or
getting into time wars,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:84%
as Randy put it, genetic
blockages, and also imposing

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
a sociocultural
system that creates

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:84%
more chaos upon Earth than it
is doing any good for anybody.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying
is, they're suppressing us

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:84%
because, if we
advance too quickly,

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:84%
we might become
the super threat.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.918 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:06:49.918 --> 00:06:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Mmm, I think, for
a species to say that,

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:90%
is more of an excuse.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
More like saying, let's throw
that kid in jail before he

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:90%
grows up and be a criminal.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, we
don't know that that's

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:90%
going to happen here.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
people who are super

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:84%
nervous or judgmental on what
we're doing about that maybe

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
forget about how they had
to develop through some

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
of their own stuff
and make some choices,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and trust a little
bit that they were

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:84%
going to make some right
decisions in the long run.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think people are nervous
for all kinds of reasons

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:84%
because a developing
warrior species can

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
be a tremendous friend
or a tremendous foe.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So certainly there
are people who

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:84%
are concerned that we might
go a different direction.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's enough order
in the universe at the moment

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot of powers
that be leaning to make sure

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:90%
that comes out a different way.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
timeline where we were

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:84%
going to end up being the
oppressor in this corner

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy ended sometime
in the mid-late '80s

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.120 align:middle line:90%
or early '90s.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.250 align:middle line:84%
That was no longer
an option because we

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
made some serious
changes on who was

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
in control, who was
in charge, and who

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:90%
we were taking orders from.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying
that there's no risk.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm less concerned about that
than maybe some other species

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.567 align:middle line:84%
But, in the end,
what's going to happen

00:08:15.567 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:90%
is what's going to happen.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to have to
grow up and become adults.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And whether we become
a pleasant adult,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
responsible type adulthood
in the universe or whether we

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:90%
become the universe's--

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.909 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to choose words
there that I realized I just

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.770 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't say all of a sudden.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, if there was, guys, an
ET species out there that would

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:84%
be our alliance with us, which
species first comes to mind

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:90%
to both of you?

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, for me, it's
progenitor races.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of the
really ancient species

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.030 align:middle line:84%
are, in my understanding,
some of the most involved

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:90%
in what's happening here.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And, while they're, what I
would say, gentle nudgers--

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
they're not likely to
come in and start really

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:84%
changing things-- they'll
nudge, nudge, nudge, nudge.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:90%
But they're precise nudgers.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.492 align:middle line:84%
So when they nudge something,
they know that a lot of impacts

00:09:17.492 --> 00:09:19.450 align:middle line:84%
are going to happen from
a very specific nudge.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But I would have
to say, before I

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.850 align:middle line:84%
came to understand and
communicate with these species

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and have conversations
with them,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I was a lot more concerned about
how all of this might happen.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:84%
After having had
conversations with them,

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.873 align:middle line:84%
I'm far less concerned
about negative outcomes

00:09:35.873 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:84%
because I just don't
think they're going

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:90%
to allow it at this point.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great to hear.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Our outcome being a positive
one is way too important

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and impacts, potentially,
not just billions,

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.410 align:middle line:84%
but trillions and trillions
and trillions of lives.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You're referring to
the progenitor races as--

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The two progenitor races that
I'm familiar with are species

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
that live millions of
years, meaning that,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:84%
if you were an individual
of that species,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:84%
your lifespan would be millions
and millions of years old.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So they have a whole different
perspective on how that goes.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know how many
of these species there are.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.940 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
is, it's not a lot.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've only encountered
two in my entire career.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.090 align:middle line:84%
But because of
the length of time

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:24.030 align:middle line:84%
at which they're looking
at things, I just really--

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:84%
you just start to see
that, even if we're

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
real concerned about
what's happening here,

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:84%
there are some hands making
sure that certain things just

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:84%
don't go a way in
which would make more

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:84%
work for them because the
whole point of them tinkering

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and attempting to
get species to evolve

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:84%
is to make less work for
them because they don't want

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:90%
to babysit everybody.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
police the universe.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And they would rather
have species grow up

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:84%
to police their own
corners of the universe

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.582 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have
to do it for them.

00:10:52.582 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is, I think, one
of those situations where,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:84%
for a species that thinks about
how much resources and time

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
it has to spend on things over
millions and millions of years,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to
spend the extra time

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and resources on something that
they would have to babysit for.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
They would rather have
us do it, to be honest.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think, just in their own
self-interest of not wanting

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
to expend more time and more
resources and more personnel

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:84%
babysitting when you
can raise up an adult--

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.110 align:middle line:84%
a child species into an adult
species and let them do it,

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
it makes a lot more
sense for them.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>> So who are they?

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is a funny
thing about names.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking
about a species that's

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:84%
millions of years old,
they're way past language.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
They stopped using words and
language a long time ago.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk to them
about, well, who are you?

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.727 align:middle line:84%
Often it's like, what
do you want to call us?

00:11:46.727 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to think of it?

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So they often
refer to themselves

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:84%
as children of light,
which is a very vague term.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's also something that
you might tell a toddler

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.890 align:middle line:90%
so that it's simple for them.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.800 align:middle line:84%
We called them the
bronze ones just

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.420 align:middle line:90%
because that's their skin color.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.350 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have
a name because they

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:84%
haven't had words for millions
and millions of years.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I like that you use the
word progenitor because that is

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:90%
the beginning.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> That is the
beginning of everything.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>> So--

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.042 align:middle line:84%
>> And my understanding
from them is,

00:12:18.042 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:84%
when they came out into the
universe, started space travel,

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
they found out that the
universe was a very empty place.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And there were a lot of
planets that just had not

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:90%
come very far along at all.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were kind of
the first ones out there.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
it's lonely out here.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's make some more stuff
so we can share space

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:84%
because, yeah,
when they started,

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't a lot of species
that had gotten out there yet.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Tim, what do
you think about that?

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> First of all, I agree.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
there's something

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that is also important to keep
in mind because the universe--

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
this is not the
only reality we have

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and not the only level of
consciousness that we have.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So there are beings that
evolve into different levels

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness way down
the road, so to speak.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And even if they haven't been
materialized in this timeline,

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
in this frequency we're at right
now, they already are there.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a species
that comes to a consciousness

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
level of 6 at least, then
they have this overlook

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and this perspective
outside of time

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and upon the universe
from where they

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:84%
can influence the evolution
of everything very much.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Who do you think would
be one of our first partners

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:90%
in the alliance?

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So I could answer
similarly as Randy,

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to go
another way and just

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:90%
find some diversity to that.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I think, because this
is an ape species,

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and they have some patterns
that are typical to ape species,

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:84%
there is something that is
called "coracialism", which

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:90%
means that similar races are--

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.760 align:middle line:84%
ape species tend
to work together

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
with similar races, which means
everyone who has experienced

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.650 align:middle line:84%
a situation that is similar
to what we experience on Earth

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:84%
might be someone who steps
in and gives some advice.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Also, if we're thinking
about, for example,

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:84%
the ancient people, also
humans, or other humans,

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.740 align:middle line:84%
which are out there,
they might be--

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
because of this
specialty to ape races--

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:84%
someone who comes to
mind in the first place,

00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:00.110 align:middle line:84%
in order to work together, in
order to figure things out.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So who are the
other ape species?

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:84%
We were taught that we
were the only ape species.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no, absolutely not.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
There are some places
in the universe

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:84%
where ape species evolve and
are humanoid, so to speak.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:84%
They might have a different
approach to evolution.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:25.120 align:middle line:84%
They might have a different
planet, different options

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:90%
in order to evolve.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.607 align:middle line:84%
And also, there are some
genetics that are shared.

00:15:31.607 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>> That would make so much sense
because the DNA is so similar.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So there's other apes, humanoid
apes, on other planets,

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:84%
There are other ape species
that evolved either naturally

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:84%
or by manipulation of
genetics into what we

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:90%
could consider a human.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, what do you
have to say about this

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.310 align:middle line:84%
because there's so many other
humanoid species that evolved

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.845 align:middle line:90%
from different things?

00:16:05.845 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me see if I
can put it this way.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So if we say something
that's an insectoid species,

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.460 align:middle line:90%
that's pretty broad.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:84%
They could be from a beetle
or an ant or a dragonfly.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Those are all subspecies
that would be very different.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Something that's
a reptilian could

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:84%
come from something that's
more like a crocodile or a rock

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.240 align:middle line:84%
lizard or a snake, which
would be very different types

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:90%
of reptiles.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of think, if you
want to take another category,

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.362 align:middle line:90%
it would be mammalians.

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:84%
But when you're talking
about mammalians,

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:84%
well, that could be something
from an equine, or a horse,

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.835 align:middle line:84%
something from a dog
or a cat or a primate.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk
about apes, we're

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.590 align:middle line:90%
not even talking about apes.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
all the primates.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So you have as many different
types of evolutionary paths

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:84%
from all of these
different species lines.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.477 align:middle line:84%
So when you're just
talking about primates,

00:16:57.477 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:84%
it could be a lot
of different species

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.185 align:middle line:90%
that evolved from primates.

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And I would add that one of the
main reasons why like species

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:84%
associate is partially
because of genetics,

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:84%
partially because of
history, partially

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.829 align:middle line:90%
because of commonality.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:84%
But I would say the number
one reason is commerce.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.660 align:middle line:90%
They buy and sell similar stuff.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Genetics and
DNA, you're saying.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:16.685 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:17.518 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:17.518 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Like clothing,
food, materials--

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>> --because of
how they're made,

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:84%
what they're made of, they're
going to have similar diets,

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.625 align:middle line:84%
similar foods, similar
things that they like.

00:17:27.625 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have
similar effects from alcohol.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
have similar clothes

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:90%
that they might like to wear.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So their reasons to trade
with each other are way more--

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
like, there's a lot
more reasons to trade

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:84%
with someone who's more like you
genetically, physiologically,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:84%
than a rock person
that's 15 feet tall.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.442 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of it's trade.

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the reasons why
they want to associate

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:90%
with like species is for trade.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And it just is very
convenient that we also

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:84%
happen to share evolutionary
growth experiences

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.110 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And also some went
through the same experiences

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and liberated themselves
so they can be assistant.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.030 align:middle line:84%
We find that the curve
towards growth as a species

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.070 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of
variation, but there

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:84%
are certain things that
do come up again and again

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and again that are
common in that process.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>> And correct me if I'm wrong.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:middle line:84%
In the projects, we have known
that for many, many, many years

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.520 align:middle line:84%
that you can picture
every species

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and insect on the planet
Earth and put them

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.350 align:middle line:84%
a billion years ahead
from now, and they all

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:34.100 align:middle line:84%
have the five-star head,
two arms, two legs,

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.330 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes even more.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But they do evolve into
this-- consciously somehow--

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.540 align:middle line:84%
through this energy
into a conscious being.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that, whatever
you want to say

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.208 align:middle line:84%
is the reason why
things exist, and I

00:18:49.208 --> 00:18:50.750 align:middle line:84%
don't think anybody
knows well enough

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:84%
to say that there's a
divine source or a god

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.400 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's just
mechanical evolution--

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anybody
has enough knowledge

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.150 align:middle line:84%
to say that it's one
or the other or not.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:84%
But whatever the reason
that we exist is,

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
there are clearly patterns of
evolution, patterns of growth,

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:90%
that recur over and over again.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And we can certainly help
and benefit each other

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
from those collective
experiences of growth,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me say something to the
source thing because I think

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:23.570 align:middle line:84%
it's super interesting, at least
I found that super interesting,

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that even a very high
evolved species doesn't know

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:84%
everything, and
they make mistakes.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was something,
to find that out,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.580 align:middle line:84%
even a species that has a
perspective outside of time

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:90%
and knows how things could be--

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:84%
they don't know if
random things appear

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:90%
and things turn out differently.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:84%
That was super
interesting to experience.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you telling me
extraterrestrials that are very

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:90%
elevated also see UFOs?

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you that
extraterrestrials

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:05.220 align:middle line:84%
who know millions
and millions of years

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and have billions of data
about the universe-- they also

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:84%
do not know if there
is a god or not.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
They tend to call it
source or something.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.630 align:middle line:84%
They know that there
is a life form.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But they also do
not know, which--

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:84%
one of the questions they
said is still not solved

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:90%
is, is it infinite or not?

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Is the universe coming to
an end at some point or not,

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:84%
which needs to be played
out, and it will take time.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And nobody knows
those answers.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I would say, to simplify
that, it doesn't matter

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.650 align:middle line:84%
how big your cranium
or your brain

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:84%
or how many
densities up you are.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:84%
You can still screw up
just like anybody else

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and make a mistake.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>> But it gets easier,
the more you evolve.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>> So they say.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>> They say.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> So they say.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm waiting for that still.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have beings that are
billions of years old that have

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:90%
been around forever.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And people are
wondering, well, they

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:84%
should be smart enough to know
where they originated from,

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.850 align:middle line:90%
to how to protect themselves.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:84%
But as we kind of know,
that's not actually the truth.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would say the oldest
species that we know of are

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
millions of years old,
not more than that.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So even those species
don't know what

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.680 align:middle line:90%
happened a billion years ago.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:84%
They have theory,
and they have--

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.430 align:middle line:84%
they can look at charts
and the movement of stars

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and how stars are
formed and collapse

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and so forth to come up with
their own theories and guesses.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
But a billion years ago
to them is still way too

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.200 align:middle line:84%
long ago to be able to have any
kind of accurate understanding.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would say the most
important thing here is how

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:84%
perspective does gain
you certain precision

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.800 align:middle line:84%
But it also has a way of
making other information

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.280 align:middle line:84%
more shadowy or
obfuscated or complex.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:84%
You may have a perspective
as an old, developed species.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
This is how you
know things work.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that
you understand how

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.310 align:middle line:84%
every planet, every
consciousness, every species--

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, because
you're in your own head.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
You're from your
own perspective.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.400 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at the
development of a species,

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:84%
you may be looking down
at them in such a way

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.690 align:middle line:84%
that you're really not
understanding where they are.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:84%
You may have been there a
very, very long time ago.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:84%
But you're-- I would challenge
anyone over 50 to look

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.698 align:middle line:84%
at a five-year-old and really
try and understand what that

00:22:34.698 --> 00:22:36.990 align:middle line:84%
five-year-old is going through
because you can remember

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:84%
exactly what it was
like to be five.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I think most people
would kind of feel like,

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- do I remember
what it was like to be five?

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.370 align:middle line:90%
Like, that's perspective change.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And so once you get
a certain ways away

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:84%
from a certain perspective,
you lose understanding.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the farther you get
away from certain perspectives,

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:84%
the farther your
understanding goes.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So you can be super
evolved and just

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:84%
not know the first step of
how to get a certain species

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:84%
to grow or evolve or change
because it's not your species.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And even if you have experience
with hundreds or thousands

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
of other species, well, maybe
you haven't done this species.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think it doesn't
matter how smart you are.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter how
experienced you are.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't have all of the
perspectives of the universe,

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.140 align:middle line:84%
that there's just going to
be certain things you don't

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:84%
understand or that you
have the perspective

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:84%
of to have an awareness
of that's accurate.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great way to put it.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Also, time is not consistent.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So the way temporal
dynamics works is that,

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.450 align:middle line:84%
when things fail, they
get merged together.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So people can have
a different history.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Some species, when
you're talking

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:84%
about the Greys or
some other species,

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:51.490 align:middle line:84%
they have a total different
mindset information

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.100 align:middle line:90%
on how things were in the past.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And others, they have a
different take on that,

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:90%
and probably both are correct.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just that time, in
some ways or another,

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:84%
merged and became
what we have now.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, following up with
what you just said, Tim--

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Randy, where is this going with
this global military operation

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.390 align:middle line:90%
for humanity?

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I spent a lot of time having
conversations with my brigadier

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:84%
general over the year, and I
would say that we have a very

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.250 align:middle line:84%
fluid, very dynamic
situation at the moment.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So it could go any
number of ways.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I realize I say, I think
it's going to go like this.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
We think it's going
to go like this.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I want to also fully say,
it's a fluid situation.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't
go like I say, don't

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.730 align:middle line:84%
hold me responsible for
saying it was the gospel truth

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.170 align:middle line:90%
because I've never said that.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But I think that where it
leaves us is that somebody's

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.290 align:middle line:84%
attempting to steer the
boat and understands what's

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:84%
at stake, what's important,
and the people who understand

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.730 align:middle line:84%
that are going to do
the very, very best

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.800 align:middle line:84%
they can to make sure
that this comes out OK.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So the conversations
that he and I

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
have about what he does on a
daily basis, who he talks to,

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
what conversations they're
having, I would say that,

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:84%
in spite of people who don't
want things to go well,

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.340 align:middle line:84%
or who would like to
things to stay the same,

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.810 align:middle line:84%
there is a majority of
rational thinking voices

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that understand, if we don't
make the positive changes

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.210 align:middle line:90%
necessary, there will be no us.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.380 align:middle line:90%
There will be no future.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:84%
There will be
nothing to maintain.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think, ultimately, if I
was a betting man, and I'm not,

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:84%
but if I was, I
would bet that this

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:84%
is going to go way
better than it's

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.710 align:middle line:84%
going to go way worse because
some of the best people, best

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
minds, best of everything
are working the problem.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean it's
automatically going to be,

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:90%
(EXCITED) woo and awesome?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:51.390 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:90%
It does not mean that.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:84%
But the best minds and
the best bodies are on it.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And so, if I was going to put
my faith in something, and I do,

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I would rather put my
faith in those people

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
than I would put in a
bunch of monkey wrenchers

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.472 align:middle line:84%
who are just trying
to throw us off.

00:26:06.472 --> 00:26:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And you've been getting
this intel for many, many,

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.480 align:middle line:90%
many years.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.563 align:middle line:84%
So you've seen the graduation
of this trajectory--

00:26:11.563 --> 00:26:12.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:26:12.363 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And it probably
changes every day.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.743 align:middle line:84%
>> It changes on a
very regular basis.

00:26:15.743 --> 00:26:16.543 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:16.543 --> 00:26:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I will just say that
the intel that I get

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.212 align:middle line:84%
has always been accurate,
even as I go through to source

00:26:23.212 --> 00:26:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and check different things
because I don't just

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.260 align:middle line:84%
take what my intel guys
tell me as gospel truth.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:90%
I check data.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.658 align:middle line:84%
I cross-reference
data and information

00:26:31.658 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that it matches up
with known variables or known

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:90%
data sets.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And so far, they've never
been wrong about anything.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.300 align:middle line:90%
They've never lied.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:90%
They've never misled me.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.710 align:middle line:90%
They've never been wrong.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So at this point,
I have every reason

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:49.350 align:middle line:84%
to trust them and believe that
they have the best people on it

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
because that's been
my experience of them.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So as crazy and
chaotic as it seems,

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I would say that this
is going to end up way

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:84%
better than it could
possibly end up way worse.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But we certainly are at a
time when a lot of variables

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:90%
are playing out.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:90%
It could go this way.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.420 align:middle line:90%
It could go that way.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.560 align:middle line:90%
People want to nudge this way.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:90%
People want to nudge that way.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So I think, in
that chaos moment,

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.770 align:middle line:84%
you could choose to
look at any outcome

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.030 align:middle line:90%
and see the possibility of it.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
You could go, oh, well,
it could end up like this.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.548 align:middle line:84%
Or it could go bad like
that or good like this.

00:27:18.548 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:84%
All the probabilities and
possibilities are out there,

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.632 align:middle line:84%
but we're only going to
end up on one of them.

00:27:23.632 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, you want
to talk about parallel--

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I'm trying to keep
it simple and not talk about

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:84%
the parallels, and
the break aparts,

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and the expansion and
contraction process of that,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and how we go from more to
less to more to less and all

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:37.950 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.158 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to keep it simple.

00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But, given that where we are
right now, there's only one

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.152 align:middle line:84%
of those options
that's going to happen.

00:27:46.152 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
lot of people who

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.340 align:middle line:84%
are very motivated to make
sure that that's the best case

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:84%
scenario and not the
worst case scenario.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, what's
your take on that?

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I totally agree again.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said that, I think in
the first episode we ever

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:05.320 align:middle line:84%
made, that this is a very
fluid process right now.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So I know a lot of the
scenarios that could play out.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I know that for every
possible scenario

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that anyone could think of,
there are different narratives,

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.110 align:middle line:90%
different strategies to that.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And depending on what the
stats and numbers are,

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:84%
it's like in real time
decided what's going to--

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.110 align:middle line:90%
how do we react upon that?

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only
humanity that's

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.270 align:middle line:84%
involved in this
global operation.

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:39.780 align:middle line:84%
There are other
beings, other species,

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:46.470 align:middle line:84%
higher frequential beings that
are also participating in that.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:50.070 align:middle line:84%
As Randy, I'm even
more convinced

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:53.250 align:middle line:84%
that this will turn
out very, very well.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, let's all hope so.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have a lot of
optimism about our trajectory.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.080 align:middle line:90%
What makes you believe that?

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all,
as Randy also put it,

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:84%
people have realized the
importance of the shift.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural process.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:90%
So there is no avoidance to it.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.320 align:middle line:84%
It will turn out in
some way or another.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:10%
And people-- so the
specifica of this race

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:10%
is that they want to try
to keep on the narrative

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:10%
as closely as they can.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
is the reason why

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:31.800 align:middle line:84%
we have so many discussions
and so many variables

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and so many points
to react upon things.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, the
intelligence that

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.970 align:middle line:84%
is occupied with this
kind of operation--

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.940 align:middle line:84%
this is not only human
intelligence, not only

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:84%
human brains that put their
data and skills into that.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.490 align:middle line:84%
There are different
other species

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and a unbelievable high
potential of intelligence

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:90%
that got involved here.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
intelligence agencies,

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:15.930 align:middle line:84%
but I'm talking about a,
like, a high intelligence

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.840 align:middle line:84%
that the universe has
in order to preserve

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.910 align:middle line:84%
the healthy evolution
of everything.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.210 align:middle line:84%
It's still the universe
that's evolving.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that it
cannot turn out badly,

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:84%
but I'm pretty convinced that
there are answers to many,

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.730 align:middle line:84%
many scenarios
that are probably--

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.860 align:middle line:90%
the probability is to occur.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And that gives me some relief.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Tim.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, thanks for being on
the show, Randy and Tim.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Super great.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.890 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate the
perspectives and the talk.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What other ET races are
influencing our planet?

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, we're heading
towards the really,

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:12.790 align:middle line:84%
really dark abyss
of the universe.

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And this species seem to have
developed some tactics around

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.890 align:middle line:84%
fear and angst-- what
we call it in German--

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:25.630 align:middle line:84%
