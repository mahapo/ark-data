00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:15.059 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID WILCOCK: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.450 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Since information in
these classified programs

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.850 align:middle line:84%
is so compartmentalized
and difficult to get,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.170 align:middle line:84%
how do you actually achieve
a level of knowledge

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:90%
within the classified world?

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:84%
What does it take to get
a security clearance?

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And how do you progress through
these various stages and ranks

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:90%
to get to the good stuff?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.422 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY SMITH: Thanks, Dave.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So the first thing
I'd like to start with is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:90%
an audience question.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is, how did you
train to become a technician?

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:90%
What was your training?

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:90%
How did you get this training?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So could you please give us more
information on that exactly?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Sure.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.057 align:middle line:10%
And this is nothing secret or
different than any other person

00:01:01.057 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:10%
that joins the military that
picks a classification they

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:10%
want to go into.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.119 align:middle line:84%
I went in to
surgical technology.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you get
different classifications

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.339 align:middle line:84%
because you can completely
continue your education

00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
with the Community
College of the Air

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Force and their
technician programs,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:84%
such as after basic
training, which I only

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
had to do a few weeks of because
of my prior military training

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:90%
as a teenager.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.348 align:middle line:84%
I was immediately shipped
to Sheppard Air Force

00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:90%
Base in Wichita Falls, Texas.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I went
through an extensive training

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
of surgical technology and
also surgical first assisting.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:84%
From there, you get
deployed to another area,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:84%
such as I was deployed to an
air transportable hospital

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:84%
at England Air Force
Base, Louisiana.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
these places where

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.360 align:middle line:84%
out of just a couple C-130s, we
can drop down a whole hospital,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:84%
have it ready to go in 24
hours anywhere in the world.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So that was my training
just for the basics

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.025 align:middle line:90%
of the surgical technology.

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:51.691 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
learned a lot of this

00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:53.369 align:middle line:84%
and trained under
many great physicians.

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I
went to Kirtland Air Force

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Base in Albuquerque, New
Mexico and trained through

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:90%
the hospital system there.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:90%
You're always in training.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:84%
There's always new
things coming out.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:90%
There's always new techniques.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:84%
A good example of this
is just doing CPR.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And CPR last year and the year
before-- it keeps changing.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a different
amount of breaths

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:84%
or a different amount
of chest compressions.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be allocated
and get your CMEs accredited

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
for doctors and nurses
and all medical people.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:84%
It's an ongoing, continuing
education program.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.205 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was great
because I'm high energy.

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to learn
more and more and more.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force just
kept feeding it to me.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So given that this
was obviously very intensive

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:84%
training, did you also receive
knowledge that would not be

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
given to people if they
went to a university?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: That's
absolutely correct.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
The things that I've learned
through the military-industrial

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:84%
complex and the
military itself--

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.065 align:middle line:84%
because I was doing both
civilian and military working

00:02:52.065 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:84%
at the same time I
was active duty--

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
the types of training
and education

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
is not available to
the general public.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.429 align:middle line:84%
And that's because of
the different types

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and compartmentalized programs
that I was working with.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:84%
You had to get
additional training.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:84%
You had to take different
courses and things

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
with electromagnetics
and sciences,

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:84%
even with medicine,
that were not out yet.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that usually
after five or 10 years,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:84%
some of these things would go
out, like harmonic scalpels.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
They were using that
in the early '80s,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.055 align:middle line:84%
and it really didn't come
forward until the early '90s.

00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:90%
And then it became mainstream.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: In a previous episode,
you mentioned that you had some

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.897 align:middle line:84%
kind of high school program that
started you in the military.

00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Sure, yep.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So could
you delineate for us--

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.830 align:middle line:84%
how old were you when you
got into the military?

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And how long did
it take before you

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:84%
started to get invited
into secret projects?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The first thing I
joined was Civil Air Patrol

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:90%
at the age of 13.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.169 align:middle line:84%
It's an auxiliary
to the Air Force.

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:90%
It's in many, many communities.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not a secret.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, during Civil Air Patrol,
I also took Army ROTC.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's just a normal thing
that's in most high schools.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a really
good affinity for the Army

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.747 align:middle line:84%
because during the four years,
I did a lot of encampments.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of these are two
weeks to a month long.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.788 align:middle line:84%
Some of the survival missions
of the Civil Air Patrol

00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
could be up to a week long
in very desolate areas

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And they teach you things-- like
I said, first aid and search

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:90%
and rescue.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So search and rescue
is the biggest thing.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
How do you utilize an ELT,
Emergency Locating Transmitting

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:84%
device, which is located
in every aircraft

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
in the tail section
and also every boat.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: At what point did you
start to encounter information

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
that was classified enough that
it would really trip people out

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.740 align:middle line:84%
if they hadn't already ever
heard about this before?

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Probably
my sophomore year.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.965 align:middle line:84%
We all take these tests
called the ASVAB test.

00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:84%
It gives you job
placement in the military.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But I was getting
additional ASVABs

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
where I had to travel to
MacDill Air Force Base

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and take a test every weekend.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
My Army ROTC commander says
this is just additional things

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:90%
they ask for some people.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I thought maybe
I didn't do good on the ASVAB,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.399 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't.

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Later out, I found out that
these are test additionally

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:84%
they test children with to
measure their consciousness

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:90%
and collective state.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So what did these
tests lead to if you got

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:90%
positive results?

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Did you end up in a briefing?

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Did somebody hand you
a stack of documents?

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Nothing really
was strange up until I went

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:84%
to England Air Force Base,
my first duty assignment

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:84%
in Alexandria, Louisiana right
next to Fort Polk Army Base.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, it
was really interesting

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.302 align:middle line:90%
that, oh, my gosh.

00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:84%
You're now being assigned
to Kirtland Air Force

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Base out of nowhere.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else
went somewhere else--

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:84%
all my other
colleagues and airmen.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's where things
started taking off--

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.409 align:middle line:90%
when I went to Kirtland.

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.462 align:middle line:84%
And I had a really great
feeling about this move.

00:05:58.462 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So I was excited to
get out of the swamp,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.059 align:middle line:84%
get into the mountains
in the higher atmosphere.

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Did somebody give you
like a knowing look or a wink

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:90%
or a pat on the shoulder?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:84%
They treated me at Kirtland
Air Force Base a lot better

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:84%
than they did at
England Air Force Base.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And I knew there was
something going on.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Because when I went
there, I immediately

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:84%
was in charge directly
and indirectly

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.990 align:middle line:84%
of maybe 30
different technicians

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and surgical specialists
because I already

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.982 align:middle line:90%
had a lot of experience.

00:06:28.982 --> 00:06:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
you know is when

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:90%
they approached me and said--

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
one of the commanders there
approached me and said, hey.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:84%
We have additional things
that you could work on

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
if you want additional trainings
and additional education

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.970 align:middle line:90%
if you'd like.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And we would actually
allow you to leave

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:90%
work early to do these things.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And some of these were
just trauma training,

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
air evac training, flight
medicine, things like this.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.304 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
knew right away, wow.

00:06:56.304 --> 00:06:58.220 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be a
really great opportunity

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:84%
for me not only to
get more ribbons

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:84%
but to get promoted
faster and be

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
part of other
compartmentalized programs.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
came to me and asked me

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
after I did another
additional training,

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:84%
would you like to
moonlight for this new wing

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:84%
of the military that has to
do with harvesting organs?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was, of course,
more than welcome

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:84%
to sign that paper because
I wanted, of course, to be

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:90%
more financially stable.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't get paid anything
in the military, as you know.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.986 align:middle line:90%
And it was easy for me to--

00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:90%
I had so much energy.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It was easy for me to
start a job at 6:00 PM

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and work to 1:00 AM and
then get back up at 4:00 AM

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and be at work at 5:00 PM
and do this over and over.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:84%
I was in great shape back
then because I was working out

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:90%
two hours a day.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And the training
alone was amazing.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.401 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of neat travel was
involved with these things--

00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
having to go to different
Air Force bases,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.340 align:middle line:84%
like Holloman Air Force Base
and White Sands Missile Range

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and some others that
I won't talk about.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And it just opened up,
I think, the area for me

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:84%
to slip into this
compartmentalized program.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
realized I was not

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
going to be doing organ
harvesting on soldiers.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So you described
in previous episodes that

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
the original nine months of your
time doing these autopsies were

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
kind of boring little squares
or rectangles of tissue.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Correct.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So did anybody ever
actually give you a briefing?

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
the insiders I've

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:84%
spoken to-- let me
just say the context.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:90%
They get sat down at some point.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.320 align:middle line:90%
They get shown weird films.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:90%
Or they get told things.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.186 align:middle line:84%
Or they are given a huge
stack of paper to read.

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's a commonality
in a lot of these stories.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wondering, if you're
getting these little squares

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:84%
of tissue, had you been given
any of that kind of a briefing

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:84%
before that made you at
all anticipate that this

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:90%
might be something weird?

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It really wasn't
until maybe six or nine months

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:84%
into the program where I
started getting special classes,

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:84%
we'll say, and instruction
that in order for you to work

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
in a different operating room
or a different area or different

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:84%
wing, you would have to
go through these training

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.090 align:middle line:90%
instruction courses.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:90%
And it would cover things.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And the word I did
hear was "tissue other

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:90%
than Earth origin."

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: They used that term?

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, they did.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
knew later on what

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:90%
was really taking place here.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was true
or not, the stuff

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I was working on
definitely did not

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.060 align:middle line:84%
look like any type of
human bodily material

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.727 align:middle line:90%
or fluid by far.

00:09:39.727 --> 00:09:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Were these
no questions briefings?

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Or were you able to
interact with someone

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.290 align:middle line:90%
who was telling you things?

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Once every two
weeks, you would get an actual

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.770 align:middle line:84%
briefing from a head
scientist or a commander.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.739 align:middle line:84%
But most instructions-- like as
far as getting upgraded to go

00:09:55.739 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
somewhere else and you have to
take different courses through

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.830 align:middle line:84%
them, which are very short
courses anywhere from two

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.010 align:middle line:84%
to three hours of the things
that you might encounter

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:90%
or work on--

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
definitely pointed
into the direction

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial genetics
and DNA and tissues.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, I know
when I was college--

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and a good friend of mine
had his physics professor,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:84%
the head of department, tell
him NASA knew we were not alone,

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that the Roswell crash
was real, that it

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.283 align:middle line:84%
was common knowledge
in the higher echelons,

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:84%
that he worked
there in the 1970s.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:90%
My mind exploded with questions.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I read 300 books in the last
three years I was in school--

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
so 100 books a year
two books a week--

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:90%
all on this kind of stuff.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I would imagine-- at
least if you were me--

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
the fire of curiosity that
would have been ignited

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
in your mind, the
desire to just want

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
to interrogate, what do you
mean tissue of non-Earth origin?

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Where are they from?

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:84%
What kind of craft
did they come in?

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:90%
What's their agenda?

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.116 align:middle line:90%
Are they trying to kill us?

00:10:56.116 --> 00:10:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Are they trying to help us?

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.739 align:middle line:84%
Are they the gods that we see
in Sumerian cuneiform tablets?

00:11:00.739 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Did you ask these
kinds of questions?

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.488 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Absolutely not,
because I would not be part

00:11:04.488 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:84%
of the program if I did
at that early of a stage.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.999 align:middle line:84%
Later on, it was a
little different.

00:11:09.999 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
They got a little bit
more lax after you've

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:90%
been with them for three years.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Things are very
more lackadaisical

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
where the team will share with
you information like, we've

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.190 align:middle line:90%
heard it came from this system.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.210 align:middle line:84%
We heard because we've seen
this before with our prior notes

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
from 10 or 20 years ago because
of these different types

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.070 align:middle line:90%
of rivets--

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying for an example--

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
or these types of mechanics
or these types of energies.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Especially frequencies
was their big thing--

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:84%
monitoring frequencies of DNA
cells, craft, and all this.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is how they were
building their encyclopedia

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.030 align:middle line:84%
of all these different
tissue samples, all

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
these different
extraterrestrial beings.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:90%
So it was very captivating.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And yes, for me,
it was addictive.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:90%
I was addicted to it.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.439 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to go to work.

00:11:59.439 --> 00:12:00.730 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to see the next thing.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask questions
but couldn't but hoped maybe

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I would be brought
onto another program

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:84%
through working on this being--
that since I worked on it

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and was comfortable with it,
they would show me the craft it

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.127 align:middle line:90%
came in, things like this.

00:12:12.127 --> 00:12:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Did they
ever make mistakes?

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Did they accidentally
let you know something

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.250 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't really
want you to know?

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Always.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Constantly.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.586 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What
would be a mistake?

00:12:20.586 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: A mistake would
be to have the technicians

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:84%
in a meeting where the
meeting was really just

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:32.220 align:middle line:84%
for the managers of that body
or of that device or of that

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.210 align:middle line:90%
craft.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So there was many times where
they cut the meeting short,

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and we would have
to leave the room.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And the people that were
running that operating

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:84%
room or that piece of equipment
or extraterrestrial autopsy

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:53.700 align:middle line:84%
would be informed of many
more things of information,

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.535 align:middle line:84%
such as later on I found
out where they came from,

00:12:58.535 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:84%
what exact planet
they came from,

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:90%
what, system they came from.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Are they dimensional,
interdimensional?

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Are they the five-star,
and why is that?

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: The human shape with
the head, two arms, two legs.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And if not, why
aren't they five-star?

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they were maybe
developed by these ETs.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:84%
There was many ETs that
we found that had pets

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:84%
with them and extraterrestrial
pets that we later coined

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and was trying to put
a species to that--

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:90%
a separation.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.544 align:middle line:84%
And they're also
from the same system.

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And there was actually
extraterrestrials

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that had a species that were
transporting large beings.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.660 align:middle line:84%
But they were not
extraterrestrials.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.710 align:middle line:84%
We would see elephants
and things like this--

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
that they did not come
from their system.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they were
poaching these things

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.050 align:middle line:84%
or bringing them
back or whatnot.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:52.590 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't elaborate.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Because until you
get to that level

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.470 align:middle line:84%
to know almost
everything, you really

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.030 align:middle line:84%
have to be in there
a very long time.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And I, unfortunately,
left at a very early time.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So let's try to
delve in a little bit more

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:84%
to the, if you will, hierarchy
of a place like Kirtland Air

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Force Base, where things started
to get interesting for you.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you end up getting
deeply enmeshed in this system

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.280 align:middle line:84%
of clearance,
classification, access,

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:84%
what doors does your key card
open, or whatever kind of thing

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.060 align:middle line:90%
it is you have there.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So could you kind of
break down for us--

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:84%
what are the different
tiers, the different levels

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:34.800 align:middle line:90%
of clearance?

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And could there be people on the
base who have no frickin' idea

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:90%
what's really going on there?

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.069 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Absolutely.

00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:44.360 align:middle line:90%
People have to understand, too.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.286 align:middle line:84%
On the base, when
people are like,

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
well, he's on Kirtland
Air Force Base--

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and Sandia Lab Base is on
Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.190 align:middle line:84%
It has its own security
and everything.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And all those
sublevels down there

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.355 align:middle line:84%
are also contracted out by
many different corporations

00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:84%
of the military
industrial complex.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's not United States
Air Force doing this.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
We're the security
for that facility.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Army is the security
for that facility on Army bases.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:84%
They do not know anything
of what's going on in there.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.100 align:middle line:90%
They know it's top secret.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:84%
They know it could be harmful if
any of the information got out.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.045 align:middle line:84%
It could be detrimental
to Americans.

00:15:22.045 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
We could lose a
huge rocket program

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:84%
just if the information
got out to our enemies.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's different
classifications

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:84%
of who owns these
different types of levels

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:84%
of laboratories and whatnot and
the different testing going on.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, getting back to
what you just said,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:84%
it's usually three
to four months

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
when you're working with
these types of program--

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.660 align:middle line:84%
through my experience
only with medical--

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.540 align:middle line:84%
that you would have
to really stick

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.310 align:middle line:84%
to the rules and
regulations, which

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:90%
are really basic at first.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.520 align:middle line:90%
You can't talk to anybody.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.520 align:middle line:90%
You can't tell anybody.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to be on
any types of drugs or alcohol.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.770 align:middle line:90%
You're tested every two weeks.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's these restrictions
for me at that time

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
that it was a really
great shoe-in, because I

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.460 align:middle line:90%
didn't have to do anything.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:90%
All I had to do was show up.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.230 align:middle line:84%
All I had to do was
work and then leave.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And after every four
months, you get one up.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:90%
It's called a "one up."

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And one up means you're going to
get another security clearance

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:84%
if they do a report
on you that you

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.810 align:middle line:90%
did what you're supposed to do.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And background checks
constantly-- everything.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
If you get pulled over
for a speeding ticket,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:84%
you best be on the
phone and let them know.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:44.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to tell them within six
to eight hours if anything that

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
you did was wrong,
if you got arrested,

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:84%
or got a speeding ticket--
just little things--

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.470 align:middle line:84%
or if you're not getting
along with your commander,

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:84%
with your active duty
job, any little things,

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.190 align:middle line:84%
or if you're getting harassed
by active duty members, which

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.380 align:middle line:84%
I was getting
harassed because they

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:84%
didn't understand why I was
only working 75% of the shift.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:84%
But I was being pulled into
other compartmentalized

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:06.960 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.812 align:middle line:84%
They would sometimes
base it off of an injury

00:17:10.812 --> 00:17:11.770 align:middle line:90%
to tell the commanders.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.353 align:middle line:84%
Because they were really tight,
but the commanders don't know.

00:17:14.353 --> 00:17:15.730 align:middle line:90%
All they know is--

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:90%
like one of my buddies.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.552 align:middle line:84%
He was pulled out
because he spoke a couple

00:17:19.552 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:90%
of different languages.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.135 align:middle line:84%
So his excuse to work
in these programs

00:17:22.135 --> 00:17:23.950 align:middle line:90%
was he was a linguistics expert.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:90%
So they would do these things.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And they would actually lie to
my military non-commissioned

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.110 align:middle line:84%
officer saying,
well, we need him

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:84%
because he has to decipher
this because he was Polish

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:90%
or he was German or Russian.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they were really good
about getting around it.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And then no one really
asked after a while.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: You brought up
lying, and that made me think

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:90%
of something else.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
If you have Air Force and Army
soldiers essentially working

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.520 align:middle line:84%
security knowing something
top secret is going on

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.740 align:middle line:84%
but not really
knowing what it is,

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.010 align:middle line:84%
was there some type
of disinformation

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.881 align:middle line:84%
that was planted to them
to satisfy their curiosity

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle line:84%
but might not have been anywhere
near as interesting as what

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.180 align:middle line:90%
it really was?

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They would do that
if they suspected someone was

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.720 align:middle line:84%
starting-- leaking
information, absolutely As soon

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:84%
as information is leaked or
they see security guards talking

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:84%
or inappropriate talking on
the radios or cell phones

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:84%
or mobiles, they would
immediately send out

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:84%
a disinformation campaign and
then wrap it up by the end

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.806 align:middle line:90%
of the week saying, oh.

00:18:28.806 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
That was just because
of this, this, or this.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But then it would really
get everyone's energy.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.380 align:middle line:90%
This thing was there.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:90%
We saw it, and it escaped.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But no, it really didn't,
because this was just someone's

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
pet tiger that we
had in there that

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.396 align:middle line:90%
were used for testing drugs on.

00:18:48.396 --> 00:18:50.270 align:middle line:84%
These weird things would
happen all the time.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So they would really
try to hide it.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And if there was
actually a person

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.430 align:middle line:84%
that visualized something, then
they would end up being killed.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So do you think
that these Army and Air Force

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.560 align:middle line:84%
personnel had any ability to
even imagine what they were

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.120 align:middle line:90%
actually sitting on?

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.720 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:84%
They're young cadets,
young soldiers

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:84%
that are just waiting to get
off shift so they can go work

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.650 align:middle line:90%
out or have a good time.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:84%
They kept it like that
for a good reason.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And they would not be
debriefed on anything--

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.692 align:middle line:84%
the soldiers that
were checking you in,

00:19:25.692 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
the soldiers that were allowing
you to go through the gate.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: You mentioned
clearances going one up every

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:90%
four months.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Could you give us some idea
of what those clearances are?

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And let's get a little bit
more specific about that.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Is it a alphanumeric code?

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Is there a name for it?

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.198 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot of pop
culture stuff you see online--

00:19:47.198 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle line:84%
people talking about different
things, people referring to me

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
as he had "umbra
classification," which

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.310 align:middle line:84%
is an old term we
don't use anymore.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:20:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And now it's more like levels
of numeric levels of alpha 22,

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.040 align:middle line:90%
beta 17.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
whole slew of that.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And all those refer to
different types of bases

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and different types
of work you do.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I made up to level alpha
22, and that's all I know.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
There was no pop culture
term back then for that.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.295 align:middle line:90%
I was just an A22.

00:20:21.295 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: The letters
corresponded to a particular

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.930 align:middle line:90%
base?

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: To a particular
unit within the base.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So there might be energy
testing, aircraft testing,

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.279 align:middle line:84%
biological testing, all
these different things.

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And the first letter
doesn't mean anything.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.070 align:middle line:84%
It's just a letter
that when you came in,

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:90%
this is where your program is.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:90%
And it can change.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:84%
It actually could change
to a different letter

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and different number if you
got transferred to another base

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.416 align:middle line:90%
or a different project.

00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:84%
For me, I was
pretty consolidated

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.410 align:middle line:84%
because all my
stuff was medical.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of stayed with that.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I did get to work
on some aircraft,

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.980 align:middle line:84%
but more like taking
specimens from aircraft,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:84%
not learning the propulsion
systems of those aircraft.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So an A22 in one base
could be completely different

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:90%
than an A22 in another base.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, it's
standard in North America.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It's different than
Europe and Australia.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.400 align:middle line:90%
They have their own thing.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:84%
But you would have
clinicians, physicians,

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials
in your base

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:90%
that were from these bases.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And they had different markings
and different codes and names.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So would you wear
something that said A22?

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.350 align:middle line:90%
It's on your band.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Remember the band?

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: You mentioned
the band before.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Everything
is on the band.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.135 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So they might not
want other people on the base

00:21:40.135 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:90%
to know what your rank is.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:46.484 align:middle line:84%
That's a really bad thing
because you could trick someone

00:21:46.484 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:84%
into telling you
something if they

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:90%
thought you were classified.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And that would be really
bad, and that has happened.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't make it.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What you're describing
here is so seemingly fantastic

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.260 align:middle line:84%
that for most people
watching the show,

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:84%
this would be only approachable
as science fiction.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they want to believe you,
but something holds them back

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:16.540 align:middle line:84%
from really accepting
that this is true.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.987 align:middle line:84%
Now, for me, the scope
of what you're saying,

00:22:18.987 --> 00:22:20.570 align:middle line:84%
the complexity of
what you're saying--

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
that's when I know
somebody is real.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Because you can't make that up.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:90%
It's too dense.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.400 align:middle line:90%
What you're talking about here--

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
clearly you're giving
up some things.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:90%
You're sacrificing some things.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.750 align:middle line:84%
You're sacrificing the ability
to talk to people about this.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:90%
You can't even have friends.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:90%
You don't get to ask questions.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:84%
So could you explain
some of the sacrifices

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:84%
that you've been through in
this amazing environment?

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The technology
that I was working

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:84%
on and the different projects
that I was included in can cure

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.360 align:middle line:90%
the world's water problem.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It can clean up
Fukushima in seven days.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:84%
It can get all that trash off
the coast of China, Japan--

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of acres of this stuff.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And personally, myself with my
family coming down with cancer,

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:90%
let's say-- my mother.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:84%
This could have all been
avoided if they would just

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:21.170 align:middle line:90%
release this information.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.560 align:middle line:84%
So I came to a point after
working on zero-point energy

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.350 align:middle line:84%
devices and getting
one to actually operate

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and getting it validated
by a few laboratories

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.604 align:middle line:84%
that my life started
getting threatened.

00:23:34.604 --> 00:23:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't because of
the extraterrestrial stuff.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.061 align:middle line:84%
It was because I
was possibly-- they

00:23:39.061 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
thought maybe I was going
to bring something out

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to the public without
the knowledge of them.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very compassionate
about getting this stuff out.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And I really thought
and feel that my life

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.700 align:middle line:84%
is in a little bit of danger
with all the threats going on

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and the phone calls and
the constant harassment.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:84%
You can't have a
normal life like this.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:90%
Your family is at jeopardy.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Your wife is at jeopardy.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Your friends are at jeopardy.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.780 align:middle line:84%
People don't want to
be associated with you.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.860 align:middle line:84%
My colleagues through many
of my major corporations

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:84%
turned on me because
they didn't want to--

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:84%
even though I'm a 50%
owner of a corporation,

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.020 align:middle line:84%
they just stood
back and said, we

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.510 align:middle line:84%
don't want this to reflect
on the corporation's belief

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.380 align:middle line:90%
system--

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.500 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrials exist
and zero-point energy and all

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:84%
these crazy things
unless they're making

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.300 align:middle line:90%
billions of dollars off it.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So it shows that they're just
so non-integrous people that

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.500 align:middle line:84%
are looking at just to make
money off certain things

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and don't want
anything to do with it.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's people
that are just--

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.023 align:middle line:84%
they feel that if they're
associated with me

00:24:45.023 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:84%
that their lives
would be put at risk.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot of weight to
carry on your shoulders.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not stopping just
because someone's harassing me

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.900 align:middle line:90%
or someone is trying to kill me.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.807 align:middle line:90%
I get all these remarks online.

00:24:59.807 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of
people that don't agree.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to agree.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm not telling you to agree.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you my story.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling it truthfully.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you,
go out for yourself

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.027 align:middle line:84%
and find out, because it's
the only way you're really

00:25:13.027 --> 00:25:13.860 align:middle line:90%
going to believe it.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.693 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, I want to thank
you for your bravery in coming

00:25:17.693 --> 00:25:19.200 align:middle line:90%
forward like this.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Something flashed in my
head as you were talking,

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and that is going
back to the base.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about sacrifices.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious if there
was ever a scene where,

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.961 align:middle line:84%
for example, a guy
comes up to you,

00:25:32.961 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and he really shouldn't
be talking to you.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's all nervous,
and he's looking around.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling you
something that he shouldn't.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Did something like
that ever happen?

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.109 align:middle line:84%
Or was it so locked down
that it was impossible?

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, after being
in there over many years,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.990 align:middle line:90%
people do start to open up.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:90%
We start knowing, OK.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.100 align:middle line:84%
This person has
been here this long.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:84%
They obviously are not going
to say the wrong thing.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll be able
to hold a secret.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're still not allowed
to fraternize with anybody

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:04.526 align:middle line:90%
from any--

00:26:04.526 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:84%
you can't be a
friend of someone.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.290 align:middle line:84%
You can't date
someone in this lab.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.134 align:middle line:90%
It's really that strict.

00:26:11.134 --> 00:26:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, Emery, I really
want to thank you for what

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.930 align:middle line:90%
you're doing here.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The promise of where this
technology can take us

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.270 align:middle line:84%
as a world I think makes
it worth it for both of us

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.729 align:middle line:84%
to put our lives on
the line for this show.

00:26:22.729 --> 00:26:24.270 align:middle line:84%

you for watching.
