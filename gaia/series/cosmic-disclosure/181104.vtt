>> GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host George Noory,
and I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.967 align:middle line:84%
Portal technologies, are
they natural or man-made?

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:29.425 align:middle line:84%
Emery, welcome back
to the program.

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.508 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH: Well,
thanks for having me George.

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You do a remarkable
job investigating some of these

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:84%
very strange and unusual
things, like portals.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Well, there's
many different terminology

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:10%
definitions we can get into,
but first let's talk about

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.272 align:middle line:10%
the different kinds of portals.

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:45.071 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: OK.

00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Because there's
portals all over the world

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and all over this planet,
even in the oceans,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that have been studied
for a long time.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:84%
There's ancient portals
that have been built here

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:84%
by ancient civilizations
that have been

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.390 align:middle line:90%
here long before we were here.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened is, when
these classified projects find

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
these energy signatures
on the planet,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
they usually go
towards these areas

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and set up bases near them
to monitor how they work,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and what's coming in and
out of them, if anything,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and measuring why are they
in these areas of the planet?

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these are on
ley lines and on sacred sites

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:84%
that people already know
about here on planet Earth.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is
they'll find an area,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and they'll go to this
area, study it for a while,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:90%
then maybe set up a base nearby.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And if they can, they'll try
to reverse-engineer this portal

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
technology, either
near the same--

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
one of these Earth portals
that have been there forever,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:90%
built by ancient civilizations.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Or they will put it right
directly on top of the site,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and build a base right on top
of this, and harvest that energy

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
as well, and keep
it for themselves

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.885 align:middle line:84%
and study it as a
laboratory environment.

00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Are there any portals
that are natural to the planet,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:84%
or are they all man-made
by some civilization?

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: There are areas of
the planet that you don't see

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:84%
a pyramid, or a Stonehenge,
or anything like that,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.830 align:middle line:84%
but it's just this area has
the ability to basically

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.740 align:middle line:90%
teletransport people and things.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And craft will come in and out
of these things every so often,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
activated all the time.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
The planet has to be in a
certain rotation and axis,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and the astrology
behind it, also

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:84%
with the universe all has to be
in alignment first, sometimes

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:90%
for these things to happen.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So they try to find these
areas and they mark them down,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:90%
they study them.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
They usually build an
Indian reservation on it,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
or a base to protect it, or
buy the land up and classify it

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:84%
as government land,
and things like this.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Is it possible
you can go into a portal,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.585 align:middle line:90%
but you can't come back?

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well,
that's the problem.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.450 align:middle line:84%
We do have man-made portals,
and the technology behind that

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:84%
just has not really
been perfected so well.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:90%
And this can happen.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a very delicate
thing you're working with.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're kind of working
with a little bit of time

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.375 align:middle line:90%
distortion--

00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:15.175 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Sure.

00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: -- or you're working
with basically breaking down

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
your atomic structure, and
putting it somewhere else

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.902 align:middle line:84%
pretty quickly, walking
through these things.

00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And there is a change that
happens to your body which

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.910 align:middle line:84%
you don't actually
feel or realize,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
it's not like in
the movie "Contact,"

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.860 align:middle line:84%
where Jodie Foster sees all
these crazy lights and meteors

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of instantaneous.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:84%
The movies really
elaborate on it too much.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:90%
There's not this bright light.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty clear, actually.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:84%
It looks like you're looking
through some plexiglass.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:84%
It's very blurry like you
said, maybe wavy like that.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's a distortion
sometimes, not all the time,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually see, and
you're walking through that.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So if there was a portal a few
inches wide between you and I,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:84%
you would just seem
a little blurry,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:84%
but you could still see me,
and I could still see you.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:84%
But if I went
through that, that's

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:90%
a whole rip in time and space.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.245 align:middle line:84%
So I'd be at the exit point
of that specific portal.

00:04:15.245 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Would you disappear?

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I would literally
disappear right in front

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.480 align:middle line:90%
of you.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
You would actually see me bleed
into the space around you.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
You would see a distortion,
usually, of some sort

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
as the person or, you know,
the device, or the aircraft,

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:84%
or whatever is
permeating through this.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's instantaneous.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like it's
just dissolving on itself.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I hate to bring this up,
but kind of like when

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:90%
the planes hit the 9/11 towers.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.865 align:middle line:84%
They just dissolved
into a flat spot.

00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's like that, you're
just going through,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:90%
and then you're gone.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's not any bright
lights, or anything like that.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk through
these types of portals,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:84%
you don't feel too
much of anything

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.300 align:middle line:84%
except maybe a pressure
change, usually.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I always had some
sinus issues with it.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I can feel my
pressure in my eyes,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and ears, and in my
sinuses kind of pop.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: When you walk
through, Emery, what's there?

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: One of the
ones I can talk about,

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:84%
it's an underground
facility in New Mexico,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:84%
is they had built a frame,
like a picture frame,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:90%
out of the ground.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's anywhere from
15 to 30 feet wide,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.270 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they
have many of these.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're about
three feet wide

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
of this metal, that's wide,
that goes all the way up

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:84%
in the air about 10 or 20
feet, and then comes over

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:90%
and goes down.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.821 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a square, but
there's no bottom frame.

00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:41.695 align:middle line:84%
Just on the sides you
see this really thick--

00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:42.778 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Like a doorway.

00:05:42.778 --> 00:05:44.954 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Right,
like a giant doorway.

00:05:44.954 --> 00:05:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
are underground.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Some of these are in
hangars, like giant buildings

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:90%
above the ground.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And they create this
electromagnetic flux field,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.170 align:middle line:90%
and then there's this line.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very large building,
very large area, usually.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is not in
that area, by the way,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:84%
they have people up
higher, three floors up

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:84%
with windows, the
control center,

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and all of the safety people
and all that stuff's there.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's big enough that they
can fly, inside these buildings

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.162 align:middle line:84%
they can fly drones,
like the big drones

00:06:17.162 --> 00:06:18.120 align:middle line:90%
you see as big as cars.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Sure.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So get a picture of
a very large facility that has

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:90%
a quarter-mile stretch inside.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And they can fly these
drones into the portals,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and program them
to fly back out.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And they can also send small
robots in and things like this.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So they've been studying this
for a very, very long time.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And not always are
they successful

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:90%
when they send a team through.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And just like, you
know, it's a big risk.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Just like astronauts take
the risk to go into space,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.267 align:middle line:90%
it's no different.

00:06:47.267 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:90%
And they're not there very long.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:84%
They're only they're usually
less than 30 minutes,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:84%
but there is a time gap, when
they do come back, for them.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.869 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: How do they go in?

00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:90%
And then how do they come back?

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.164 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, they fly
them right into the portals.

00:07:00.164 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
But they know what their
mission is, you know,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:90%
program life form type beings.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So they, it's no different
than how we walk through there.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:84%
These craft and these
cybernetic organisms

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:84%
have very special material
that they use made of,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's graphene and
some other special metals

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
from unearth origin that
they have mixed together--

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: The latest.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: That make it, right,
it's the lattice that forms

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.700 align:middle line:90%
around this.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:84%
It actually forms a small field
of energy around these things

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to protect them, so the
electromagnetic field

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:84%
doesn't fry the circuitry
and things like that.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: If you send a
drone in with a camera on it,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:84%
will you be able to see
anything on the other side?

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, yes.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:44.485 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Oh, that's amazing.

00:07:44.485 --> 00:07:45.385 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:07:45.385 --> 00:07:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Is there time
distortion when you enter

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:90%
a portal?

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, like
I said earlier,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:84%
when you're ripping a hole in
space and time to go somewhere

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.530 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously, we've noticed
we might be gone just 15

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.790 align:middle line:84%
minutes, we get back,
we've been gone 45 minutes.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Yeah.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Or a week, or a month.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.271 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, or
a week or a month.

00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So it definitely has something
to do with the time continuum.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.467 align:middle line:84%
And how that relates,
I'm not sure.

00:08:12.467 --> 00:08:14.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
many different types

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:84%
of portals that are out there
that go to different places.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to figure
out this highway of portals

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.105 align:middle line:84%
through the universe, they're
trying to map that now.

00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with a lot of
the ley lines of the universe.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.021 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of ley lines
that people don't understand

00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
that are not just here
on Earth, but they

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:84%
go from planet to planet, and
to solar system to solar system.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And these are energy highways
that extraterrestrials use,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.740 align:middle line:90%
and that we use--

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.505 align:middle line:84%
or are trying to use and learn,
to get us amongst the stars.

00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, people know
it ley lines are.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the sacred geometry
of the Earth, where

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
it seems to have a lot of
energy significance for ruins,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and archaeological sites,
and ancient history that

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.490 align:middle line:84%
involve extraterrestrials
and things like this.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:84%
They also have ways
to measure these ley

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:84%
lines around the
planet, to see where

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:90%
these energy vortexes are.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to
be always cornered

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:90%
on one of these ley line areas.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%
They have a map
of that, I think.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is, people
don't realize there's

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:90%
ley lines of the universe.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
There's ley lines in
our own solar system,

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.920 align:middle line:84%
kind of like we have
on Earth, that I

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
think ETs are using around the
whole universe to get around.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying
to map that out now

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.580 align:middle line:84%
by sending drones
in and all sorts

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.600 align:middle line:90%
of different types of devices.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I think the big
hexagon on Saturn,

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.510 align:middle line:84%
actually, is a giant
one of these portals

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:84%
that the extraterrestrials
used to go interdimensionally,

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.110 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.082 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Is it instant travel
when you go through a portal?

00:09:41.082 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: It's instantaneous.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So as you take that step
and finish this step,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
you're still there, but
you're just somewhere else.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Because we have sent ropes, and
cables, and all sorts of things

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
through that were
in both dimensions

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:90%
at the exact same time.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:84%
We were using that more for
equipment, and more for data

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:84%
collecting, and
things like that.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
When we go through
with the projects,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.260 align:middle line:84%
there's usually six
to seven people,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:84%
and there's these lines
about three feet wide,

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's about 100, 150
feet long, that goes

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:90%
through that picture frame.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And you have to stay inside
that sidewalk that's painted.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Because for some reason if
you don't hit it center,

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
just right, you could
actually lose a limb or die.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Really?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Because of the energy
flux fields that surround this

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.810 align:middle line:90%
unit, it's very, very strong.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
radiation that's

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:84%
associated with that on the
sides, but not in that walkway,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Minute amounts of radiation
that can harm you.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.735 align:middle line:84%
So as you walk through this,
you bleed into this area.

00:10:47.735 --> 00:10:48.535 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Mhm.

00:10:48.535 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And all the places
that I've went to, when you

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.590 align:middle line:84%
turn around, there was actually
another either ancient portal,

00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
like some sort of structure
mimicking that this is where we

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:90%
have to go back.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.277 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the exact
same structure,

00:11:05.277 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
but they have been
doing this a while,

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
where they're building
the exact same structure

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:84%
on the other ends of these
portals that only open up

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.895 align:middle line:90%
at certain specific times.

00:11:13.895 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And I assume they
close at specific times, too.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Correct.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Have you
gone through portals,

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.350 align:middle line:90%
and you got lost coming back?

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No, no.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I've been through
portals, but I've never

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:90%
had a problem coming back.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.520 align:middle line:84%
We were only there
for maybe 15 minutes

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:90%
collecting some samples.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I've never ventured far at
all from the actual gateway

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:84%
of coming in and
out the entrance

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.850 align:middle line:90%
and exit of the portal.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:10%
There has been
teams that have been

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:10%
gone for weeks at
a time, that have

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:10%
been doing amazing
investigations,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.490 align:middle line:10%
but I was not a part of that.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Gone for
weeks on purpose?

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But they have many, many
times, a team did not come back

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and they were confirmed
killed, very recently.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I was notified last January,
and they called me actually

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and asked if I
wanted to come back,

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.407 align:middle line:84%
and I said how's so
and so and so and so?

00:12:07.407 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:10%
And they said well, that's
why we need you to come back,

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:10%
we lost that team.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing it
since the early 90s.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:84%
This team has been
very successful,

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and they had a
glitch in the system,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
because it was an AI-based
mechanical, electrical

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
reverse-engineered
portal technology.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's not worth,
of course, for me

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.460 align:middle line:84%
right now to take
any type of position

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.706 align:middle line:84%
that there's a 50-50
mortality rate.

00:12:34.706 --> 00:12:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: That's too high.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.079 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: That's way too high.

00:12:37.079 --> 00:12:40.287 align:middle line:84%
But you know, not
for some people that

00:12:40.287 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
have been so successful
at it, they've

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.507 align:middle line:84%
been doing it for decades,
and then this happens.

00:12:44.507 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a tragedy, like
when the space shuttle blew up.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:50.614 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: So this team of how
many goes through a portal,

00:12:50.614 --> 00:12:51.530 align:middle line:90%
and then what happens?

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:90%
They can't find their way back?

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.330 align:middle line:90%
I think everything went fine.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:84%
They said they had a glitch with
the actual portal technology

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.680 align:middle line:84%
that we had designed, and
as they were coming back,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.550 align:middle line:90%
it killed them.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they use people
in the military, especially

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:84%
active duty, you might
have a son or daughter that

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:84%
is a field medic, or a supply
chain runner, you know?

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But all these people could be
deployed secretly in places,

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and they could die, and they get
a note from the military saying

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.741 align:middle line:90%
they died in the active--

00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Line of duty.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.906 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: -- war, in the
line of duty, and so forth.

00:13:32.906 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So most people don't realize
that a lot of these technicians

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and scientists are active
duty, because they're

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
the most expendable,
and they don't

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.780 align:middle line:90%
have to tell anyone anything.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:84%
They could just say
they hit an IED, or--

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Mhm, exactly.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Something
happened, an accident,

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:90%
and they don't have to explain.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
All they could say is, you
know, here's your $150,000.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Sorry that this
happened to your son.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And you'll never
know that your son

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.600 align:middle line:84%
was part of a space project, or
part of underground facility,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:84%
or part of a portal group
that was working on some

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.290 align:middle line:90%
of the most amazing things.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.835 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they hide it.

00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Do we have a team
in place that goes through

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.000 align:middle line:84%
portals, specifically
to look for lost people?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.470 align:middle line:84%
No, like I said,
anything that happens,

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that's why there's usually
a team of six or seven.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.930 align:middle line:10%
When they come back, if someone
had an accident or something,

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:10%
someone would report on that.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.220 align:middle line:10%
They don't leave anyone behind.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:37.670 align:middle line:10%
It's a very close-knit family
teamwork, a very adept amount

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:43.970 align:middle line:10%
of knowledge, even consciously,
scientifically as far

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:10%
as massive amounts
of intelligence,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.600 align:middle line:10%
high-IQ people that
are really in shape,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:10%
and just really
well-rounded human beings

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:10%
that are pioneers in discovery.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's addictive, too.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Emery, I'm fascinated
by what you said earlier about

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
these universal ley
lines and portals.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And I am convinced that
extraterrestrial craft,

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:84%
they come through these portals
or wormholes to get here.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, they're
using these energy highways.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But it all depends on the
type of extraterrestrial,

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and how conscious
they are, what's

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:84%
their level of
scientific technology.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
extraterrestrials

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
that have been here a
billion years before us

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that have already conquered
inter-dimensional travel, just

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:90%
by their own bodies.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.950 align:middle line:10%
And they have built these
craft that they go inside.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.990 align:middle line:10%
So as they're
traveling, the craft

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:10%
can create an electromagnetic
flux field in front of it,

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:10%
and can actually
form its own portal.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
They have mastered
a portable portal.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
The gravitational field goes
all the way around the craft.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
can make right hand

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.032 align:middle line:84%
turns at 90,000 miles
an hour, and no one

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:84%
goes flying towards the
window, because they're

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:90%
in their own field.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
By this type of technology,
they can open up time and space,

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:84%
go into it, and immediately
be somewhere else.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible they
could be using these ley

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:90%
lines to do that, as well.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Can you use these
ley lines or portals to get

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.070 align:middle line:84%
to specific places
throughout the universe?

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Could we go from Earth to
Jupiter, just like that?

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The only ones that I'm
aware of are the ones that only

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.110 align:middle line:84%
go to certain places that are
just a one-way, here and there.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
They are trying to
build the DeLorean,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and have it plug
it in, I want to go

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
to this spot at this time,
you know, in the universe.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes there.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
These portals open up
somehow, but they have not

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:90%
perfected that at all.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:90%
But there is some way to do it.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we are
working on overunity devices,

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
a field of energy
would form around us,

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:90%
and we could see things.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:90%
We could see different time--

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:90%
different types of time zones.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So there is a way, I
believe, that they're

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
going to conquer
very soon of, OK, we

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.630 align:middle line:84%
want to go back in
this amount of time

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:84%
to this area on Jupiter, and
they'll be able to do that.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Are there monuments
or structures on this planet

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
that are built near ley lines
and portals for specific

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:90%
reasons?

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, I do believe
that all these ancient ruins

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and these portals around the
planet were actually there

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:90%
to heal the earth.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I think it's an energetic
component of the Earth

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:84%
that the extraterrestrials
built, or helped us build,

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.220 align:middle line:84%
to protect the earth, actually,
in different times of chaos

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:84%
that's going on
within the Earth.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Which is, just like our
own bodies are trying

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.750 align:middle line:84%
to achieve
homeostasis, the earth

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.030 align:middle line:84%
is constantly trying to
achieve its homeostasis.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:10%
And I think all these ancient
sites, these sacred sites,

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.040 align:middle line:10%
have something to do with
keeping that in balance.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Is the military
involved in any of this, Emery?

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are they tapping
into this kind of technology?

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:16.400 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: The military are
usually just assigned to secure

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.410 align:middle line:10%
these areas, and
provide mostly security.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
But they have used
security details

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to come with the team for
safety, and things like that.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
They do always need a
paramedic, they always

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:84%
need a security guy, and the
rest are usually scientists.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
people, they're

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.887 align:middle line:84%
all trained in weapons and
first aid, and it's just--

00:18:43.887 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:90%
that's what you are.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
When you're part of a mission,
you're going into space,

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.007 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to pick people
that's going to go to Mars,

00:18:51.007 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
each person-- it's not
just going to be one person

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.150 align:middle line:84%
only knows how to fix an
engine, I'll tell you that much.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Everyone on that team is going
to be so well-versed in so

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.130 align:middle line:90%
many amazing things.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
they're looking for.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
these scientists

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:09.620 align:middle line:84%
out there that are
hard-core adventurous, that

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:84%
have not just one background,
but study everything.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Because you need that
in a team to survive

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.300 align:middle line:84%
extra-planetary visits,
or space travel.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:10%
>> GEORGE: What could a nation
do that understands the use

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:10%
of portals, in order to
manipulate the rest of this

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:10%
planet?

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I think what's
going on is there's only a few

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.460 align:middle line:84%
of these places around the
planet that's pretty much owned

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:90%
by the major corporations.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:84%
They're so scared
of this technology,

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:84%
since it's not mastered, that
right now what they're doing

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:84%
is just using these portals
to go into these areas,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:84%
bring back specimens of
plant life and minerals,

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and use that to
make products here,

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and to further advance
our technology,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and of course, further
advance their pocketbooks.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: So you literally can
go through a portal to another

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:84%
physical location,
and take things,

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:84%
if that location happens
to be in the right spot?

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Correct.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.559 align:middle line:84%
You can go in and
bring things back.

00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the mission is, like
one of the things we were doing

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.482 align:middle line:90%
is collecting plants.

00:20:11.482 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think I spoke about this
before, I won't get into it,

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:84%
but one of the plant
leaves was bulletproof.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So they were trying to find
the exoskeleton of this plant

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, how can we
replicate this into our suits?

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.154 align:middle line:84%
Our special suits
and things like this.

00:20:27.154 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
technology we have today

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:84%
actually came not only
from reverse-engineered

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial downed
craft and extraterrestrials,

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.080 align:middle line:84%
but came from these
missions that they

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.205 align:middle line:90%
were doing in portals.

00:20:37.205 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Do these portals
go to other universes,

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:84%
or other areas
within our universe?

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, they
can go anywhere.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.210 align:middle line:84%
The ones that I am
directly involved with only

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.610 align:middle line:84%
went to one specific location
within this universe.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
exactly where that is.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I just know that I
could breathe the air,

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.680 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of the
same temperature,

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.060 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing different
except the way the dirt looked,

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:90%
the way the plant life looked.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Some of the small marsupials
and small insects,

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.730 align:middle line:90%
I've never actually saw a being.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.200 align:middle line:10%
But I have seen videos
of past-portal--

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:10%
everyone has cameras
on them, by the way.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I have seen videos of
people meeting beings

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:90%
on different planets.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they were
there waiting when teams

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:90%
went through 15, 20 years ago.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So there is definitely
something they're using it for,

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
but I was not at a
classification security

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.050 align:middle line:84%
to know or ask about
it, because you have

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:90%
to go through certain training.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:37.900 align:middle line:90%
It's just like before--

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:84%
active duty members, when
they get deployed somewhere,

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:84%
we have a good day or
two to learn the customs

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:84%
of what country we're
going to, or what we could

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:90%
involve-- it's the same thing.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
We get to know this is
what you're looking for,

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.850 align:middle line:84%
the type of rocks,
types of plants.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:84%
This is how we're
going to collect them.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.297 align:middle line:10%
These are the species that are
there, so don't be alarmed.

00:21:58.297 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were able to see a
lot of different missions, way

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.421 align:middle line:84%
before we go there,
that have already

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:05.154 align:middle line:90%
been done in the same spot.

00:22:05.154 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Emery, how were
portals discovered in the first

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.202 align:middle line:84%
place, and what were
they looking for?

00:22:10.202 --> 00:22:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, the best way I
can-- my own opinion on that,

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:84%
just from all the stuff I've
read and been exposed to, is

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:84%
that they first had these
special types of satellites

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:84%
that picked up on subtle
fluctuations of energy in many

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
different types of
fields of energy.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And they notice hot
spots around the planet,

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and they would go and
investigate these hot spots.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Send teams, maybe send even
military craft and ships

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:84%
out there, and see
what was going on,

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and figure out why
these areas have

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:84%
these huge electromagnetic flux
fields, and all these vortexes

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were, like I said,
using types of technology

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm not familiar with.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So they were there
locating them,

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and then going to
investigate, and that's

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.840 align:middle line:84%
how they were finding
some of these ones

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't
already know about,

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.964 align:middle line:84%
such as the pyramids
and Stonehenge.

00:22:58.964 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Were they in shock
when they found these spots?

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I think it was
like a learning thing.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:90%
It's always a new discovery.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It's happening every day,
we discover new things

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.780 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, and
the secret projects.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And it is a mind-blowing thing,
I think, for the scientists

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and for the corporations
to figure something out,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:90%
and to find out what's going on.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we really
don't know that much,

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:84%
because we're using our five
senses here on planet Earth,

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot more than
the five senses going on

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.700 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, and
around the universe.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What's the difference
between natural portals,

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and portals that
are made by man,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:90%
or an extraterrestrial race?

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Natural portals
use the energy of the planet,

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.445 align:middle line:84%
and all the planets, and these
ley lines universally that I

00:23:45.445 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:90%
was talking about.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:84%
When they make an artificial,
reverse-engineered portal,

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.207 align:middle line:84%
they're powering it with
their own power supply.

00:23:52.207 --> 00:23:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they would like to
build it near the ley lines

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and somehow tap into that,
or build on top of a natural

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:90%
made portal, you know?

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying to
mimic these energy flux

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:84%
fields at a certain rate, to
create the exact same thing.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So one is man-made, and
one is completely natural.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Is it easy to make
them with today's technology?

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.662 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Absolutely not.

00:24:16.662 --> 00:24:17.495 align:middle line:90%
It's very difficult.

00:24:17.495 --> 00:24:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: That's
what I thought.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: We're a bunch
of, we're not at that level

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:21.900 align:middle line:90%
of intelligence yet.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.025 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What's the
difference between a stargate

00:24:24.025 --> 00:24:24.870 align:middle line:90%
and a portal?

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, stargates are
more like pop culture terms

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:84%
that you see for the
movies and TV shows.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.920 align:middle line:84%
That's just another
term for a portal,

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.250 align:middle line:84%
or an inter-dimensional
highway, or

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:38.280 align:middle line:84%
a trans-dimensional ancient
ruin that can get you somewhere.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just another term for
that, so we don't use that term.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Basically all one
in the same, aren't they?

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Are we using
portals right now?

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The last I've heard
and been debriefed on is

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:84%
they're still using portals to
collect data of different areas

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.300 align:middle line:84%
of the planet and other planets,
and also bringing back samples

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
to reverse engineer different
types of metal, and plant life,

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:90%
and genetic DNA.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.260 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing back
all sorts of things.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.468 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Is there a
nefarious reason for this, too?

00:25:09.468 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Not that I'm aware of.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, this is more
used for reverse engineering,

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
creating better
products to sell,

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.310 align:middle line:90%
creating better pharmaceuticals.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.860 align:middle line:84%
With that, I would always
assume that there could

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.069 align:middle line:90%
be a negative aspect of that.

00:25:24.069 --> 00:25:25.693 align:middle line:84%
If you're making
something good, you're

00:25:25.693 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:84%
also gonna be making something
bad, or something to protect

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:84%
something that
shouldn't be protected.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:90%
So I'm sure there's--

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:90%
it goes both ways.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.030 align:middle line:84%
A good and bad balance of many
different types of technologies

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:36.960 align:middle line:90%
come out of this.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Who's mapping the
portals, and how do they do it?

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, there's
a number of institutions

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and organizations out there,
and corporations that are

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.400 align:middle line:84%
in control of these portals
from around the planet.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And what they're doing is
using drones and other things

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:56.100 align:middle line:84%
to look at the stars, at
these different other areas,

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and mapping where
it's coming from.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So they could, let's
say go through a portal,

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.260 align:middle line:84%
be on another planet,
look up at the sky,

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.590 align:middle line:84%
see the different star systems,
locate our star systems,

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and then draw a line
from there to there.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.161 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of archaic,
but this is kind of,

00:26:12.161 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:84%
from what I understand,
is how they're doing it.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.195 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Are there
portal mapmakers?

00:26:16.195 --> 00:26:19.319 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, no, I think
it's just part of that project.

00:26:19.319 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:84%
It's always, no matter if
you're going somewhere,

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.630 align:middle line:84%
you're still going to be always
mapping, taking readings,

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:26.275 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:26:26.275 --> 00:26:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Emery, there's got to
be other portals on this planet

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that have been used
by, I would believe,

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:37.350 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial races, or other
civilizations for their own

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:90%
purposes.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Aren't there?

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, sure.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of these energy
fluctuations that they've

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.320 align:middle line:84%
marked on the satellites, and
when they go to investigate,

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.640 align:middle line:84%
they kind of just sit back a
mile or two, or even closer,

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and visualize, even in
a 3D, these craft coming

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.840 align:middle line:84%
through, and measuring all sorts
of different types of energies.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.116 align:middle line:90%
And yes, so absolutely.

00:27:00.116 --> 00:27:01.740 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely
craft coming through

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.180 align:middle line:84%
that they're monitoring,
and seeing what's happening,

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and trying to track
those craft, of course.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.902 align:middle line:84%
But they're not shooting
them down or anything.

00:27:10.902 --> 00:27:12.360 align:middle line:84%
As far as I know,
there hasn't been

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.290 align:middle line:84%
any type of attack or something
from one of these craft.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.110 align:middle line:84%
You probably wouldn't be
able to, I don't think,

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:84%
even destroy one of these
craft, because they've already

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:84%
conquered
inter-dimensional travel.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.222 align:middle line:84%
They could just be fluxing
in and out of this frequency

00:27:27.222 --> 00:27:28.638 align:middle line:84%
when they come
through the portal,

00:27:28.638 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and if you shoot
a torpedo at it,

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.476 align:middle line:84%
it would just go
right through it.

00:27:31.476 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Are there some
creatures on, let's say,

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Zeta Reticuli, that look
at a portal and they say,

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.100 align:middle line:90%
that's the path to earth.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this one.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I believe in
other underground facilities

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrial bases
located within earth,

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that they're using that type of
technology to come in and out,

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.010 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.540 align:middle line:84%
They definitely wouldn't
be using a spacecraft.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Spiritually
speaking, are those portals that

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:84%
we've heard about during the
ancient times the same as what

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.706 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about today?

00:28:00.706 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, I think looking
back at all the ancient text

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and things, there's a lot of
correlation to the stories

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.220 align:middle line:84%
behind portal technologies
and things like that,

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.190 align:middle line:84%
where people would just appear,
or craft would just appear out

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.120 align:middle line:90%
of nowhere.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were probably
witnessing this type

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.365 align:middle line:90%
of technology back then.

00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Emery, how did the
ancients come across portals?

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they didn't create any,
they didn't have the technology

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.341 align:middle line:90%
Who did?

00:28:26.341 --> 00:28:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well,
when I say ancients,

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I do mean ancient
extraterrestrial

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:90%
civilizations--

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Aha.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: -- that helped
humans at one point, too.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But even before, way before
that, even some of their craft

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:41.250 align:middle line:84%
had been crashed and
dislodged in the ice,

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and dislodged in caverns, and
even within the Earth itself.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And they have these, like I
said, portable portals already

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.455 align:middle line:84%
still running on the craft
for thousands of years,

00:28:52.455 --> 00:28:53.255 align:middle line:90%
even to this day.

00:28:53.255 --> 00:28:55.838 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: So they've been using
that for that long, at least.

00:28:55.838 --> 00:28:56.905 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right, correct.

00:28:56.905 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: If you were asked
today to go through a portal

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:90%
on some mission, would you go?

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Probably not,
because I'm still--

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.030 align:middle line:84%
it'd be a good way to
get rid of me right now.

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And I've been turning
down so many contract

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.456 align:middle line:90%
jobs because of this.

00:29:12.456 --> 00:29:14.871 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You think they would
do this to get rid of you?

00:29:14.871 --> 00:29:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well,
accidents happen.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And right now, I need
to be here on Earth.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I need to be helping
people understand what's

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.340 align:middle line:84%
going on, sharing the
knowledge with people

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.160 align:middle line:90%
like you to get it out there.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Because me leaving
the planet right now

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.870 align:middle line:84%
is not going to help the planet,
and I gotta help the planet,

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.895 align:middle line:84%
and I gotta help
everyone here first.

00:29:35.895 --> 00:29:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: I've never
seen you scared before.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm picking up a feeling of
somebody is out to get you.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: That's always
in the background.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's always going to
happen when you come forward.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.100 align:middle line:84%
There's-- the threats have
gone down considerably since

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.350 align:middle line:90%
I've came forward.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about the
sensitive subjects anymore--

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.510 align:middle line:84%
overunity and regenerative
medicine so much.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.472 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where
the threats come from.

00:30:02.472 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:84%
The government does
not care that I

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.570 align:middle line:84%
talk about ETs, because there's
no money being made in ETs.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But when I start teaching
people the physics of overunity,

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:84%
or talking about cellular
biology that can help heal you

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.390 align:middle line:84%
so you don't need
pharmaceuticals,

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.370 align:middle line:90%
then I'm stepping on the toes.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So you gotta be careful
with these things.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And I had a whole life of
threats, ever since CSETI,

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.880 align:middle line:84%
since I got involved with
CSETI and then after that,

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.007 align:middle line:84%
with the overunity lab
that I had, and then

00:30:29.007 --> 00:30:30.840 align:middle line:84%
of course recently, the
last two years, it's

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:90%
been pretty horrible.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.170 align:middle line:10%
But life is getting a
lot better for me now.

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I have great organizations
and corporations contacting

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.090 align:middle line:84%
me that want to do
the right thing,

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:84%
are not interested in the money,
or the control over the people.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think the world,
and all the listeners

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:84%
are having a really good
impact on the planet

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.990 align:middle line:84%
by talking about this
more freely and open,

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and finding out
about the cures that

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:59.010 align:middle line:84%
are out there that I talk about,
and researching these things.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Yeah of course, I would like to
take the next ship out of here.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back
amongst the stars.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back
to my roots, and be

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.760 align:middle line:84%
the explorer of these
places, but I don't think

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.940 align:middle line:90%
it's right to abandon--

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I really, really
love this planet,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.020 align:middle line:90%
and it deserves a chance.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do my best
to get these technologies out

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:24.180 align:middle line:90%
to help clean up the planet.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And with the help
of all my listeners,

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and people backing me up
and standing behind me,

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I think this is going to be done
in a very short period of time.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Because people are going
to start listening more,

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and other countries are wanting
to get involved with this.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So bringing everyone together,
and putting all the other ego

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:48.084 align:middle line:84%
stuff to the side of
religion, and war, and racism,

00:31:48.084 --> 00:31:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and all this, I
think that's going

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.780 align:middle line:84%
to be a big catalyst for us
to go in the right direction

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:55.950 align:middle line:90%
to help the planet.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And then we can help each other.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And once I know that everyone is
in a homeostasis kind of state,

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.080 align:middle line:84%
including the earth,
well yeah, I'll

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.930 align:middle line:84%
probably take a trip
to that portal again.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.085 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Stay out of
portals right now, though.

00:32:08.085 --> 00:32:09.116 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: But right now.

00:32:09.116 --> 00:32:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Thanks, Emery,
for being on the program.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.555 align:middle line:84%
This is "Cosmic Disclosure,"
thank you for watching.

season on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.650 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:23.840 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.340 align:middle line:10%
and secret space programs.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It's easier,
actually, to build another world

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:84%
in the earth, than it is to fix
the earth we have right now,

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.140 align:middle line:84%
with our atmosphere and
everything that we're doing

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:33.940 align:middle line:90%
to it.

a bit.
