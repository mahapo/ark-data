>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:10%
we're at an undisclosed
location with Tim.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.360 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.888 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.888 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you for having me.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We understand our
history in a linear fashion.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
How do the ETs
you have contacted

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:90%
recall our human history?

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Interestingly, they
totally look differently

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:90%
upon the history of humankind.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And this was something that
I found really interesting,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:84%
because I was thinking that
communicating with beings that

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.760 align:middle line:84%
have so much knowledge
and even found

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:84%
a way to store their
knowledge over star systems

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.700 align:middle line:90%
like the Greys where every--

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
all the insular information
are connected to each other

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and been given over millions
of light years very quickly.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised to find out
that different species have

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
different stories
about human history.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And also, I mean, history has
been rewritten so many times

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
that there might also
be some confusion.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And we also have to deal with
the effect of failed timelines,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:84%
which is a naturally occurring
physical effect in the universe

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.680 align:middle line:84%
that we have a time strain
in the middle of everything

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that is a stable and successful
evolvement of the universe.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And once other strains
or lines are explored,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
there are always
fading timelines.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:84%
When someone moves into
an unstable timeline

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and it gets failed because
of self-destructive behavior,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.260 align:middle line:84%
of random occurring
incidents, or just

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:84%
because the consciousness
units decides

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
to go back to a certain
place and just leave

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:84%
what they just explored, then
you have a failed timeline.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And all those failed
timelines get reintegrated

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
into the successful
main time strain,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty positive.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is
making like a backup plan

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
so that everything
will turn out right.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Because once a version or a
parallel version of yourself

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:84%
failed, you probably
didn't even notice that,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
because the observer stays
inside of the successful line.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that dying is
the same as a failed timeline.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
A failed timeline just means
that memory gets reintegrated

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
into the successful
main time strain.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And because everything
is in real time

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
moving fluently,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.908 align:middle line:84%
an observer might
not even notice that.

00:03:37.908 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Having defined
these ground rules,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.980 align:middle line:84%
can you offer some
examples about our history

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
according to the ETs
you've talked to?

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, yeah, interesting.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So the perspective, for
example, of Being 6,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:84%
which is a Level
6 consciousness,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:90%
being outside of dimension.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So what they think about
human history is super exotic.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:84%
They see everything
as source with kind

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:84%
of probabilities that
create systems in which life

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:90%
can be experienced.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And they are saying
that everything

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:84%
we're experiencing right now is
a very, very old, old thought

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.415 align:middle line:84%
that comes from
the source itself.

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of makes sense.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an apple and
you're looking at the apple,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
the information that
comes back to you

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
is not the present
information, because it

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
takes some time inside of time
to get the information back.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:84%
The light from the
moon takes one second

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and the light from
the sun to the Earth

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:84%
is about eight
minutes away from us.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So everything we see
is just a past version

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:90%
of what we're looking at.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So the distance between
our sun and the Earth

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:84%
is very small compared to the
overall size of the universe.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that when you
zoom out of time, which

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
this being does, it
looks upon everything

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:90%
from an outside perspective.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And they realize that what
we actually are looking upon

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:90%
is a very old, ancient thought.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:44.290 align:middle line:84%
They have that idea that
every sun is a direct portal

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:90%
to source itself.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:84%
What they see is a huge
field of light in which

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:90%
there are some dark spots.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And those dark spots
have some controversy,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
something to explore
inside of source itself.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Source itself experiences
itself and explores itself.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So what they say
about history is

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that source was curious
what it's like to be here.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And from that
perspective-- and again,

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:84%
this is their perspective, and
it's totally different to other

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:90%
stories we've heard--

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:84%
they have placed the
pyramid exactly where

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Giza is, because that is also
the coordinates of the speed

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:84%
of light exactly on the
top of the pyramid in order

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:84%
to split light and
the thought that we

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.350 align:middle line:90%
are experiencing right here.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And through that process of
building that pyramid there,

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:84%
without even having humans in
existence and on this planet,

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:90%
source could observe itself.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason
from that perspective why

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:84%
we see this all-seeing eye
everywhere on the pyramid,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.920 align:middle line:84%
because that kind of was the
way the technology that source

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and Being 6 used in
order to observe itself.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What
examples in history

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
can you share from
the ET perspective?

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the Grey master line
has a very different approach

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to reality and what's
happening, because they

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:41.010 align:middle line:84%
perceive the universe as a
mental and cognitive concept.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
They also think it's
a very old thought.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.430 align:middle line:84%
But from their
perspective, they have

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:84%
thought that thought and
brought it into existence.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And because they
experienced this factor

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:84%
of being so isolated and
alone in the universe,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:84%
because there is no
actual you, there's

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:84%
no actual me, from that
perspective it's just empty.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And the universe is
so alone and so sad

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:17.460 align:middle line:84%
that they actually committed
some kind of suicide

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.060 align:middle line:84%
in order to create
another thought where

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:90%
they have a reason to be.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is their master
line getting erased.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So they created this
reality from their history--

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.789 align:middle line:84%
and you see, history is
totally different from species

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:90%
to species--

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
in order to experience
togetherness and maybe

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to exchange
and to experience diversity.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:84%
From their perspective it's that
they have built the second two

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.920 align:middle line:84%
pyramids that we find in Egypt
that are aligned to Orion,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:84%
which is also the material
universal headquarters

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:90%
of the Greys at some point.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:84%
We we're talking about
these Zeta Reticuli.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:84%
This is some-- there's a
planet inside of the star

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.110 align:middle line:90%
system of Orion.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:90%
They've built those pyramids.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.650 align:middle line:90%
They align to Orion.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Humans, which they
have created from apes,

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
could go inside of
the pyramid, get rid

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
of their biological
being, their body,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and get transported into
the system of the Greys.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And then reach out
back to humanity

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and also get integrated
into this community of Greys

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:84%
in order to explore
the universe and also

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:84%
to benefit from the
spirituality from human beings.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So the main ingredient
in humans is bonobo DNA.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.320 align:middle line:90%
So bonobos are very social--

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:90%
a very socializing species.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Probably one of the most--

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
they have the most
socializing group dynamics

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:84%
within all of the
monkeys and apes.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys totally
benefit from that,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:90%
and that is their story.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You just shared with
us some significant historical

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:84%
information, which
is that the Greys are

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:84%
responsible for creating
humanity from apes.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Is it with their own DNA or
with the DNA from other beings?

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It is the
Greys that claim

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:90%
to be the fathers of humanity.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I've already raised
that question,

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:84%
if this is the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:84%
because from now, from
our standpoint now,

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
we know that there are
several species that

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:19.430 align:middle line:84%
have created or manipulated
the human species.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's
something that falls

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
under this alternative reality
thing and parallel timelines

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.660 align:middle line:90%
getting connected.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's their firm
belief that they

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:90%
are the fathers of humanity.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And I know other
species are saying, no.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:90%
We did that.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
The Being 6, they are
claiming that they

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:56.700 align:middle line:84%
use all these perfectly
mathematical statues that you

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:84%
can find in Giza in
order to create humans,

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:84%
in order to have
movable consciousness

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
units to experience
what's happening

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:84%
inside this version
of the universe.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So there are many, many,
many different versions

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
of the same history, or maybe
it's not the same history.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:84%
At this point where we are,
we find an aligned strain

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:84%
of history, and we find
evidence for everything

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:90%
I've just told you.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But it just doesn't seem to be
a linear history to humanity.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who created
the pyramids, Tim?

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:90%
According to the Greys.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: According to the history
of the Greys, they don't know.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.980 align:middle line:84%
They found a system
where there was already

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.530 align:middle line:90%
a pyramid, the pyramid of Giza.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:84%
They found-- they
created humans from apes

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and also placed them at
different spots in the world.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:84%
They were talking about India as
one of the original spots where

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:90%
people come from.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And they brought
parts of their system

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:84%
onto Earth, which is especially
economical systems and also

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:90%
elite systems.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And through that, they expanded
their system more and more

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.610 align:middle line:90%
over the Earth.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And it happens to be something
disastrous happened in Egypt

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
to their history, which
means that the area

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:84%
around the pyramids weren't
a desert in the first place.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Something bad happened there.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Species that were
genetically modified

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:84%
became warrior-type
species, got into war,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.885 align:middle line:90%
and something bad happened then.

00:14:08.885 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Then we had the flood.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And to extract some
of the material

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:84%
the Greys placed there, they had
those two other pyramids built

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.040 align:middle line:84%
in order to use the benefits
of the first pyramid

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and to extract the souls of
those humans that were living

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:31.700 align:middle line:84%
there, and in order to bring
them to the Orion star system,

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and to integrate them
into their community.

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%
That is what the Greys say.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there another
historical perspective

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
about the pyramids
from other beings?

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:84%
There are beings inside of Being
6 that we were talking about,

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's one of
the reasons why we could call

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.360 align:middle line:84%
it Galactic Federation,
because they sometimes

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.820 align:middle line:90%
call themselves this way.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they do it in order

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
people or if they really

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:90%
name themselves this way.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But from their
perspective, there

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:90%
were already humans on Earth.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.300 align:middle line:90%
The pyramid was used--

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:25.270 align:middle line:84%
or let me say they gave
technology to those beings,

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.560 align:middle line:90%
to those humans.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing that
because humans at that time

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:84%
were spiritually and open-minded
enough to accept influences

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:90%
from outside.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:84%
They were basically not very
far advanced in technology,

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.030 align:middle line:84%
but they were
spiritually evolved

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:90%
enough to contact other beings.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How old would
you say the pyramids are?

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So according
to them, they

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:84%
are timeless, outside of time,
which means they have no time.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:09.150 align:middle line:84%
They are information
that appears pretty old,

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.031 align:middle line:90%
but they aren't.

00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:14.580 align:middle line:90%
They just have no time to them.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:84%
But inside of time, we probably
are talking about 15,000 years

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:84%
at least, because
that is the time when

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:90%
this catalyst was happening.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Whatever was before that
time, at least I don't know.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do ETs say about
the purpose of the pyramids?

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Are they still active today?

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: According
to Being 6, again,

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.380 align:middle line:84%
which is a being outside of
time, outside of dimensions,

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:84%
which has a different
view on everything,

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.490 align:middle line:84%
the original purpose
of the pyramid

00:16:53.490 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:84%
placed there was to
split light in a way

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.020 align:middle line:84%
so that source could
observe itself.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:84%
That is why the pyramid
of Giza was actually

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:17.099 align:middle line:84%
created outside of time and
outside of the dimension.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Some things-- I'm not sure of
everything-- but some things

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:27.210 align:middle line:84%
have an equivalent in
time and outside of time.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And according to them,
the pyramid in Giza

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:84%
has an equivalent
outside of time.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
The Greys were
using the pyramids

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to orient them to
the Orion star system

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and in order to bring out
humans to their system.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what they used it for.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
That is why they are
aligned to Orion.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And we also find different
space portals or at least

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:84%
sites all across the globe
that are in alignment

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.430 align:middle line:90%
with Orion star system.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
That is where the Greys took
all their material, which

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:84%
they called humans that
are willing to be extracted

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:84%
to their system and to
their net of collectiveness

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:90%
and collective memory.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the one purpose that
the Greys were speaking about.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Other beings-- and I think
they are called Arcturians.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:84%
It's been a long
time, and I'm not

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
very good at those
pop cultural names.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.890 align:middle line:84%
But there are beings that are
claiming that the pyramids have

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.940 align:middle line:90%
more than two chambers.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramid of Giza has
more than two chambers,

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and it has a lot more
functions than just one.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that it was
surely not and never has been

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:90%
is a tomb.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.410 align:middle line:90%
It's never been used as a tomb.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
pretty much proven,

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
because when they
found the pyramid,

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:84%
they were using TNT
in order to break up

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.230 align:middle line:90%
the doors and the entrances.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And they found those
containers which they refer to

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:84%
as sarcophagus, but there has
never, ever been a human body

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:90%
inside of that.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.950 align:middle line:84%
According to those
species, there

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:84%
are several more chambers
inside of the pyramid of Giza.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
They were used for
healing purposes,

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:84%
as well as in Mexico where
they have those pyramids which

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
can be accessed by a
whole group of people,

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:84%
whereas the pyramid in
Egypt, the Giza pyramid,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:90%
was used individually.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And those chambers were
used for healing purposes.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
They were also used to introduce
people to spiritual awakening

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:90%
feelings.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:84%
They were also used for
communication purposes.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
They also used some kind
of natural occurring energy

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:84%
in order to condense frequencies
so that higher frequential

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:84%
beings have a potential
to communicate

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:90%
with 3D bodies and 3D people.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were
storing memory there.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And they also, by the way they
were designed, were conducting

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.970 align:middle line:84%
electricity, because
what they told

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:84%
me is that in the original
version of the Giza pyramid,

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:84%
you have a basement of
some kind of material

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle line:90%
that conducts energy.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:84%
You have a so-called permidium
in the top that is either

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:90%
the plus or the minus pole.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anymore.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And you have a neutral
part in the midst.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And over that, there was some
very bright, shining chalk

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.000 align:middle line:90%
cover.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And through that, you
have a natural kind

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:84%
of electricity and conduction
system built into the pyramid.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So people who are arguing
possibly about, what's

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:84%
the function to
the pyramid, there

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.608 align:middle line:84%
seem to be a lot of functions,
at least to the Giza pyramids.

00:21:37.608 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
still active today?

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Apparently,
there seems to have

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:45.480 align:middle line:84%
been some kind of polar
change of the magnetic field

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.620 align:middle line:84%
of the planet itself,
because at some time

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:55.950 align:middle line:84%
the alignment of the
planet was rotating.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.640 align:middle line:84%
People can see that
through exploring

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
the different levels
of stone and sand,

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:90%
and they find that there.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.760 align:middle line:90%
So A, that.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And B, they are
pretty much ruined.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:84%
On the top of the pyramid where
the so-called permidium should

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:27.330 align:middle line:84%
be, the materials should
be conducting electricity,

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:90%
and it's been stolen.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Because at some point,
they used gold for that.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:84%
They didn't do that in
the original version.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:84%
They used some other
material, which

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I do not know what
it was right now,

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:90%
but then used something else.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And then later on
they put gold on it,

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:90%
and that got removed and stolen.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So that is something that is
problematic to the function

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.760 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramids.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:84%
But as it's been
said to me, they

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:07.320 align:middle line:84%
are still active and still
doing some kind of function.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How can you
explain the sacred geometry

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.890 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramids?

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: They are a
geometrical form,

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:84%
which means that
they alter the way

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:84%
the natural geometrical
flow of energy is curving.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:84%
This was one of the
first purposes for them

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
in order to break off,
to split off light

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.865 align:middle line:84%
so the source kind of
experiences itself.

00:23:35.865 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:90%
You know remember the eye?

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And they are still doing that.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Every pyramidal
structure everywhere,

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.220 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter which
size, they always

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:84%
alter the way the geometrical
flow of energy is going.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's what they still do.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:58.300 align:middle line:84%
They are still a point of
high-frequential energy

00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So Tim, would you
say the extraterrestrials

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
helped influence, stop,
or sabotage World War II?

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:84%
In what way were the
ETs an influence?

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: We know that
there was at least

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:17.650 align:middle line:84%
a high-frequential
observation of what's

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:84%
going on in the world
at World War II,

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:84%
because of course,
it was a catalyst

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and a high energetic
time at that time.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:84%
We also-- or at least it's
been said and assumed--

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:40.570 align:middle line:84%
that there was some kind of
sabotage on possibly both sides

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:84%
that made this war more
possible and entered into--

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:84%
resulted in that bad
ending that it became.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:25:00.710 align:middle line:84%
The reason why Greys or other
time-traveling species are not

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
going back and healing
that is because it's

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
relevant for the
evolution of the Earth.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.830 align:middle line:84%
We have, for example,
Germany that was going--

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:84%
so it wasn't basically
Germany, but the documents

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:84%
state that it's
especially Himmler

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and the SS that kind of was
the breakaway civilization

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.420 align:middle line:90%
from that time.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.780 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if
Hitler at some point

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.990 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what was
happening with all

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%
the SS and the
technology that the SS--

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.340 align:middle line:84%
they were basically doing
the same black budget

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.790 align:middle line:84%
stuff that happened
later on, and they

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:84%
were trying to shift all their
equipment down to Antarctica.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:84%
There's more and more
evidence to that.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And basically, we have a
still existing timeline

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:90%
with the Nazis from that time.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
There are still
influences and basically

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.620 align:middle line:84%
things that need to be
repaired, but they need

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:90%
to be repaired from inside.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.230 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot just go from
outside and make things not

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
happen, because then all the
timelines would get into chaos

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:90%
and confusion.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.890 align:middle line:84%
As strange as it
might seem or sound,

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Germans will at some
point play a role

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:84%
in the healing of the karma that
has happened in that time, just

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:84%
as much as a lot
of other nations

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:90%
will have to play their part.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So that is why you cannot go
and make World War II undone,

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.280 align:middle line:84%
even though a lot of other
wars that have happened and led

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:84%
to failed timelines do
not play a role anymore,

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:84%
because they officially didn't
appear on our timeline where

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.360 align:middle line:90%
we're on.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In the 1940s, we
have multiple UFO crash

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:25.250 align:middle line:90%
sites in North America.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.740 align:middle line:90%
What happened with those?

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: We are touching
that in another episode,

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:84%
but to my knowledge, especially
the Greys and another species,

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.360 align:middle line:84%
for example, which has
been called Ebens by the US

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:48.320 align:middle line:84%
military, and even some
other species as well,

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:84%
they were doing some
efforts in balancing out

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
technology advancement in
the history of the humans.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
We see that, for
example, regarding

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:84%
to the atomic bomb,
which firstly, I

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.570 align:middle line:84%
know this is
controversial, but there's

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:84%
a lot of evidence to that, that
the Germans were the ones who

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.190 align:middle line:84%
were pretty far advanced
in that program.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to bring
that down to Antarctica

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:84%
with special submarines
inside of the fueler convoy.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And some of them were
captured by US military ships

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.830 align:middle line:90%
and naval submarines and stuff.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is how the technology
then went to, I think,

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Los Alamos-- or where
was it invented?

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.670 align:middle line:90%
I think that's it.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And then used
against the Japanese.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.580 align:middle line:84%
After that, we find
that the atomic bomb is

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:59.640 align:middle line:84%
given to different, other
regions in the world,

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:90%
counterplay us.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And this pretty much was done so
you have a balanced world where

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.850 align:middle line:84%
technology, even though
it's super destructive--

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and the Greys, they shut
down several atomic bombs.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:84%
They were very, very aware
of how potentially dangerous

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:90%
that is.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But they calculated that
the best way to maneuver

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:31.720 align:middle line:84%
around things is to
give it to other places

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.110 align:middle line:84%
so that we have the
strategic balance

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:84%
because in some timelines,
things didn't turn out that

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.680 align:middle line:84%
well with the atomic
bomb just on one side.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do
you mean by balance?

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I think the
same balacing strategy

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:55.830 align:middle line:84%
that we find with the nuclear
bomb has happened to the UFO

00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:84%
craft thing with the Americans,
because at that time,

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Germany seemed to have explored
the technology of UFO crafts

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot more than any other
country in the world.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
evidence to that

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.110 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking about
the incident in 1947

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:25.320 align:middle line:84%
with Admiral Byrd who saw all
these craft in Antarctica.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.420 align:middle line:84%
You can see that the
Germans were pretty much

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.890 align:middle line:90%
ahead at that time.

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:32.400 align:middle line:90%
And there was some kind of acc--

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.590 align:middle line:84%
or let's say effort
from some species.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.610 align:middle line:84%
The Greys were trying
to balance out that.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:84%
But I'm pretty
sure that the Greys

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:51.780 align:middle line:84%
played at least some
role in bringing

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.660 align:middle line:90%
that UFO to the Americans.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And also bringing that
to the Russians as well,

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and them bringing
that to, I don't

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.100 align:middle line:90%
know, several other countries.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who's doing this,
the Ebens or the Greys?

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I think that because
the Ebens and the Greys

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:12.090 align:middle line:84%
were at war at that time,
and the Ebens were doing

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:17.040 align:middle line:84%
observation flights
over the US territory

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.550 align:middle line:84%
in order to see what's
happening with the A bombs

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and the nuclear
stuff over there,

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.130 align:middle line:90%
the Ebens were not invasive.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:90%
They are not an invasive--

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.080 align:middle line:84%
not so much invasive
at the Greys.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And my theory is
because they were at war

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.870 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys
realized, oh, when

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:84%
we bring that UFO down
and make it look naturally

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and the Americans
find that technology,

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:84%
then that will create Roswell
and Corona, and at some point

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.520 align:middle line:90%
it will turn out fine.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: With what we've
learned in this episode,

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.800 align:middle line:84%
how should we look
at our history now?

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I think the most
important thing, at least

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.180 align:middle line:84%
that I have learned
about history,

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:08.150 align:middle line:84%
is that history is
mostly a construct,

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and it depends heavily on
the perspective upon it.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:21.070 align:middle line:84%
We also learned that there are
lots of influences and forces

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:27.230 align:middle line:84%
that, I mean, put it positively,
that are trying to protect

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.040 align:middle line:90%
Earth, that are guiding Earth.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:38.920 align:middle line:84%
We haven't gone too much into
high influential beings that

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:45.650 align:middle line:84%
affected the Earth and giving
ideas and direction just

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.710 align:middle line:90%
by cognitive content.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:52.580 align:middle line:84%
That is also something that is
not so much hands-on history

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and manipulating
history and timelines,

00:32:55.010 --> 00:33:00.260 align:middle line:84%
but it's affecting
human history every day,

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:05.690 align:middle line:84%
because those ideas and
very significant ideas that

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:10.850 align:middle line:84%
bring this species, this
world, this evolution further

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.120 align:middle line:84%
into their evolution
and development

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:19.670 align:middle line:84%
are coming as ideas, spontaneous
ideas to some people.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And those people have
affected human history a lot.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.580 align:middle line:90%
A lot.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
very positive,

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's a good way
to think about it,

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:90%
that there is someone--

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:84%
not only one, but an
enormous number of beings

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.920 align:middle line:84%
that overlook what's
happening here.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.010 align:middle line:84%
They're guiding,
they're helping,

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and we always can
reach out to them.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Tim, that was amazing.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:50.535 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you very
much for having me.

00:33:50.535 --> 00:33:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:56.380 align:middle line:90%
Till next time.

[THEME MUSIC]

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.060 align:middle line:10%
>>ANNOUNCER: Next on
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: A lot of religious
ideas do come from contact

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:11.620 align:middle line:84%
with exotic beings,
higher influences.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And this species that
I'm talking about

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:19.719 align:middle line:84%
found it very important to let
us know that they influenced

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:90%
the Templars.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:25.630 align:middle line:84%
They also had greyish
skin and huge heads.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:30.139 align:middle line:84%
But different to the
Greys and other species,

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:34.159 align:middle line:84%
they looked and they had this
red cross upon their robe.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:40.480 align:middle line:84%
The Templars at that time
seemed to have received contact

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.840 align:middle line:90%
from those beings.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:53.000 align:middle line:90%
