00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:12.688 align:middle line:10%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:12.688 --> 00:00:19.068 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
I'm with David Adair,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.930 align:middle line:10%
Space Technology
Transfer Consultant,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.530 align:middle line:10%
US Navy Jet Engine Technician,
Field Researcher for the Office

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.790 align:middle line:10%
of Naval Intelligence.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
talking about Groom Lake.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:90%
David, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID ADAIR: Thank you.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.198 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What can you tell me
about this secret place that

00:00:35.198 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:90%
goes under so many alias names?

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: I know.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.830 align:middle line:10%
I never heard this place
other than Groom Lake

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:10%
when I was 17 back in 1971.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:10%
Apparently, it's got a lot
of activities going on there.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And people think that
I was working there.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:90%
I never worked there.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.247 align:middle line:90%
I just had a one-day visit.

00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:56.830 align:middle line:84%
They brought me there
to see something

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to show me and--

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, what did
they want to show you, David?

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: Well, I think
they were a little puzzled.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:10%
Because it took me 26 and
1/2 months to build Pitholem,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:10%
which was my big rocket.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:10%
And it was a different kind of
propulsion system altogether.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't liquid fuel
or solid propellant.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:10%
It was a fusion
containment drive.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did you
actually get exposed to that?

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: It started
when I was having dreams.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:90%
And these dreams came--

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.730 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't like you
have a dream and you

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:90%
can't recall it or something.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:90%
These came in consecutive order.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:90%
So I--

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: As a child, or as an
adult, you were having this--

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: I was a child.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that there was
something to these things.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:84%
It would just bother me all
day long in the waking hours.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:84%
So I took a notepad to bed, and
woke up, and right on the pad

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.425 align:middle line:84%
what I could remember,
and then go back to sleep.

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning,
really couldn't

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:84%
remember all that
stuff that well,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
till I flipped open the pad
and saw that, man, did that--

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:90%
it all came flooding back.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And wherever I ended
off in the dream,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:90%
the next night picked back up.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:90%
So it was like reading a book.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:84%
So I started the notebook
and 93 pages later

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:84%
finally got the
rest of it all in.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
looking at it.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
mathematical computation,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
where you started
trying to achieve

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:84%
what we call field containment
of an electromagnetic field.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in the world
calls me a rocket scientist.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.897 align:middle line:90%
I'm intelligent, I'm not that.

00:02:39.897 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: You're the Rocket Man.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: I know.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was it a conscious
creativity that you may have

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:90%
had?

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Or were you getting
messages, you think,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.443 align:middle line:90%
from another civilization?

00:02:50.443 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: I was
just 12 years old.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't know any difference.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to figure
out what was coming in.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that--

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:84%
now, I was flying
solid rocket engines.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.105 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to
liquid fuel, which

00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:04.480 align:middle line:84%
is a whole lot
more sophisticated

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:90%
with cryogenic fluids and--

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: All right.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're at what age
that people should know?

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: About 13.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: And starting to
become an old veteran now.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.255 align:middle line:84%
But this thing
with the dreams, it

00:03:15.255 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
was a different
kind of propulsion,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
being able to harness and
not just explode atoms--

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:84%
which we do, make a big hole
in the ground, hydrogen bombs.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you could
contain it, where

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.740 align:middle line:84%
would be in a
self-containing endless loop.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
You would have the
power of the sun.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
In a way, I just started
assimilating this thing

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:10%
And what I didn't know at
the time, when I met up

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.910 align:middle line:10%
with a general
through my mother, who

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:10%
was the nurse in charge
of the general's father--

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.860 align:middle line:10%
and anyway, this general, when
he showed up on the scene,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:10%
everything changed.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But he brought forces to bear
on endless material, supplies,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:84%
equipment, people,
labs all this stuff.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.097 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't have done that
being just a kid in the shop--

00:04:18.097 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right, no.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.668 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: That's not
what happened at all.

00:04:21.668 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge undertaking.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:90%
And this was like back in 1967.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard terms
like "black ops,"

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:90%
"black operations."

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.480 align:middle line:90%
You know, what is that?

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.680 align:middle line:90%
You never even heard it.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Didn't even know terms
like "first strike."

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.108 align:middle line:84%
Didn't even hear
that kind of stuff.

00:04:39.108 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:84%
But that's what this general
was after, and I didn't know it.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just trying to
get a propulsion system.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did he show you
any propulsion systems?

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what were
you exposed to--

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: No.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: --that you could
describe or the files that

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:90%
you've seen?

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.867 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: It was
really more of one-way.

00:04:53.867 --> 00:04:56.850 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to know what I
was doing and funded me.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I'm like a
starving dog in a meat house

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm getting everything
I need, the materials and stuff.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.720 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, this is so cool.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.220 align:middle line:90%
So I can't work on it enough.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting to get
the fields to condense

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:90%
into a pattern and shape.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And the way conventional
thought was back then

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
in the early '70s was wrong,
and is still wrong today.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:84%
They're still using tutorial
compressors and singularities.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.970 align:middle line:90%
You know, they're half right.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:90%
It takes two to do this.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And you want to go into
a figure eight pattern.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Because what's number
eight sideways in math?

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Infinity.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Infinity.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: So you build
an infinity flow design,

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and that's when it
started taking off.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.140 align:middle line:84%
What he knew that I didn't
know was, they have one already

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.680 align:middle line:84%
in their possession over in
a place called Groom Lake,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and he's watching me
construct one from scratch

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.327 align:middle line:90%
that looks just like a mirror--

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, my goodness.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: --of the one they
got, except theirs is huge,

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:84%
like the size of
an 18-wheel semi,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and mine's only
about 4 feet long.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know it, but I
was making myself a ticket

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:90%
to go to Groom Lake.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: I had built of a
functioning fusion drive unit.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And that goes back
to, people think

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm a rocket
scientist, Rocket Man.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as a hammer
is to a carpenter.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what a rocket is to me.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't rockets I
was interested in.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
It was just a medium
that I was using

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:84%
to test the theorem and
the hypothesis of a field

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.150 align:middle line:84%
containment for a fusion
containment device.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- you know, I wasn't
building a fusion containment

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.420 align:middle line:90%
rocket.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I was building a power plant,
a new type of fusion power

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
we could use to
power cities with.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What did the projects
want you to use it for?

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: That was a problem.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
That became a rub
between all of us.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Because of the speed--

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:84%
the thing's only got two
speeds, off and wide open.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:90%
There's no throttling.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:90%
There's no idling.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- because
it's really designed

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:84%
for a launch in
interplanetary space.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.490 align:middle line:84%
That's where it
would function best.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.307 align:middle line:84%
We covered 125 miles
in about 3.2 seconds.

00:07:24.307 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:90%
So you didn't even see it leave.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
It was like trying to see a
rifle bullet leave a barrel.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:10%
What happened once we did the
launch at White Sands, this guy

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:10%
that showed up at
White Sands after we

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:10%
got there named Arthur Rudolph,
he took control of the project.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.670 align:middle line:10%
He took my Colonel--

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:10%
Colonel Arthur Williams--
put him in a house arrest.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:10%
And then he took me and he
already had me land Pitholem

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:10%
exactly where he wanted it.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
They put it in a place
called Groom Lake, Nevada.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So I pulled one of the
geophysical maps to look at it

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and said, it's just a
big, dry lake bed there.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know,
we're riding on a DC-9.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said, them tires out there
are going to plow that thing's

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:90%
belly, we ain't going nowhere.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.635 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
land-- and told me shut up

00:08:17.635 --> 00:08:18.510 align:middle line:90%
and get on the plane.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And hours later,
sure enough, there's

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:90%
a big Air Force Base there.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Or some kind of base.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.630 align:middle line:84%
They had runways all
staked out and marked.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:90%
It was going to be big.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:84%
It was going to be
big twin runways.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.720 align:middle line:84%
We landed on a thing
that would be a taxiway.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:90%
They had it completed.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And pulled up to the center
hangar, and we got out.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And I saw Pitholem and its
parachutes out in the desert

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:84%
landed right where
they wanted it.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So now they got Pitholem and me
at Groom Lake, and they said,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:90%
we need to go look at something.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.570 align:middle line:90%
That's why you're here.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
going, now what on Earth

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.540 align:middle line:90%
would they want to show me here?

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What
did they show you?

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: Well, we
got in the hangar.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And sitting there in these
crazy looking golf cart things--

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think they weren't
running by propane tanks,

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.897 align:middle line:90%
and they weren't running on--

00:09:15.897 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:90%
they wasn't internal combustion.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what powered these
things, that's still today.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.572 align:middle line:84%
They just made this really
strange humming noise.

00:09:22.572 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:84%
We were just sitting
there waiting.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.905 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, what's
going to happen next?

00:09:25.905 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And all these little chains
come out of the floors

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and close off all the doors,
and the lights came on.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.865 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, I guess,
you know, it's like barriers.

00:09:36.865 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:84%
They don't want people walking
from outside walking in.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
I could see why, because
it'd be really uncomfortable,

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:84%
considering the whole
floor dropped down.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
The entire floor of this
hangar was an elevator.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.280 align:middle line:90%
So we're going down.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, man, the size
of this floor, the elevator,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I said, it can't be chains or
cables lowering this floor.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this-- see, I was right.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And we got down, you
could see them turning.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.155 align:middle line:84%
They were worm screws the
size of sequoia trees.

00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:90%
And there was like 12 of them.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So whatever they rolled
in and out of this hangar,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:90%
it was heavy and big.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Or at least, designed for it.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.112 align:middle line:84%
And we went down,
and down, and down,

00:10:19.112 --> 00:10:20.570 align:middle line:84%
was sitting there
waiting, waiting.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And I figured we were
about 200 feet down.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And we flushed
down on the floor.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And you look straight
ahead, and it was just

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:90%
this monstrous cavern shape.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:90%
It was a rainbow shaped roof.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:84%
The walls came to a canter,
and they became perpendicular.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what was
up with this place.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:84%
But big as that cavern was,
and you stick out your arms,

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:90%
and there's no shadows anywhere.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So I thought,
where's the lights?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:90%
Looking up, sides, floor.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no light
fixtures anywhere.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Nowhere.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: How did they do that?

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:90%
The only guess--

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting there going,
I guess the atmosphere.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:90%
We're breathing the lights.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Still don't know today.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:84%
But that started telling
me, this whole place

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:84%
is just technologically
not what it should be.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So we take off driving
down through there.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And I ask the two
guys in front of me--

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.110 align:middle line:84%
it was just an innocent
question, just--

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.795 align:middle line:84%
what did you do
with all the dirt?

00:11:30.795 --> 00:11:32.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, I thought that
was a fair question.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's a
really good question.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: And because there's
no dirt up on the floor that I

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:90%
could see.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Take that much dirt out, you'd
have a mountain upstairs.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:90%
And they get so mad about that.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
They said, you don't
need to worry about that.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I am
worried about it now.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:90%
So we're going down the floors.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And as we're traveling
down through there,

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:90%
you could see in the shops--

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
on each side there
were shops and offices,

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:84%
people working there, work
bays, and then hangar bays.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, the hangars,
when we go by, they

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.860 align:middle line:84%
had regular sliding
hangar doors.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.012 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
open, some were not.

00:12:11.012 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that were
open, what you could see

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:90%
was really odd.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I saw this first set of aircraft
that look like big teardrops

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:90%
with landing legs.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen
anything like that.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
models, because they

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:84%
were electric power,
hooked to them,

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
air conditioner
hoses, and drip pans.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, hell, they
got drip problems like I did.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:90%
So we went down into another--

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:90%
passed another hangar door.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And sitting in
there were these--

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine if you put
landing gear on an arrowhead.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what these
looked like, you

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:84%
know, like a big
arrowhead shaped aircraft.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And in 1971, we didn't
have stuff like that.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
thing I remember

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:05.400 align:middle line:84%
seeing in all the hangars was
this one big bomber delta wing.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:90%
It was shaped like a triangle.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was just gigantic.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was the XB-70.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.590 align:middle line:84%
But I know the XB-70,
one crashed in desert,

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and the other one in 1969 was
sent to Wright-Patterson Air

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.190 align:middle line:90%
Force Base Museum.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:90%
This was 1971, two years later.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's a third
one that didn't--

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:90%
nobody knows about.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: No one
knew about, right.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: And it looked
different from the regular

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:90%
XB-70.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:84%
The canards behind the
wings were shaped different.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And the engines
looked different.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Could have been Aurora.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could
have been Aurora.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like it.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.162 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: Yeah, that's
what I think it was.

00:13:43.162 --> 00:13:44.270 align:middle line:90%
But it was huge.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:90%
God almighty.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:10%
Then we went on down further.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And we were about a
quarter mile into it.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And still, you can look down at
the end, nowhere near anything,

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:84%
just infinity--
just keeps on going.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I still wanted to ask them, what
did you do with all the dirt?

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.005 align:middle line:84%
But the guy jumps out
of the little golf cart.

00:14:07.005 --> 00:14:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And he runs out
and puts his hands

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.760 align:middle line:90%
on this glass table top thing.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And he looks in the
scope, there's a flash,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and then this-- not
like the hangar doors--

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
a 40-foot-- it had to be
least 40-foot diameter--

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.685 align:middle line:90%
iris, like a camera--

00:14:23.685 --> 00:14:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yeah,
and it goes [ZIP]

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: Yeah, it's spinning.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:84%
It's opening up, and
I'm going, damn, that's

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:84%
the fanciest door
I've ever seen.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And a plate slides over at
the floor and makes it flush.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
We drive in, the lights
come up inside this big room

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.545 align:middle line:90%
about the size of a gymnasium.

00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, hey, I might
see some lights, you know,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:90%
fixtures.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:90%
No light fixtures.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Light comes up, just
nice and light at the--

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:90%
still no shadows.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Going, what's up
with this place?

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And that guard, when he
got out and put his hands

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle line:84%
on that thing, in
fact, I thought--

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.060 align:middle line:84%
today we go, oh, that was a palm
scanner and a retina scanner.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Man, we had nothing like that.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:90%
This is 1971.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even have a
handheld calculator yet.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
That will come later
from Texas Instruments.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, man, they are
not dealing with us on levels,

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.680 align:middle line:90%
what they have and don't have.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm thinking, what did
they bring me down here to see?

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the big room,
there's a stage type structure

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
built. It looks like
a stage platform.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But it must have
been heavy, whatever

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:39.547 align:middle line:84%
it was, because it had big steel
I-beams for crawl supports.

00:15:39.547 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And there was a curtain
hanging around this thing.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:90%
It was rubber, you could tell.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It looked like mud
flaps of a semi.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But these things must
have weighed tons.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's heavy.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: I've
picked up a mud flap.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:90%
They're about 100 pounds apiece.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.650 align:middle line:84%
This thing had cables
and the flaps raised up.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a curtain you
run up and look underneath it.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want you looking
underneath that thing.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.790 align:middle line:90%
So they raised it up, and I--

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking
at that going,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was ahead of
everybody, and I realized,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:90%
man I ain't nowhere.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I had an electromagnetic
fusion containment engine, just

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:23.498 align:middle line:84%
successfully launched, landed
up on the desert floor above us.

00:16:23.498 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I felt kind
of smug about that.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, hey, I did pretty good
for being a teenager and all,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:90%
and it worked.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.590 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But this thing was over 60
feet long, about 15 feet tall,

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:90%
I guess, 22 feet wide.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
It was an electromagnetic
fusion containment engine.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell by the way
they're shaped and designed--

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:90%
mine had the same shape--

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.500 align:middle line:84%
if you had a 4-cylinder internal
combustion engine four-stroke

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.422 align:middle line:84%
and a Model A block sitting
there and a Lamborghini block,

00:16:59.422 --> 00:17:01.880 align:middle line:84%
they're going to look the same,
because they're functioning

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.630 align:middle line:90%
in the same principle.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.880 align:middle line:84%
But the Lamborghini is
much more sophisticated.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
And that was the deal
with this thing--

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:84%
way more sophisticated
than anything I had.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And there were
steps to the stage.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And I said, can I go
up and look at it?

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Air Force people said no.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Rudolph says, yeah, go ahead.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we know
who's in charge.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So I go up the stairs
and go up to the thing.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And best way to
describe it, think

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:84%
of two octopuses, all their
tentacles arms all inter--

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:40.400 align:middle line:84%
they're all twisted together
and convoluted into two spheres

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.560 align:middle line:90%
which are the cyclotrons.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And the way they
rounded the plasma ducts

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:90%
was exactly the way that I went.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I went in a figure
eight component.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
This one was also in a
figure-eight component.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But the big, round
spheres part, they

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:90%
look different in material.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.530 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a
material look like that.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.240 align:middle line:84%
You ever see a
whale or a dolphin?

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to throw water on
it, keep it from drying out--

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:90%
That's what it looked like.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:84%
It looked more like
flesh, but it wasn't.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:90%
It was metal.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
looked really odd.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.762 align:middle line:90%
It was like an organic machine.

00:18:20.762 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Was it alive?

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel its consciousness?

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: Well, not at first.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.710 align:middle line:90%
But I got closer to it.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I got about
from here to you from it,

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:84%
the first thing I
see is my shadow.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I've been saying all
along, no shadows anywhere.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Turned around looking
for lights to see

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:90%
if it's casting a shadow.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:90%
No lights anywhere.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So I move my arms
with the shadows.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And my shadow is about a
split second behind me.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:84%
My guess was heat seeking
or heat recognition alloy.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:19:00.420 align:middle line:84%
It's picking up off of my
infrared or my heat energy,

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:84%
registering it on itself,
and that's why it's lit.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought, that was
pretty dang fancy at that.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:84%
But later I find out,
wrong about that.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:90%
Wrong about a lot of things.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So I reached out and
put my hand on it,

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and asked Rudolph if I
could climb up on top.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So it had an
ectoskeleton over it,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:90%
which was easy to climb up on.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:84%
It was like going
up a latticework.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I reached in
through the ectoskeleton part

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:84%
into the smooth area, as
soon as my hand got on it,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:84%
all these radiating waves took
off down through its side.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
blue, white motion--

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, those things they
put in the executives called

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:90%
a motion wave, keeps them calm?

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.075 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Right,
and keeps you calm.

00:19:47.075 --> 00:19:48.070 align:middle line:90%
It's like this wave went--

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: Yeah, it would move
like that down its side--

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: --down the side.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: And pull it
off, and it stopped,

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:90%
dissipate and go away.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Put it back on, it
starts up again.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So I turned round and
asked them about that.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's the way the Air
Force people were looking.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's mouths are
hanging down to here,

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:90%
including Rudolph.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Rudolph and them were--

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:84%
obviously hadn't seen
this reaction before.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So I put my hands back on it,
take them off, put them on,

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:90%
watch their faces.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of fun actually.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.552 align:middle line:84%
You know, and-- so I
crawled on up on top of it,

00:20:22.552 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:84%
walking down the vertebrates
of this thing-- it

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:90%
had vertebrates.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And it had like
ribbings down its side.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But in these
vertebrates and bones,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:37.700 align:middle line:84%
there are these
bundles of fiber tubes.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the tubes was a
liquid running through there.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But it had a almost
like a iridescent glow.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.690 align:middle line:84%
It's flowing through the
plastic tubing on a--

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:90%
almost like it's a pulse rate.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So I walk on down to the
center, where the fields

00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.300 align:middle line:84%
cross each other in the
figure eight, so right in its,

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
what I call the
eye of hurricane.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where it's calm
when the fury of the plasma

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.407 align:middle line:84%
is passing through
to the both sides.

00:21:08.407 --> 00:21:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Got to remember,
this thing is flowing

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:84%
from four different
directions at once.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's really something
to see when it's spinning.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Mine was.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So I looked over on
the side, and there's

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:84%
a hole blown in the
side of this thing.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's big.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be about 4
feet, 5 feet in diameter.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:90%
It's big.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And whatever hit it, it looked
like it came from the outside

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.750 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But this is where it
starts getting weird,

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:84%
if it ain't weird
enough already.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Instead of-- you know
how metal shrouds when

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:90%
it's pulled out or blowed in?

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:84%
This thing, best described,
imagine if you tuck a harpoon--

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
which has a grenade
in the end of it,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.390 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't know how it works,
and it goes into the whale,

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:00.330 align:middle line:90%
and it detonates.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.630 align:middle line:90%
It's what kills the whale.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And the whole blubber
blows back and all--

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.150 align:middle line:90%
this stuff looked like that.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:84%
It looked like meat
instead of metal.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But you reach out and
touch it, it's metal.

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:16.300 align:middle line:90%
None of it's making sense--

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it tissue
with metally thing?

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Is there a hybridization maybe?

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: Exactly.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:84%
It's everything-- you
know, D, all of the above.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.480 align:middle line:90%
But it's solid.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not soft or fleshy.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's got the look of
like something flesh-torn.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did it go through
the craft, or just--

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: It went through, yeah.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.697 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So there's another
hole in the other side.

00:22:36.697 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: No, it didn't
go all the way through.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
That would've been a real
concern for everybody,

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.190 align:middle line:84%
because if it had done
that there wouldn't

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:90%
have been nothing there.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Because you would
have penetrated

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:84%
the inner electromagnetic
field, and you'd

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.243 align:middle line:84%
been staring at 100
million degrees centigrade.

00:22:53.243 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:84%
That's 10,000 times hotter
than the core of the sun.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.785 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What could have
created this hole in the craft,

00:22:57.785 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:90%
do you think?

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: Some kind
of blast came in.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And this thing is
a power plant, OK?

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.970 align:middle line:90%
People say an engine.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a power plant.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:84%
You slide it into a
craft of some kind,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and you sit there and look at
the dimensions of this thing

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:90%
and do a proportionality.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.980 align:middle line:90%
You can figure it out.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.735 align:middle line:84%
That craft had to of been
bigger than a football field.

00:23:26.735 --> 00:23:27.535 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:23:27.535 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:90%
But near solid craft.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So I looked down in the
hole part, and there's--

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:90%
I can see stuff.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.302 align:middle line:90%
There's some lights down there.

00:23:37.302 --> 00:23:39.230 align:middle line:90%
It's blue.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So I ask Rudolph, can I crawl
down, take a look in here?

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And Air Force people
said, absolutely not.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Rudolph says, yeah, go ahead.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Hey.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So I got down in there,
wiggled in, slide down in.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And I must have went in
probably 5 or 6 feet into it.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Then when you get in
there, well, guess what?

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:90%
It's some kind of station--

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.540 align:middle line:90%
maintenance station, whatever.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.490 align:middle line:90%
There was-- what's left of it--

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:90%
was a chair.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
But the blast came in
from the outer wall,

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:90%
just annihilated this chair.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Starting to-- like it's on its
way through the whole thing--

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:26.180 align:middle line:84%
hits the inner wall of
the electromagnetic field,

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:90%
and it stopped.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:84%
It stopped it right there,
whatever the blast was--

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:90%
particle beam, whatever.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was these
control station

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.575 align:middle line:90%
mounts in front of the chair.

00:24:37.575 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did we put
anything in there?

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times
I've seen this before,

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:84%
where we bring our own things
inside to run tests and--

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: No, there was no
Earth-like detectors in there,

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Even the light itself
was coming off the walls.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So they haven't messed
with this area much.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Then there was these pods
on the station itself.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:90%
And you sit down.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And this thing is made for a
bipedal anthropoid, which I

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:90%
thought, that was interesting.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now,
that's interesting.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: And so I sit
down, put my feet down.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Not much of a seat to sit on.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:84%
It's blowed up
and disintegrated.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, well, whoever
would sit down in this thing,

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.310 align:middle line:84%
well, these must be
the control panels.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
So there was cutouts like
that in the top of the domes.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
hey, I can do that.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:37.680 align:middle line:90%
So I stuff my hands on them.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And as soon as I did that--

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I remember my mother telling
me, don't put your hands where

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.560 align:middle line:90%
you don't think they should be.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as I put
my hands on that thing,

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.607 align:middle line:84%
these interlocking
rings come flying up--

00:25:50.607 --> 00:25:52.940 align:middle line:84%
you know, ching, ching, ching,
ching, ching, like that--

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:90%
to my knuckles.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's got all
10 of my fingers.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:90%
And they're contracting.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.528 align:middle line:90%
They're tightening down.

00:26:00.528 --> 00:26:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought they were going
cut all my fingers off.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So I started yelling
for Arthur Rudolph.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:10.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, h-- and boy,
a voice as clear as day,

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.760 align:middle line:90%
in a Lauren Bacall accent--

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:20.930 align:middle line:84%
go figure that-- just this real
sultry voice, says, David, shh.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Quiet.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.715 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting there going, OK.

00:26:25.715 --> 00:26:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Can you lighten the grip up?

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.790 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.133 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't let go.

00:26:30.133 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did you think
about it or say it out loud?

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: No, I said out loud.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.887 align:middle line:84%
But the voice coming
in, it's audio.

00:26:37.887 --> 00:26:39.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, at least
I think it's audio.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, they
can't hear it out there.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there,
and I'm talking to it.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I'm
not saying anything.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, can I
have my hands back?

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.620 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:59.135 align:middle line:90%
There's something I need to do.

00:26:59.135 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you might
find this uncomfortable.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.910 align:middle line:10%
And when a doctor
tells you that,

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.780 align:middle line:10%
that means it's going to
hurt like hell, you know, so.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:84%
All all of a sudden,
it felt like a tingle,

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:84%
like electricity
going up each arm.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But you can feel
it moving up you.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.160 align:middle line:84%
That was starting
to weird me out.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And when it got up
to the neck to right

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.852 align:middle line:84%
here, at the carotid
arteries, boy, this thing

00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:27.560 align:middle line:84%
appeared in front me
like a heads-up gear

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:90%
you can see through it.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I could see the rest of
the panels through it.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But there was these
images started coming in.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.720 align:middle line:90%
And they were everything.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:90%
It's like a videotape going by.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's just flashing
images and starting getting

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.332 align:middle line:90%
faster and faster and faster.

00:27:45.332 --> 00:27:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And this is in
front of you on the display,

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.215 align:middle line:90%
on the heads-up display.

00:27:48.215 --> 00:27:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: Yeah, on this heads-up
display that's just hovering

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:50.720 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What were
these images of?

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Could you recognize anything?

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: Not at first.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:84%
But over the years later,
I could recall some of it.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were planets, and
solar system, and galaxies.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And one area, there
was this like--

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:84%
It looked like fleets and
tremendous battle going on.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.170 align:middle line:90%
And that flashed by.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Then more planets, stars.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw an image of the
actual power plant working.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.440 align:middle line:90%
It looked like it was left on.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Apparently-- Well
anyway, the stuff

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.330 align:middle line:84%
got up to there, all
these visions coming.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Till finally, it's burning in my
head, and my arms are burning.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm just burning.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
going to catch fire.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And finally I just said, stop.

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Or like, I can't take anymore.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And in went a few more seconds,
and then everything went quiet.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
whether it got through

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:84%
or it just quit, because
I couldn't think no more.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was starting to say, let
my fingers g-- and it let go.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
went, it let go,

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.100 align:middle line:84%
the pods closed closed up and
sunk down into the counter

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.420 align:middle line:90%
and closed over.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.855 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, hmm.

00:29:13.855 --> 00:29:15.980 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I even know
about these pods down here,

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.200 align:middle line:90%
you know, these domes.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm sitting there
going, I'm going now.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.392 align:middle line:84%
And all I hear was
it, yeah, let's go.

00:29:29.392 --> 00:29:32.250 align:middle line:90%
And I went, well, OK.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So I crawl out of this
thing, and I get up on top,

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and I felt like I was in
there for like a half hour.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.655 align:middle line:84%
But as far as they were
concerned, they said,

00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:44.050 align:middle line:90%
you're not staying any longer?

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.960 align:middle line:84%
It must have been just a
couple of minutes to them.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.370 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, well, there we go.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:49.840 align:middle line:90%
That's odd.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And by now, I would find
that strange anywhere else.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:84%
But with everything going
on, it didn't even--

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I said, some kind of
time displacement portal.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: But that
last message you said,

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.212 align:middle line:84%
that something was
coming with you.

00:30:03.212 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: Well, that's what--

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What-- now that--

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: And I was thinking
about that when I was crawling

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.070 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I went, I just said to myself,
what do you mean, let's go?

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:90%
You know, both of us?

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.820 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Because that
right there is a some sort

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.400 align:middle line:90%
of conscious telepathy language.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.210 align:middle line:84%
This is saying, hey,
I am aware of you.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.630 align:middle line:90%
We just made a connection.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:30.035 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm coming with you.

00:30:30.035 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: There was
another sentence with it.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.640 align:middle line:90%
But didn't make sense to me.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:90%
It said, come on, let's go.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm through working
with black arts.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea
what that meant.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.533 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the personnel--

00:30:45.533 --> 00:30:46.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So I crawled out of the
thing, get up on top,

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.550 align:middle line:84%
walking down to the
other end, and finally

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:55.640 align:middle line:84%
had to stop and start
asking questions.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm a 17-year-old
teenager in 1971.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Everything from adults
is always condescending.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down and I said,
the people who work on this

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:11.790 align:middle line:84%
are gone for their summer
vacation, took their notes

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.640 align:middle line:90%
with them, is what you told me.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:90%
I said, you know, this thing--

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.036 align:middle line:90%
look at it.

00:31:20.036 --> 00:31:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It's 60 feet long, and there's
not a single wire, nut, bolt,

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.570 align:middle line:90%
screw, weld line seam, nothing.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.940 align:middle line:84%
How in the hell
did you build that?

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And now they're starting to
frown and grumble down there.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this
thing is not ours,

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's not
theirs-- the Soviets.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.040 align:middle line:84%
This thing is not even
from the neighborhood.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.420 align:middle line:90%
I said, where did you get this?

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Did you shoot it down,
dig it up, or what?

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:90%
And now they're getting mad.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And Rudolph tells me with
a hiss, get off of it.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.880 align:middle line:90%
So I'm climbing down the side.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.670 align:middle line:10%
And I'm really pissed
off, because so much

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:58.920 align:middle line:10%
is going through
my head, been lied

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:04.530 align:middle line:10%
to about everything from start
to finish, prior to this,

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.400 align:middle line:10%
listened to national
anthems, had an American flag

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:13.330 align:middle line:10%
for a blanket, and now realize,
all that is just bullshit.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.960 align:middle line:84%
They're lying out
their teeth, sitting

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:84%
on this kind of technology,
not sharing it with anybody.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.020 align:middle line:90%
So I'm really pissed off.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And so as soon as I go on down
the vertebrates or down the

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:31.940 align:middle line:84%
ribs, slap my hand back on the
other end where it's smooth,

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's no longer
little blue waves.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:37.470 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a flame thrower.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.800 align:middle line:84%
It looks like fire going
down through there.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And I let off, and
I put it back on.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, what is
that thing doing?

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And as I calm down,
the fire lets off,

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.410 align:middle line:90%
and the blue waves come back.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.260 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, oh, god.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.520 align:middle line:90%
This thing is a mood ring.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.320 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.355 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Did it reverb back?

00:32:58.355 --> 00:32:59.155 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: Yeah.

00:32:59.155 --> 00:33:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: And you saw this flow?

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: As my mind is
watching it, I'm calming down.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so pissed off.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:84%
As I calm down, the flames
go away, and here comes

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.220 align:middle line:90%
the blue waves back.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:14.030 align:middle line:84%
So this thing's-- it's
reacting to your thoughts.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Glad you didn't get too
angry, because the whole thing

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:17.940 align:middle line:90%
would have torched.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: Yeah, it might ignite.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'd better
get off this thing.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So I get down, get on the
floor, come on down with them.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.230 align:middle line:84%
They just throw me in the
back of the golf cart,

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.120 align:middle line:90%
and we ride off.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm on the back in,
you know, facing out.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.080 align:middle line:90%
They're up in the seats.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.510 align:middle line:90%
And we're moving.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.870 align:middle line:84%
That's an important
detail, because the wind

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.130 align:middle line:90%
is blowing through.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So when they're
whispering to each other--

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: You hear everything.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: It's blowing
it right in my ear.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: You hear everything.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.207 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: So I've just got
to turn my head like that

00:33:48.207 --> 00:33:49.040 align:middle line:90%
and listen.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:49.873 align:middle line:90%
And I can hear them.

00:33:49.873 --> 00:33:52.770 align:middle line:84%
They said, we've got to
get this kid to show us

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.770 align:middle line:90%
how this thing operates.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:56.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, if we don't
get this in time,

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.720 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to have
first strike solution.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
going, first strike?

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Are they playing
baseball down here?

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:05.315 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd never
heard this term.

00:34:05.315 --> 00:34:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: 1971, yeah.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: 1971.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Never heard of first strike.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.780 align:middle line:90%
And then they said, we've got--

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.650 align:middle line:84%
with the pressure with
Soviet Union, Vietnam,

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:17.930 align:middle line:90%
all this stuff--

00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:84%
and I went Vietnam
and Soviet Union?

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:23.600 align:middle line:90%
I went, oh, man.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.659 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's
going on right now

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:84%
is General Westmoreland
is getting his butt kicked

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:84%
in Vietnam supplied by
the Ho Chi Minh trail

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.370 align:middle line:90%
by the Soviet Union.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.739 align:middle line:90%
It's a big mess going on.

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And what these guys
are doing, they're

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.810 align:middle line:84%
looking for something
that can win MAD--

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.504 align:middle line:90%
Mutual Assured Destruction.

00:34:43.504 --> 00:34:45.085 align:middle line:90%
And I knew about that.

00:34:45.085 --> 00:34:47.340 align:middle line:10%
We learned about that.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, the only way
to win MAD is first strike.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Which, that concept's
even crazy--

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's
a scary concept.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: It is.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, when I
confronted them later about it,

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.360 align:middle line:90%
they said--

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I asked them, what
about the Soviet subs?

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:90%
You can get to silos.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.880 align:middle line:90%
What about the subs?

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, we figure we can lose
30%, 35% of the population.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.830 align:middle line:90%
We find that acceptable.

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Not if you're in
the 30%, you're not

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.310 align:middle line:90%
going to find it acceptable.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing was
just nuts back then.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did you have any
communications with this

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:22.970 align:middle line:90%
conscious craft since you left?

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: Communication
has never stopped.

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:30.700 align:middle line:84%
It's been continuous, day and
night forever, ever since I

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.840 align:middle line:90%
left.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear voices.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But what I get is
feelings, impressions.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Everything is through feelings.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: I'm just a puny human.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing with
something here that--

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I find out later through
impressions and feelings--

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:52.270 align:middle line:84%
this thing comes from an
entirely different way

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:56.230 align:middle line:84%
of living than we
even can conceive.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:59.830 align:middle line:84%
This thing is like whales
born in deep oceans

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:02.150 align:middle line:90%
between the galaxies.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're not thousands
of years old or she's like--

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and she's got a name,
Pitholem, where it came from--

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:15.840 align:middle line:84%
she's like 8.2
billion years old.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine how
advanced that race is?

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.000 align:middle line:90%
She just laid it out.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.060 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't kidding,
said, let's go.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you believe
maybe some consciousness from

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.280 align:middle line:84%
the craft went with you
in your consciousness?

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just a direct link
of consciousness, since we're

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.810 align:middle line:90%
all connected anyway?

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: No, this was, with
the hands on the domes, no,

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.390 align:middle line:90%
this was personal.

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:40.890 align:middle line:90%
This is really personal.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I left,
remember the blue light?

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: It went out.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So whatever power was in the
power plant, its entity--

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Maybe you were
the carrier for this light.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: I have feeling I've
got a conscious stuck in me.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way I can
explain to y'all, is that this

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:90%
thing decided to leave.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.610 align:middle line:90%
And think about it.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Who sent me my dreams?

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Knowing I'd build this rocket;
knowing that people like LeMay

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:20.750 align:middle line:84%
would show up; knowing that
eventually they would get me

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to a proving ground to
test it that would bring

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:28.280 align:middle line:84%
another layer of people,
Rudolph and his company;

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.180 align:middle line:84%
knowing that takes me
out to Groom Lake, where

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I see this thing; knowing I'm
going to crawl up in and put

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.090 align:middle line:84%
my hands on the pods;
knowing it's time to use me

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:39.428 align:middle line:90%
as a life boat, and off we go.

00:37:39.428 --> 00:37:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You're like
a galactic paramedic.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.970 align:middle line:84%
You just basically
pulled this consciousness

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.180 align:middle line:84%
of this being out of
a deadly situation,

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's been with
you ever since.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: Oh, yeah.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:50.330 align:middle line:90%
It's been--

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Has it changed
your belief systems?

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: Oh, god, yeah.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:53.530 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:56.210 align:middle line:90%


00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
people like me so much?

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm a personable
rocket scientist?

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my whole existence
don't even make sense.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.080 align:middle line:90%
If you do the science I can do--

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.640 align:middle line:84%
the mechanics,
electronics, everything--

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.220 align:middle line:90%


00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and can sit down with a
group of Hell's Angels

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and get along with them
like a good old boy,

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.930 align:middle line:84%
or go over and sit with a
bunch of scientists at MIT,

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:31.580 align:middle line:90%
all in the same day.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.127 align:middle line:90%
And that's not--

00:38:33.127 --> 00:38:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It's not normal.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:35.377 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: And that's not me.

00:38:35.377 --> 00:38:37.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not that spectacular.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:39.160 align:middle line:90%
It's something else going on.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.250 align:middle line:84%
But I've learned, I
have been able to learn

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.520 align:middle line:90%
to adapt and go with this.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.740 align:middle line:90%
But man, I'll tell you what.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.670 align:middle line:84%
There are times when
I do stuff, and I just

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.730 align:middle line:90%
go, man, that's not me.

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:53.530 align:middle line:90%
I can't--

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Exactly.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAIR: I'm not that good.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Stuff I can do is just endless.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's across the board.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.510 align:middle line:90%
It's in everything.

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:06.660 align:middle line:84%
It's in psychology, in
history, in mathematics,

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.600 align:middle line:90%
physics, computers.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did you get any
messages or feelings about

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:18.980 align:middle line:84%
the future of, you
know, the human race?

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: Well, like
it was relayed to me,

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.780 align:middle line:84%
not every world runs on
a Julius Caesar calendar,

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:31.240 align:middle line:84%
or even operate in a
chronological timeline.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, we're probably
some of the few species

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:34.700 align:middle line:90%
that do that.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Most of the rest of the
universe out there goes,

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.300 align:middle line:84%
there is no such creature
that runs on a consecutive

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:45.860 align:middle line:84%
timeline-- you know, he's 30
years old, he's 31, he's 32--

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.460 align:middle line:90%
nothing lives like that.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.540 align:middle line:90%
We're an oddity.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So they go about an entirely
different way of doing things.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:57.540 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:01.890 align:middle line:84%
This thing got damaged
in some kind of battle,

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:05.010 align:middle line:84%
crash landed on the planet,
dropped its power plant.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:05.843 align:middle line:90%
Ship went home.

00:40:05.843 --> 00:40:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't know what
happened to them-- crew,

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.510 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
happened to them.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But the power plant wasn't
through, and it's not alone.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.860 align:middle line:90%
It's got family.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And what may be 45 years
for it sitting there--

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It's not.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAIR: --it's only
about 30 minutes.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's families en route.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:27.640 align:middle line:90%
It's coming.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.495 align:middle line:90%
I'm 65.

00:40:28.495 --> 00:40:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I hope it hurries up,
because its lifeboat is

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:31.710 align:middle line:90%
going to keel over here.

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, thanks,
Dave, for coming on the show.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.630 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate having you.
