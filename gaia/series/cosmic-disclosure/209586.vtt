00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:21.670 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:10%
we're with David Adair, a
space technology consultant

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.170 align:middle line:10%
and retired field
officer from the Office

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.250 align:middle line:10%
of Naval Intelligence.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.100 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us is
Tim, a tactical advisor

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.980 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts trying
to understand the missions

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.160 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of non-human
intelligences on our planet.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thanks.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.242 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Thank you.

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, we seemed
to hit a turning point here

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.700 align:middle line:84%
with Disclosure with the
Congress and the Pentagon.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
We're talking no more
UFOs, we're talking UAPs--

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:84%
What do you think that
is going to change

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.400 align:middle line:90%
in the world moving forward?

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: In the UFO
community, not a thing.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.343 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: (LAUGHING) Right.

00:00:57.343 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: But in the general
community and the rest

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.708 align:middle line:84%
of the world, where
people will think,

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:04.000 align:middle line:84%
yeah, oh, you're talking
about them people wearing them

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:84%
aluminum hats, that crowd, that
could have an effect on them.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.900 align:middle line:90%
We were speaking earlier.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Flying implies something
constructed and built,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:90%
a machine.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:10%
But aerial phenomena,
that could be a cloud.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's very clever
wording, is what it is.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It is, yes.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: But it could
have a positive effect.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
But for the old hardcore
researchers, they don't care.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Like I said earlier, it sounds
like a duck, walks like a duck,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:90%
must be a duck.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What do you think, Tim?

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, I think the most
powerful people on this planet

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
have finally realized that there
are at least 15 reasons why

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.060 align:middle line:84%
disclosure is a good thing
and even a necessary thing.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean, you have
direct contact with this word.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:84%
For the people that came
up with it, I believe.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, it was the British
team who came up with that.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So the reason for it is
that the human brain mostly

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
organizes things
through language, which

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
means if you have an old term
coming from even the World

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:84%
War times, which
is UFO, you have

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:84%
certain so-called
cognitions to it.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So you have certain
ideas, certain patterns

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:90%
how to think about it.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And once you reframe that word
and you bring a new terminology

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to it, then you have
the chance to make up

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:84%
new fields in the memory
and the brain of people.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can put some new
information and cognition

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.850 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty basic and,
well, still effective

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:84%
technique that's been used in
governance for quite some time.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there an
agenda behind that?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.553 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, yeah, definitely.

00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What is that?

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well what we've
seen is that in the 1940s,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:90%
UFOs were a thing.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:90%
People got scared.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:90%
It got ridiculed.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So you have a lot of ideas
coming with the topic.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:84%
If you put it into
another term, you make up

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:90%
new space in people's brain.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And you put some
new neurons to it

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:84%
so people can have
new ideas about it.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically
erasing the old term

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and making space
for something new.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So definitely there's an
agenda to it, of course.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where do you guys
see the UAP narrative going?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the government
and the military

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.690 align:middle line:84%
have jumped into
this full blast.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And you don't hear the word UFO
anymore when it comes to them.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, it's about time to
get things into transparency.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I would have wished that
the possibility that we're

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by lifeforms that we
can live with and make friends

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.630 align:middle line:84%
with and grow together
and learn from each other,

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:84%
that this is reason enough
to come forward and talk

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
about all these amazing
realities that are happening.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
To my understanding,
it's basically

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:84%
our right to know who
we are and what we are

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:90%
and what we're doing here.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: David, do
you think different ET

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.072 align:middle line:84%
races are working with
different competing governments?

00:04:39.072 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I don't know if
the ET is working with them.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.480 align:middle line:84%
But I know there's a terrible
civil war interstruggle

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:90%
between the agencies.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And what their weapon of
choice is is information.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they use
that information, that's how

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:90%
they get granted funds or not.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's a fierce competition
among the agencies

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:90%
to get funded.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they're guarding the
information really tight.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you
heard of any ET races

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
working with
different governments

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and also sharing technology
with the different governments?

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: None that
I'm familiar with.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Changing the name
was really smart,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:84%
because I ran into
trouble with a guy who is

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:90%
mainstream America, well known.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And I called to tell
him that it reminded me

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.198 align:middle line:84%
of who I was when I was a
young kid working with him.

00:05:37.198 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me what
I've been doing.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, I got
tangled up with Area 51.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:10%
He wanted to quit talking to me.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Because Area 51 was
like UFO to him.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
I ain't going

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.405 align:middle line:90%
to let this guy get to me.

00:05:51.405 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:10%
Another friend on the
phone said, let him go.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:10%
No, wait a minute.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.877 align:middle line:10%
I said, do you believe
in Bill Clinton?

00:05:59.877 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:10%
He goes, the President
of the United States?

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:10%
He was the President
of the United States.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:10%
Remember him?

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.935 align:middle line:10%
Of course, I do.

00:06:05.935 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:10%
Well, you believe he
was the president?

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, do you know that he
told the federal courts to sue

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:10%
Area 51 over a guy that
was exposed to something

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:10%
in a chemical waste
dump and they had him

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:10%
in a hospital room in Las
Vegas, and he was literally

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:10%
melting on the table?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:10%
His wife was screaming for help.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Reaches the Clinton
administration.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Bill Clinton allows
her to sue Area 51.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It's registered in
the federal courts.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Signed by the President
of the United States.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Now he wants to talk to me.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And I tell him, I ain't
got time to talk to you.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:90%
I hung up on him.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.433 align:middle line:84%
It's that stereotyping
that they're doing.

00:06:50.433 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
they made the move

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.780 align:middle line:84%
to change this to unidentified
aerial phenomenon.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And they went from flying
object to flying phenomenon.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Very smart.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Very clever wording.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to open up
things a little bit more.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.540 align:middle line:90%
People willing to step out.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.370 align:middle line:90%
But it still irritates me.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.850 align:middle line:90%
You can't even mention Area 51.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:90%
They think you're a fruitcake.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, I
just explained to you

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.557 align:middle line:84%
the President of
the United States

00:07:16.557 --> 00:07:18.380 align:middle line:84%
has signed off on
a federal lawsuit.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:90%
The woman lost, by the way.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Do you know Area 51 is
exemptive all EPA laws?

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, they have
to be, or they shut down.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.597 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That's right.

00:07:27.597 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And so no telling what
this man got exposed to do.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do ETs have
influence over information

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:90%
that's released to the public?

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.600 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Not directly,
I would say.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So basically, again, we were
talking about certain sets

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:90%
of laws that are in place.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Beside temporal law, it's also
the responsibility for a planet

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
is to the species
inhabiting the planet.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Basically
those species that

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
are currently inhabiting
Earth oversee the disclosure

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.430 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.388 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: During a Russian
intelligence meeting,

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:84%
it was brought up that
we have an open system.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:84%
It was also brought up
that it's the possibility

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:84%
of non-human
intelligences that are

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:90%
manipulating the governments.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard
anything like this?

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So if the question
that is Earth self-governing,

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:36.570 align:middle line:84%
or is it influenced by
outside forces, it's both.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's the effect of outside
and inside is of always--

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is
the agenda, then,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:90%
of the non-human intelligences?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So basically,
every individual,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.150 align:middle line:84%
every bigger species,
every nation,

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:84%
every politician has
their own agenda.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.775 align:middle line:90%
So it's big.

00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know how
many species are involved?

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.156 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: More than you
could know, basically.

00:09:03.156 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's a phase of high
attention right now.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So there are basically
probably hundreds

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
of lifeforms that are
involved with the process

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:90%
that we have right now.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And not all of them
are in a what you

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:90%
would call 3D physical form.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: But as well, there
are also temporal life forms.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:84%
There are higher frequency
life forms bringing structure

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.400 align:middle line:84%
into all this
process pretty wild.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It sounds like it.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's been reports
for a long time, that's

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:84%
been going on for a
long time, about UAPs

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:90%
hovering over major areas.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Like Jerusalem, the Pentagon,
the Kremlin, the White House.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Even the Pyramids.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, it's happening
at all these special areas.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:90%
These really significant areas.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it a strategic thing?

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:90%
What do you think they're doing?

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I think it's
a conditioning program.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They're
trying to get everybody

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.420 align:middle line:84%
used to seeing orbs and
disks flying everywhere.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So if they do show up in
force to make full contact,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't be such
panic in the streets

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
that the government keeps
saying is going to happen.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that'll
be the case at all.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
biggest dangers is--

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.180 align:middle line:84%
the non-human life forms have
to be aware of this one--

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:84%
can you imagine the
level of corruption

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:90%
they're dealing with?

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those aliens that
have to deal with senators,

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.540 align:middle line:90%
congressmen, politicians.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Professional liars, all.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Some don't
even have an idea.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And want
money, money, money.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: So man, what a mess.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:90%
I feel bad for the aliens.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in America, I know how
the mechanism works there.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:84%
There is one group that
controls this information.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It's called the US
Senate Subcommittee

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:90%
on Science and Technology.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the same group of
people that run NASA.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And their chairman
of their committee

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
is the Vice President
of the United States.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what's
their agenda?

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Who knows?

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how does that fit
in with this conglomeration

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
of these UAPs being seen
in these famous areas?

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, they want to
disclose it to the public.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:90%
They get them ready.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:84%
That may be a big
meeting coming.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And probably squeeze whatever
money they can find in there

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.382 align:middle line:90%
to get it out.

00:11:41.382 --> 00:11:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, what's interesting
is when you mentioned

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.155 align:middle line:84%
corruption, some
of these species

00:11:45.155 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:84%
don't even have an idea or
a concept of corruption.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.655 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They're
going to get it.

00:11:48.655 --> 00:11:49.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:50.765 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That is true.

00:11:50.765 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And so basically what we've
seen is in the history

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
that some species just saw
some problems on the planet

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and thought, hey, we might
give some technology.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And people will use it for
their mutual benefit, which

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.818 align:middle line:90%
is the logical thing to do.

00:12:05.818 --> 00:12:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Or mutual destruction.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, but,
again humanity has

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.130 align:middle line:84%
this very unique, rare
psychological pattern

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:84%
that they keep things
for themselves, you know?

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.112 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, they're
going to learn the phrase,

00:12:19.112 --> 00:12:20.160 align:middle line:90%
what's in it for me?

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.247 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They'll hear
that all the time.

00:12:22.247 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right, right.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I can imagine
an alien world has

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle line:84%
no corruption, hearing
that going, what is that?

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
What does he mean,
what's in it for me?

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, imagine you're
on a tree or something

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:90%
and you're hanging.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're on the bridge
of falling to death.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And someone reaches to you
and gives you a ladder.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And you don't use it, because
someone else could see it,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
But basically, to come
back to your question,

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Emery, you have to look at
each incident individually.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:84%
If you want to simplify it,
you basically have crafts.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
When you have crafts, that is
divided into manmade crafts

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle line:90%
and ET crafts.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically the
most simplified form

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The media is always
talking about these sightings.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're very quick to
get that information out

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and to show the videos
of, say, the Tic Tac.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.230 align:middle line:84%
But they're never talking
about the intelligence

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:90%
behind the craft.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.893 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Simple reason why
they can't tell you about

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:90%
the intelligence--

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.230 align:middle line:84%
they can't admit to
it to be a confession.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it's intelligently
driven or piloted.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Which means it's a
technology you can't control.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.300 align:middle line:90%
You don't know where it's going.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
You're not in
control of the skies.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.890 align:middle line:90%
You got big problems.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.070 align:middle line:90%
They can't say that.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They probably actually
know, but they can't tell you.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.803 align:middle line:84%
That's an admission
of guilt. That,

00:13:59.803 --> 00:14:01.470 align:middle line:84%
hey, there's something
flying out there,

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.690 align:middle line:90%
and we're not in charge.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Different countries
with different media.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:90%
They report different things.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
reporting everything.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.595 align:middle line:90%
So why is that?

00:14:13.595 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's the way the
structure of that country

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.720 align:middle line:90%
is built on perceptions.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.980 align:middle line:84%
For example, in our
movies in America,

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:84%
we can't show any
T or A. However,

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
you can show somebody being
gutted and disemboweled,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and that's just fine.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.617 align:middle line:84%
France is sitting there going,
what is wrong with y'all?

00:14:34.617 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:84%
We'll show the T and
A, but we ain't showing

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:90%
anybody getting disemboweled.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So once again, it's
back to the perception

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
that the French people
versus the perception

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:90%
of the American people.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, that's
through classical conditioning.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I think it's even
deeper than that.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the mentality
of the different countries.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Which nobody wants to say that.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Because America
is just downright stupid

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.160 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to it.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.280 align:middle line:84%
The other countries are
taking some different leads

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:90%
and doing a decent job.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.687 align:middle line:84%
Too bad we can't get
unified on the subject.

00:15:14.687 --> 00:15:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What do you think, Tim?

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's target groups.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:84%
What you have is a pretty
heterogeneous mixture

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:84%
of target groups
around the planet.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a big bowl of all kinds
of mindsets and belief systems.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing
that people want to see

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:84%
is the established system,
power system, basically,

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:84%
to be shaken in a way
that it collapses.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So basically you have a lot
of different target groups

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that are being
approached differently.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And the mainstream
basically gets prepared for,

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:90%
yes, there are UFOs.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:90%
There are UAPs.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:90%
We're not alone in the universe.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.690 align:middle line:90%
There's one other race.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:84%
There might be a second
one or something.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.270 align:middle line:84%
But that might take
some more time.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And basically they
get technology

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:84%
that's over 70 years
or something old

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.690 align:middle line:84%
in order to fix some
problems and get society

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:32.910 align:middle line:84%
into a more functional,
up-to-date state of mind.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
specialized target groups.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Which is mainly the reason
why I can speak on Gaia,

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:84%
is educating a
very specific group

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:48.210 align:middle line:84%
of intelligent and
mindful people.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're basically not
doing basic training.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.187 align:middle line:84%
But we're giving pretty
deep information.

00:16:57.187 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like you
said, it's targeted.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:59.925 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's absolutely--

00:16:59.925 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's a very
targeted audience.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.682 align:middle line:84%
And like you said
with the countries,

00:17:02.682 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:90%
it's targeted information.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And different countries
have different histories.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:84%
Germany has a World War
II trauma in their DNA.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So they have to deal
with that as well.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When the United States
released the Tic Tac videos,

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.829 align:middle line:84%
for example, did
they have to check in

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:24.869 align:middle line:90%
with Russia, Europe, China?

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Is it a group collective thing
where they all agree on this?

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Or did we just do it?

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: If they did,
we'll never know about it.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:84%
They won't tell us that they
have an intergovernmental group

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that will OK say something
and not OK something.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But really especially
for America's sake,

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe the reason we're
having the disclosure

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:84%
and all this stuff and the
pace that they're moving at,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.478 align:middle line:84%
I think they're really concerned
they're about to get busted.

00:18:02.478 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:84%
They're going to get caught
in one of the biggest

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:90%
lies in world history.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
That they've been lying through
their teeth for the last 75

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.553 align:middle line:84%
And when it starts unraveling,
it's going to keep going.

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know,
we're going to be knowing

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:18.588 align:middle line:90%
about people on the moon.

00:18:18.588 --> 00:18:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's inevitable.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.497 align:middle line:84%
They're like the
little boy that's

00:18:21.497 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:90%
putting his finger in the dam.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:90%
And Dutch boy.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to
run out of fingers.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's just going
to crumble on him.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's going to break.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're just trying
to save their butts, what

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.032 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to do.

00:18:33.032 --> 00:18:34.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, we told you about that.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.350 align:middle line:90%
We disclosed.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.940 align:middle line:90%
75 years later you did.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.862 align:middle line:90%
Way back, god, decades.

00:18:44.862 --> 00:18:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you're saying
it's like a soft disclosure

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:90%
by doing this.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It is.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:90%
For them.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:90%
For us, it's a soft disclosure.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:90%
For them, this is traumatic.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:84%
It really is a
big deal for them.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:84%
They have really stepped
way out on a limb

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:90%
that they normally never do.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.410 align:middle line:84%
They stay back against
the tree trunk.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:84%
But this time, they really
stepped out on a limb.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:10%
And somebody is threatening
to saw the limb off.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what the problem is.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:90%
And they're fessing up to it.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:90%
They see it coming.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So who is behind that?

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Is it human?

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Non-human?

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They're mostly human.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
The humans who have
signed the contracts,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:84%
they don't want their
names to be read out

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:34.350 align:middle line:84%
on the paper when we find out
that we cut treaties with them.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember a treaty?

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember one.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody signed
treaties, oh my god,

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:84%
they might have even got where
they exchange homeless people,

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:90%
street people for--

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: --technology.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that just be a
hoot, seeing your name

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.737 align:middle line:90%
on that contract?

00:19:50.737 --> 00:19:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: No one
questions the millions

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
of people that are going
missing every year.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Get to the moon people.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And they got
a contract up there.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:84%
In the 50s, they were greedy
as heck and just cut whatever

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.260 align:middle line:90%
deal they could get.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So David,
why now, then?

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Something has
happened somewhere to somebody,

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know what.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But this is a knee jerk
reaction, that's what it is.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:90%
And everybody knows what it is.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:90%
It's knee jerk.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Now the one group that
you can't control is ETs.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
They maybe finally said,
yeah, we might sign

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:90%
that paper called a treaty.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:36.348 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to tell all
your people, we're here.

00:20:36.348 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and we're going to
let them read the contract

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.348 align:middle line:90%
and look at your names.

00:20:39.348 --> 00:20:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, man.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
What do you think this
contract signer is going to do?

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Other than crapping
the floor, they're

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:90%
going to run for their lives.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.488 align:middle line:84%
And we should have had
this hashed out long ago.

00:20:50.488 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A long time ago.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: When it first
happened, been no big problem.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we got aliens here.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Hey, how's it going?

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.220 align:middle line:90%
And just deal with it.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.510 align:middle line:84%
But covering it up, covering
it up, covering up, now you're

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.230 align:middle line:84%
going to have such hurt
feelings, such distrust,

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and downright, outright
revenge seeking

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:90%
by the public from this.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.788 align:middle line:84%
And it's all their fault.
They chose to do it this way.

00:21:15.788 --> 00:21:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, do
you see it that way?

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It's going to
be a long answer if you

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:90%
want to have all the details.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.878 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:21.878 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
it's a conglomerate

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
of countries, groups,
families, agencies,

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:90%
military brands, corporations.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.520 align:middle line:84%
ETs as well that gather
together and discuss the way

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.820 align:middle line:84%
how disclosure globally
should turn out.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So again, every country is
in charge for themselves.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
What we also see,
if you want to,

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:84%
for example, get the
media from Russia,

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I assume you will not
perceive them here in the US.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:90%
I assume.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:90%
I didn't try it.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.260 align:middle line:90%
But in Europe, it's blocked.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So how they do it,
people will not see it.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:84%
The information, the
Pentagon information

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:84%
that is treated pretty
seriously in the US,

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:84%
is treated differently
in the media

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:90%
in different, other countries.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Because they need a
much slower process.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Which means they have found
another weather balloon story.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:25.950 align:middle line:90%
You know, that the--

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: --that they
brought into it.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:34.934 align:middle line:84%
The reason why disclosure
now, and it's five minutes

00:22:34.934 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:90%
past 12:00, I guess.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Some ETs do put
their thumb upon it.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're not pushing
the brakes on it.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So they are putting some
pressure on the government,

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.670 align:middle line:84%
because they do want
people to know that.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Because they see it as a
natural evolutionary thing.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And as everything in the
universe is connected,

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:84%
it's necessary for
the consciousness

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:10.710 align:middle line:84%
of people on this planet to be
informed about what they are,

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:84%
where they are, and
how to deal with that.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Basically there are also,
as you said, contracts.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So they have every
right in the world

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:25.250 align:middle line:84%
to stand in for their contract
and say, hey, you signed that.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.280 align:middle line:90%
So we have an agreement.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Do something about it.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
other reasons about it.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And another soft
reason for disclosure

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:84%
is, of course,
monetary thinking.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Because this whole
planet is not at all

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:90%
optimized for interspace trade.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Which is big money machine.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:90%
People see that.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
There are some risks that
not knowing of ET presence

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:90%
can have.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Basically not technology,
but psionically.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Which means there's a psychic
effect of some species that

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:13.700 align:middle line:90%
are well trained.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So they can basically
psychologically

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:90%
influence people.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And humans that just run around
with no thoughts in their mind

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:84%
could be a quite easy
target in that way.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's some teaching to
be done in order to prepare

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.890 align:middle line:90%
the species for such events.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:84%
But then again, there
is also something

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:84%
that is a more energetical
shift that's happening.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
we are all going

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:84%
through a shift of consciousness
if you want or not.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And the risks that
could occur are

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:55.940 align:middle line:84%
much higher than any military
brand could handle alone.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Which is basically where
the worst case scenario

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:06.020 align:middle line:84%
is a so-called mass
psychosis, which would

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.240 align:middle line:90%
be a change in the reality.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And at such a sudden speed
that all the creation

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:18.480 align:middle line:84%
we got has a negative
effect on it.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:90%
So that could cause problems.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing is
preparing people for--

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.270 align:middle line:84%
there is a much broader,
wider field of reality.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, theoretically, and
I've been in that field,

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:84%
so I know that
these things work.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But seeing people that
two years ago said,

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:84%
there's no UFO, no aliens, no
Bigfoot, no whatever, you know?

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And now saying they're saying
something like, oh, yeah, UFO,

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:90%
it's no big deal.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.220 align:middle line:90%
It's been on the news.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That's different.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:90%
The difference.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What a mind control
item there, that technology.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I tell you, when you--

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.080 align:middle line:84%
serious, back these
treaties and agreements--

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:90%
a generation is 35 years.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Two generations, 70 years back.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Look for names like LBJ,
Nixon, and Rockefeller,

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:90%
and Henry Kissinger.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And you might not
know some of these names,

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:84%
but they were powerful
people at that time.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:90%
They could sign.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: And I think trying
to find the answer to why

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.500 align:middle line:10%
now, most of those people
in some of those contracts

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:10%
are dead.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.808 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or they're
waiting it out.

00:26:39.808 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They're already
dead or dying out.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's done.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And now, time to push.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And the new people
coming on board

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:90%
don't want to take their spot.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.850 align:middle line:90%
They want to give it up.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.190 align:middle line:90%
So that could be the why now.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, David, if it was up to
you and you were in charge,

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:84%
would you be fully transparent
with what the government knows

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.120 align:middle line:84%
about extraterrestrials
and tell mankind about it?

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I'd be so
upfront about it,

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I would do it if it meant people
were going to be executed.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Including myself.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not involved in them.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.810 align:middle line:90%
But if I was in charge, yeah.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Heads are going to roll
if you betrayed us.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get you.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:10%
So yeah.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:25.760 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.902 align:middle line:84%
Every detail-- slop,
nastiness, all of it.

00:27:29.902 --> 00:27:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Regardless
of what would happen?

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Don't care.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Needs to be done.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.650 align:middle line:90%
It's like a bad wound.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.250 align:middle line:90%
We want to put a hot iron to it.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.490 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna cauterize
it, then clean it.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.823 align:middle line:84%
It's going to hurt like hell,
but you just got to do it.

00:27:42.823 --> 00:27:44.115 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Got to get through it.

00:27:44.115 --> 00:27:45.200 align:middle line:90%
How about you, Tim?

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Would you go transparent?

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Would you tell everybody
what the government

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:90%
knows about extraterrestrials?

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I got to laugh about it.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.260 align:middle line:90%
It's radical.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.302 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: He's passionate.

00:27:55.302 --> 00:27:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That's radical.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:90%
That's radical.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:90%
It's like, yeah.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's pray and hope.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:02.848 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I'd go for that.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's good.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, no.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, it's a super
complicated situation.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.415 align:middle line:90%
And it's time relevant.

00:28:16.415 --> 00:28:19.310 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:20.405 align:middle line:90%
Time is ticking.

00:28:20.405 --> 00:28:25.130 align:middle line:84%
It's important that this
Earth gets upgraded in a way.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:84%
It's super complicated,
because you have

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.145 align:middle line:90%
all these political figures.

00:28:31.145 --> 00:28:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Lots involved.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: So many people involved.

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And they all got
their own agendas.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And they all try to put
their own little spices

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.250 align:middle line:84%
in wherever they can, even if
they have their agreements,

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:44.310 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So that makes it very
difficult. And in the end,

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:52.790 align:middle line:84%
it's about making trust,
giving the impression of trust

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and standing in for
the right thing.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I know that Earth in some years
will be a much better place.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather see it in an
even much better place

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.210 align:middle line:84%
by giving much more of the
technology to the public.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:84%
But yet, it's probably
getting better in some ways

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Two groups
you need to destroy.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.510 align:middle line:84%
The what's in it for me
club, and I got mine club.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Exactly.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.018 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Those have
to be done away with.

00:29:24.018 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And the aliens that's left
over through all this mess,

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.350 align:middle line:84%
they might end up
liking you better.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.990 align:middle line:84%
They go, look at that,
the self-regulating,

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:90%
cleaning up human.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: There they go.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Who would have
ever thought of that?

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --their own people.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, who
would have ever thought

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.020 align:middle line:90%
that would happen, you know?

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That's the
reason why humanity

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.450 align:middle line:84%
has one of the highest
evolutionary potentials

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.410 align:middle line:90%
of all species.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That's why they
attract so much attention.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's possible
we could do that.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Each one of us is
connected to this community

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:57.090 align:middle line:90%
field that we are creating.

So if we tap into that and
if we put our best energy

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and if we connect
to better worlds

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and project that outside,
it creates better worlds.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.827 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I totally agree.

00:30:11.827 --> 00:30:14.160 align:middle line:84%
David, I want to thank you
for coming on the show again.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.202 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Thank you.

00:30:15.202 --> 00:30:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And Tim, it's always
a pleasure to have you.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you, Emery.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.180 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FEMALE VOICOVER: Next
on Cosmic Disclosure.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: The next thing
you know, over there

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:84%
on the top of the
mountains where

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:84%
we were doing that project,
there was three craft.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Bright, shiny looking things.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And then three more and
three more pulled up.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's where Jeremiah Davis
was recruited out of Area 51

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.035 align:middle line:84%
into the United Galactic
Federation of Hendon.

00:30:46.035 --> 00:30:49.590 align:middle line:84%
If you start seeing things
so different, it's unreal.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And so you start believing
even though people

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.250 align:middle line:84%
won't believe that there's
more out there than what

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.050 align:middle line:90%
we're being told.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:90%
