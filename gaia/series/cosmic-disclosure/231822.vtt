00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD DOTY: We first
developed the craft with

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.219 align:middle line:84%
the assistance of an
extraterrestrial race.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.130 align:middle line:84%
The original craft, that
was created in 1977,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.450 align:middle line:84%
was made of a type
of outer skin that

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.853 align:middle line:90%
was almost a living organism.

00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:10%
That outer skin was able to
project itself and curve time.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything was pixelated.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was distortion that
made the human body so sick.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.713 align:middle line:84%
It was the most horrifying
experience he had in his life.

00:00:44.713 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH GOLEMBESKE:
So just to be clear,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.090 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
time travel here?

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.795 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: We're
talking about travel.

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:10%
>> JOSH: Project MINOT
isn't just classified.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:10%
It's tied to non-human tech.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:10%
And most people have
never even heard of it.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:10%
Joining me to talk about
it is Richard Doty,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:10%
a former Special Agent
with the Air Force

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:10%
Office of Special Investigations
who worked directly

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.780 align:middle line:10%
with UFO-related intelligence.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm Josh Golembeske, MUFON Field
Investigator and your guest host

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:90%
today of Cosmic Disclosure.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Richard, welcome
back to the show.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Thank you, Josh.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Now, I'm really excited
about this conversation today

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:84%
because this is like
next-level stuff that no other

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:90%
whistleblower is talking about.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So with that being
said, I know there's

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.680 align:middle line:84%
been a lot of talk
and speculation

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:90%
about secret space programs.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is Project MINOT?

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:10%
>> RICHARD: Project MINOT is a
codename for Managed Integrated

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:10%
Navigational
Off-planet Transport.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.800 align:middle line:10%
It pertains to a
craft that we created

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.160 align:middle line:10%
with the assistance of
an extraterrestrial race

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:10%
to travel, not within
our solar system,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:10%
but outside our solar system.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.080 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, so many questions.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start with what
division of our military

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
was responsible
for this program?

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, when it
first started back in 1977,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
the United States Space Command,
with assistance from NASA,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
was involved in the
development for planning this.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:10%
But then DARPA came
in, and they're

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:10%
the ones that went out and got
contractors, US contractors,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.080 align:middle line:10%
to help in the
development of this craft.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, this craft that
we're going to talk about,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.300 align:middle line:84%
referring to MINOT, refers
to just the craft, not

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:84%
the operations to
pilot the craft

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.020 align:middle line:84%
or fly the craft from one
point to another point.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
That's entirely
different programming.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.072 align:middle line:90%
But the MINOT is just the craft.

00:02:54.072 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: How did you find
out this information?

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.432 align:middle line:84%
And why is it being given
to you to tell us today?

00:03:00.432 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Because there's an
astronaut out there that was

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
involved in this program
that flew the MINOT crafts.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:90%
We'll codename him Ben.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:90%
Ben approached me.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:90%
I met Ben a long time ago.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I knew he was involved with
something highly classified,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.700 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't know exactly what.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he
opened up to me.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, although he
never actually came out and told

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
me this, but I'm in the
belief that what he's telling

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.550 align:middle line:90%
me is part of the disclosure.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:90%
And he wants it out.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he's
still in the program,

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and he can't talk
about it on camera.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:90%
So he asked me to do it.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me if I could
relay this information

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:84%
in an environment
that the public could

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:90%
understand or listen to.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm here on
Gaia trying to explain what

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:90%
he told me about this program.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Again, there's a lot
about this program that's

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
so classified that
I don't know about

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:90%
and he's not telling me about.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.982 align:middle line:84%
But the basics,
we can talk about.

00:04:16.982 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're going to do.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:84%
He's been in the program about
17 years, roughly 17 years.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK, wow.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Was this technology
gifted to us?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Or did the ETs actually help
us construct this craft?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.592 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: ETs helped us
to construct this craft.

00:04:31.592 --> 00:04:32.392 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: But It
was an evolution.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:84%
We first developed the
craft with the assistance

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
of an extraterrestrial race,
one particular extraterrestrial

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:84%
non-human that we found
in a crash in 1959.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that
we held in captivity.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And then he decided to help us
in the development of something

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:84%
that we could use to travel
throughout the universe.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, wow.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.940 align:middle line:84%
What particular group or
race was this ET from?

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.085 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: The Pleiadians.

00:05:05.085 --> 00:05:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: It was a Pleiadians?

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yes.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, very interesting.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.440 align:middle line:10%
>> RICHARD: Well, most people
within the UFO community knows

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.360 align:middle line:10%
that a code name for a
particular extraterrestrial that

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:10%
worked out of Area 51.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:90%
And they know it by J-Rod.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: J-Rod.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: J-Rod was a
non-human that assisted us

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
in the creation of
this Project MINOT.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, the
Pleiadians star system

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:90%
had thousands of stars--

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:90%
thousands.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: And so they have
literally thousands of planets.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:84%
We're only dealing
with where J-Rod lived

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and those surrounding planets
within his solar system.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.100 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
any of the other--

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.380 align:middle line:84%
and there may be life
on these other planets.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there's
confusion between when

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:90%
somebody said a Pleiadian.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.587 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a Pleiadian
from another planet.

00:06:00.587 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Sure, yeah.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: And so I'm talking
to a guy that actually had

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle line:90%
an interface.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying that any of
these other stories aren't true,

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.810 align:middle line:84%
but we're only
talking about J-Rod.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
his society and his planet.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So just
for our audience,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to explain a
little more about who J-Rod is

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:90%
and the Pleiadians.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:84%
J-Rod was in a
craft that crashed

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:84%
in 1959, October of 1959, in
Nye County, Nevada, near a mine.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Miners saw the crash.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.910 align:middle line:90%
They went out.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:84%
They found-- they knew it
wasn't a human, live entity.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.700 align:middle line:90%
They call it a creature.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It was needing help.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
The miners had to go back to
their administrative site, which

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
was about 10 or 12 miles
away, get some help.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:84%
But back in 1959, communications
wasn't very, very good.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, they
contacted Nye County Sheriff,

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:84%
who then contacted the Air Force
because Tonopah and Area 51

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:90%
was active then.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
It took them 11 days
to get out there.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:90%
They get out there.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.727 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force
recovered the craft.

00:07:09.727 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:84%
They recovered this
extraterrestrial.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:90%
It was later codenamed J-Rod.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is an entirely
different story,

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.810 align:middle line:90%
why they call him J-Rod.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.820 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, so they have an
extraterrestrial in captivity.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:90%
They already had one.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they had
EBE-1, who died in 1952.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Now J-Rod, different species,
they knew immediately.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.830 align:middle line:90%
The scientists looked at J-Rod.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:90%
It looked similar to a human--

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:90%
bipedal.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:84%
They had arms and legs,
although their eye sockets

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:90%
were different.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.740 align:middle line:90%
They had no eyebrows.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes were a little
bit different than ours.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems
they had immediately

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:90%
was J-Rod couldn't talk.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.220 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't speak English.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.600 align:middle line:90%
He didn't understand it.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't obviously
understand him,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:84%
just similar to what we
went through with EBE-1.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: But over time,
they found that the biologics

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.870 align:middle line:84%
of J-Rod, there were a lot of
similarities to that of a human.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So they figured, well, maybe
he can learn our language.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:90%
We probably couldn't learn his.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So over a period of time-- and I
don't know what that time period

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:90%
was--

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:90%
he learned English.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:84%
He was able to speak it because
of his biologics, his throat.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
His language was more
tones and strange sounds.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.840 align:middle line:84%
But he was able to learn
our English because you

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
got to understand this, their
civilization with thousands

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:90%
of years more advanced than us.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So their mind was they
probably had a 200 IQ

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:84%
level, so they were able to
understand things a lot quicker

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:90%
and faster than we could.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And so they trained--

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:84%
we, the military, trained
J-Rod in our language.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that he was
similar to a human, that

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:90%
made things easier for us.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, once he
understood and could

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:84%
speak our language,
he could then

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:90%
give us a lot of technology.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: A lot of times when
you hear contact between an ET,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:90%
it's always telepathy.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So J-Rod wasn't using his
mind at all to communicate.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:90%
It was all verbal.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Right.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Was there a part of
it that was telepathy as well

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:90%
or no?

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It was just straight
verbal information.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, later on,
there was some thought transfer,

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.457 align:middle line:90%
they would call it.

00:09:35.457 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Thought transfer?

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: But there was a
telepathic communication system

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:84%
that J-Rod was trying to portray
or instill into the humans,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:90%
but they weren't grasping it.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And even before they taught
J-Rod the English language,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:90%
there were some--

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and this would be
another entire episode.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:84%
There were some
particular, I'll just say,

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:84%
people, that he had an interface
with, that they went back

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and said, he's trying to
communicate through my mind.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm reading what he's
saying in my mind.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.780 align:middle line:90%
And they tested him.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:90%
He's communicating.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And they did something
to show that what

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.135 align:middle line:84%
this person, the
human, is receiving

00:10:28.135 --> 00:10:31.760 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what J-Rod wants.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So there was a communication
system through telepathy--

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
only through telepathy--
until he learned English.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:84%
One thing the viewers
have to understand

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.370 align:middle line:84%
is when I was in-- we knew
of five different species

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials
that have visited Earth

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:84%
or we had some form
of contact with.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Some of these could not speak.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.870 align:middle line:90%
They had no voice box.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything was done
through their mind,

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:84%
through consciousness,
thought transfer,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
telepathy, those
paranormal things

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
that we would call paranormal
communications methods.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And so the only way
we could communicate

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:90%
with them is through that.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And we had to learn that
because we didn't know it.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, suddenly, a
extraterrestrial species

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:90%
shows up, and they can't talk.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And we talk, but they
can't understand us.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So you imagine the complexity
of that was back then.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
some that could,

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.220 align:middle line:84%
but they spoke a
different language.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:84%
They spoke in tones or
whatever, like EBE-1 did.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So these things were all
different technologies,

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:90%
all different biologics.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just one.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And I hear so many
people out there

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:84%
within the UFO community
talk about aliens

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:84%
as if there was
just one species.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:90%
There weren't.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:90%
There were at least five.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And I understand
now there's probably

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.070 align:middle line:84%
9 or 10 that we
know of that we've

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:90%
had contact with officially.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So we had to first communicate
something to J-Rod in order

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:90%
for him to communicate with us.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was easier for us
to teach him, I guess,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.550 align:middle line:84%
because we were able to show
him the English language.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, I don't know how
long it took, but he learned it.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to
communicate with us in English

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.570 align:middle line:84%
because, obviously, we
couldn't learn his language.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Right.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But why was J-Rod so willing to
help us develop our technology?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:90%
He crashed here.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
We captured him, but he was
open to just sharing information

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.948 align:middle line:90%
and helping the human race?

00:12:38.948 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Yeah, that's an
entirely different subject.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But because you
brought it up, J-Rod

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:90%
was the only survivor of five.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:90%
There were five in that craft.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Four died.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.960 align:middle line:90%
He was the only survivor.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.396 align:middle line:90%
He's on an alien planet to him.

00:12:58.396 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:90%
He's in trouble.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know exactly
if he was injured or what.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
part of the story,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:84%
but he has comrades inside his
craft that were dead or died.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:15.212 align:middle line:84%
And so he had to
cooperate in some way.

00:13:15.212 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:84%
If you put yourself
on an alien planet,

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.827 align:middle line:84%
you've got to ask for
help some way or another.

00:13:19.827 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Sure, yeah.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: And
that's what he did.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why he decided
to help us all these years

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:90%
because that was in 1959.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And to the best of my
knowledge, although--

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know everything, but
the best of my knowledge, J-Rod

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:84%
is still alive and well, living
someplace within the Nellis Test

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:90%
and Training Range.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: And
obviously, he has to be--

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I think he has to
have some assistance

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:84%
in some environmental reason
because his planet had

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:84%
a different atmosphere
or something like that.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.998 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was told.

00:13:53.998 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm not an
expert in that area.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.850 align:middle line:84%
I just know that if
I was in his shoes,

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I would have to
learn the language,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.310 align:middle line:84%
cooperate, and assist
as much as I can.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
reasons that J-Rod

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:84%
wanted to help us create
something is to take him home.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So back to
the craft itself,

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I imagine this is obviously
not a conventional craft.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:84%
What sets it apart in like
design and capabilities

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:84%
from conventional
type human vehicles?

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, first
of all, the craft,

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:90%
which was codenamed Cronus--

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Cronus is--

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Cronus?

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Cronus is the god
of time in Greek mythology.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know who named
it, but somebody did.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason why
that we can discuss later.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.970 align:middle line:84%
The craft, the
original craft, it

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:84%
was-- that was created in
1977, Cronus, just Cronus,

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.550 align:middle line:84%
was made of a type
of outer skin that

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:90%
was almost a living organism.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
extraterrestrial contribution

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:90%
to that craft.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:10%
That outer skin was able to
project itself and curve time.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's probably 1,000
questions right there of how--

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:84%
number 1, did we-- or how
did they give us this?

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And how does it work with
anything that we have?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Because part of this craft,
because humans actually

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
had to fly the craft, had to
be made of human technology.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.970 align:middle line:84%
But parts of it was made with
extraterrestrial technology,

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:84%
or at least Pleiadian
technology that

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
was able to project
it to a point in space

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:90%
where it could find a portal--

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:50.480 align:middle line:84%
portal opening-- and then flying
through that portal from point A

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:84%
to point B. And that's
done through the skin

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.580 align:middle line:84%
of the craft, which,
as we were told,

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:90%
was like a living organism.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
other than biological.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like a third quantum type
of substance that can think

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and interact with consciousness
because, eventually,

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:84%
at some time-- and we'll
talk about it later--

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:84%
that the astronauts
are flying these crafts

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.650 align:middle line:84%
through their
consciousness, interfacing

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:84%
with the outer skin of that
craft, which is, again, a living

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
organism.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, they
were using controls,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.950 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with the skin
because the craft could not

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:84%
do what we would want it to do
or what J-Rod wanted it to do

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.060 align:middle line:90%
for us without the outer skin.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the main
part of that craft

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
that propels it through these
portals is the outer skin.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.173 align:middle line:90%
And that had to be done--

00:16:57.173 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:84%
that had to be created
by the Pleiadians

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't have the
technology in 1977 to do that.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So the first craft
had the outer skin,

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
but the interior was more human
because humans had to fly it.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: You mentioned that the
skin can somehow curve space

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.857 align:middle line:90%
time and find portals.

00:17:17.857 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell me more about that?

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, it's
not just the skin.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:90%
We have to go back a little bit.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:84%
J-Rod gave us something else
from the craft that he crashed

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:90%
in the desert of Nevada.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And there were devices
that he took out or told

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.950 align:middle line:84%
them to take out that were able
to be used inside that craft.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just the skin,
but it was another device.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
This other device was a
four-vector longitudinal pathway

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
device that interfaced with the
skin that allowed this craft

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:84%
to be steered towards
these portals that

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.140 align:middle line:90%
were located in space.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:10%
And so the skin, in
conjunction with this device,

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:10%
this four-vector
longitudinal pathway--

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:10%
and that's our
description of it.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not obviously
J-Rod's description.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: We're able
together to find these portals.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, how exactly we
did that, I don't know.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And he never explained that.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But again, our technology
at that time in 1977

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.380 align:middle line:84%
hasn't advanced to the
point where we could

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:90%
understand alien technology.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you consider that
Pleiadians or the Ebens who--

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:84%
of course, the Ebens
was found in the 1947

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.850 align:middle line:84%
craft, the craft that was
crashed at Roswell or Corona.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.200 align:middle line:90%
We didn't understand that craft.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.790 align:middle line:84%
We didn't understand
that technology.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, jumping ahead
in 1959 when we

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.560 align:middle line:84%
found this other craft,
the Pleiadian craft,

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:90%
entirely different technology.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.240 align:middle line:84%
These aliens don't have
the same technologies.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
They come from
different star groups.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.930 align:middle line:90%
They're different biologics.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.430 align:middle line:84%
They have different
technologies.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have this other
craft that we have no idea

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:84%
because we compared that
craft to the Eben craft.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And we found, wow, these
are totally different.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, wow.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Now we have
to advance our technology

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.480 align:middle line:84%
to a point where
we can understand.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
taken so long to do that.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.198 align:middle line:84%
And we did this with
the assistance of J-Rod.

00:19:19.198 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Let's get back
into these portals.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So the craft
approaches a portal.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Are these portals like
natural phenomenon

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:84%
just spread out
through the universe?

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Or is there any evidence
that they were engineered

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:90%
by a race like the Pleiadians?

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: One of the
things J-Rod gave us was a--

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:84%
the simplest explanation
I can give you

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
here is a star map, a map
that we had to understand.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
background about how

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.230 align:middle line:90%
we could understand it.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Where did we use the
old Apollo system,

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
which there is indication that
we might have had more space

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:10.050 align:middle line:84%
launches to test portals
even in the early '70s?

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And also, maybe the
Russians used it in Kosmos

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
to try to get near a portal to
look and see what it was like.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:24.000 align:middle line:84%
But what we did
was we knew based--

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:84%
eventually, after we figured
out what this star map was

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system,
where these points were,

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and so what we had to do was
propel a craft to that point.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
got to that point,

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:84%
the skin of the craft
and this other device,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.170 align:middle line:84%
the longitudinal pathway device,
saw out that path, that portal,

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.920 align:middle line:90%
and propelled the craft into it.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: OK, I want to get
into what happened once you go

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.020 align:middle line:90%
into the portal.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But to be clear,
when you say there

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:84%
was a map of these portals,
is that natural portals?

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have any-- or
is it engineered portals?

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: I don't know
whether it was engineered.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.900 align:middle line:84%
That's a good
question, whether--

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.910 align:middle line:90%
who made these portals?

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: I think there
were probably natural.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm guessing here.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say something
that I'm not sure about,

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just guessing that there
are probably natural portals.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.740 align:middle line:90%
They're out there.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:84%
You think of the
vastness of the universe.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:84%
It would be almost impossible
to make these things.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But then again, I
don't know that.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think they
were something that

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:33.610 align:middle line:84%
was out there that these
star travelers figured out

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.320 align:middle line:90%
or maybe they did engineer it.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.200 align:middle line:84%
But then again,
that's a good question

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.522 align:middle line:90%
that I just can't answer.

00:21:38.522 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: OK, so you
touched on it a little bit.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%
But once the craft
approaches these portals,

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.370 align:middle line:84%
how does it activate the portal
and get ready to actually go on,

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.170 align:middle line:90%
go through it?

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Is it a wormhole?

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.272 align:middle line:90%
What are we talking about here?

00:21:49.272 --> 00:21:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Yeah, that's a
good analogy there-- wormhole.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:90%
As Ben explained to me--

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and he went through
these things--

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:84%
there were pathways or
navigational directions.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you speak to an
astronaut today that

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:84%
has traveled outside the
solar system, most of them--

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.210 align:middle line:84%
the old ones are
dead-- but they'll

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.190 align:middle line:84%
tell you that we know
coordinates in space.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And so this skin of
the craft that could

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:84%
curve time, and then this other
device, the pathway device,

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:84%
directs the craft to
a particular point.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:84%
As it gets to that
point, that portal opens.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why or how.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.580 align:middle line:90%
He never went into that.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we probably know, and
it's probably highly classified.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So once the craft gets
to that portal, it opens.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the problem.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Once these-- our astronauts, two
in a craft, the Cronus craft,

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:84%
once we got in there, and
once we got to that portal,

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:90%
it will open.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's all sorts
of physiological effects

00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:59.610 align:middle line:90%
that occurs on the astronaut.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But one of the problems is
that once we enter that portal,

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
where they're going.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:84%
They're entering A, and
they don't know where B is.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.805 align:middle line:84%
So they're almost going
through-- in the early stages,

00:23:12.805 --> 00:23:13.605 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:13.605 --> 00:23:16.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the early
experimental stage.

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.630 align:middle line:84%
They go through
this, and they don't

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:90%
know where they're ending up.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: That's terrifying.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Yeah,
very terrifying.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What happens in that
physical tunnel from point

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:90%
A to point B?

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.057 align:middle line:90%
And how is time experienced?

00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Good question.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, as they enter,
the astronauts-- now,

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
remember, in the early
days, they weren't prepared

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.810 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know
that J-Rod could explain

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:84%
or knew how a human would
react to this portal

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:84%
because it's almost
like a time machine

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:90%
as it was explained to me.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Because when you go through
it, there's an event horizon,

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:84%
just like if you're
entering a black hole,

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:90%
but everything is pixelated.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
What he explained, it was the
most horrifying experience

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:90%
he had in his life.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.350 align:middle line:90%
And he went through--

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:90%
he was a fighter pilot.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And he went through all the
sorts of astronaut training.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.832 align:middle line:84%
But no, they never trained
the astronauts for this.

00:24:15.832 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: How could you?

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Everything
was pixelated.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was distortion that
made the human body so sick.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And it happened for
a period of time.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're on linear
time period because there

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:84%
was no time recorded
in this craft

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.710 align:middle line:90%
because there's just nothing.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.570 align:middle line:90%
There's no time.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.610 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine
there's no time.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:42.780 align:middle line:84%
But as they get to the end of
that portal or coming out of it,

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
everything goes back to normal,
at least somewhat normal.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Now, they're outside.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.810 align:middle line:84%
When they exit that portal,
they're going a great--

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:90%
they're going a great speed.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what that speed is.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And it takes-- well, it took the
human astronauts a time period

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.770 align:middle line:84%
to adjust after going
through that portal.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And when they get out,
then they realized

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.108 align:middle line:90%
that they are in the future.

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So just to be clear,
we're talking about time travel

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.308 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: We're talking
about time travel.

00:25:15.308 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: All right, before we
get to where they end up going,

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I want to know a little bit
more about this, I guess,

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:84%
tunnel or this wormhole
they're in for a second.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:84%
What else happens
to the astronauts

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:84%
when they're
physically in there?

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.983 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that
they're disoriented

00:25:27.983 --> 00:25:29.300 align:middle line:90%
and that they don't feel well.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there physical, emotional--
is their even spiritual effects

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:84%
to that transition
or that journey?

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, one thing he
told me was when he first went

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:42.690 align:middle line:84%
through it, the first thing he
did was trying to look at his

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:43.490 align:middle line:90%
body, his hands.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:90%
He can't see 'em.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.130 align:middle line:90%
All you see is pixelization.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Now, if you've
never experienced that or never

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:84%
trained to cope with it,
it could drive you crazy.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And he said it made--

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:02.860 align:middle line:84%
although he was-- he said it--
a pretty down-to-earth person,

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:84%
didn't look at fright as being
something that would affect him,

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:90%
but he was scared to death.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:90%
His mind couldn't operate.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:90%
It just couldn't think.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things
I asked him was, well,

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:90%
how long did it last?

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, I'm
trying to relate time.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:20.270 align:middle line:90%
He says, I don't know.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.555 align:middle line:84%
I just know that eventually,
we came out of it.

00:26:22.555 --> 00:26:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: He's freaking out.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Because we thought--

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.110 align:middle line:84%
because there was only two
astronauts, him and another one

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.250 align:middle line:90%
in this craft.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:84%
He said, I actually thought
we were going to die.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:84%
I thought we already were dead
because you can't see anything.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't even know
if I can imagine that.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:47.130 align:middle line:84%
But your body felt
very heavy, he said.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.100 align:middle line:90%
They were seated in their chair.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And they were strapped in.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't know
what would have happened

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.770 align:middle line:90%
if they weren't strapped in.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, after they got out--

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:90%
again, it took him some time.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we went back to
recording Earth-based time.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:84%
It took like hours and
hours to adjust their bodies

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:90%
back to normal.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Then, they
realized they got a mission.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:15.790 align:middle line:90%
They got to take over.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
They got to realize what
they're doing, where they're at,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.987 align:middle line:90%
and function back as astronauts.

00:27:21.987 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Well, it's fascinating.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
First of all, seat belts are
important in wormholes, as well

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:90%
as highways.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:84%
They must have had a test
mission to start this off with.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.900 align:middle line:84%
What was the first thing they
tried to do with the Cronus 1,

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:90%
they call it?

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Cronus 1?

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Well, Cronus then.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Cronus?

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Just Cronus.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: They flew a
mission from Earth to the moon.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Then, later on, they
went through a portal.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
In 1980, they actually
went through the portal.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: How did they know
how to get back not just

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
to the location they were
at, but also in time?

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:84%
If they were time traveling,
I'd be terrified that I'd be--

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:84%
I could never get back to my
present time with my family

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.730 align:middle line:90%
and friends.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Excellent question.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.580 align:middle line:84%
What they did was
in the early days,

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.723 align:middle line:84%
they created something
called the quantum cord.

00:28:08.723 --> 00:28:09.523 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:28:09.523 --> 00:28:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Now, the cord was
always used to bring the craft

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.840 align:middle line:84%
back after they went
through the portal.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not sure how
this cord worked, but we--

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things
that was on our mind

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.940 align:middle line:84%
when the craft was
created through DARPA

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and these other contractors was
that question you just said.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It was, OK, we're going
to propel these astronauts

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:84%
through this time portal
or these time warp

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.500 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:90%
How are they going to get back?

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So J-Rod said, I got an
explanation for that--

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.320 align:middle line:90%
something we used.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not sure
exactly how they did this

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:55.320 align:middle line:84%
or what it involved, but
J-Rod said, OK, here's

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:90%
what you need to do.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is somehow-- we created
this quantum cord to bring us

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.440 align:middle line:84%
back to the portal
that we exited,

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:84%
so we could go back through
the same way we came out.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's roughly what
he explained to me.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot more probably
to that that he did and is

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.280 align:middle line:84%
probably classified or something
he's not going to talk about

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.370 align:middle line:84%
because I have 1,000
questions to ask too.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.190 align:middle line:90%
OK, you got this quantum cord.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:90%
You go through this portal.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Now you're 1,000 or 10,000
or 40,000 or 80,000 years

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:90%
Where's this quantum cord?

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:35.925 align:middle line:84%
Is it connected
to that exit or--

00:29:35.925 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't know.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Those are the
questions I would ask.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.085 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't answer them.

00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But there's obviously
some way to do it

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:50.670 align:middle line:84%
because these crafts always came
back even though they went--

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and it would take maybe two to
four to six months Earth time.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.700 align:middle line:90%
They always came back.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:90%
So you didn't go out--

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and this is another question
because a lot of people

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:02.880 align:middle line:90%
know I teach math.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And some of the equations
that I can deal with is, OK,

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:12.320 align:middle line:84%
if you go through this portal,
and it takes however long

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.010 align:middle line:84%
a period, even if it's a linear
time period, and you come out,

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and you're 40,000
years into the future,

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and you stay three
or four months,

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and then you go back
and come back through,

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I would think that our time
period would have advanced

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.115 align:middle line:90%
farther than that.

00:30:32.115 --> 00:30:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Right, yeah.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: But it doesn't.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.690 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem to because he
said, no, it doesn't do that.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:40.210 align:middle line:84%
There's some-- I
don't know something

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that we know that
he's not telling

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.065 align:middle line:90%
or maybe he doesn't even know.

00:30:44.065 --> 00:30:47.560 align:middle line:84%
But he says, you go through, and
it's like a month or two months.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:90%
And you come back through.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you come back
through a couple of months,

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.940 align:middle line:90%
you've been gone a couple--

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I think a year was the most
they've ever been gone.

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But you come back, and
a year has advanced.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.040 align:middle line:84%
But another question
that I have--

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and this is fascinating,
I think-- is aging.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Do you age?

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Because you look at Einstein's
theory, theory of relativity

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and all the different
theories that Einstein has.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.942 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go
into all of them.

00:31:20.942 --> 00:31:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to do
that, Einstein would say,

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:27.810 align:middle line:84%
you didn't age, but everybody
else would have aged.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:29.730 align:middle line:90%
But that didn't happen in this.

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the big question of
why there must be more to it

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:39.540 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know about
that they know about.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: All right, Rick,
the next question I have is,

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.850 align:middle line:84%
where were they
going in the future?

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: What if I was
to tell you they went 4,000,

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:51.290 align:middle line:84%
40,000, and 80,000
years into the future?

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.780 align:middle line:84%
But of course, that's
for the next episode.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: All right.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to dive in.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.958 align:middle line:84%
Well, thanks, Rick,
again for being here.

00:31:57.958 --> 00:31:59.250 align:middle line:90%
This was an incredible episode.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward to
continuing this conversation.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: It's
great being here.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: My name
is Josh Golembeske.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:08.570 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you next time.
