00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure"

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:84%
we're with Sergeant
Clifford Stone, who

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.640 align:middle line:84%
has amazing personal experiences
with extraterrestrials

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:90%
in the military.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Stone,
welcome to the show.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD STONE: Thank you.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be here.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Sarge, many
people out there

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.760 align:middle line:90%
are claiming ETs are amongst us.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Are they?

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.178 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I actually
know that to be

00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:84%
true through
personal experiences.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:10%
Korona, I remember his
name, because he's going

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:10%
to be with me throughout life.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.998 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes he
creates problems for me.

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Well, what's your
involvement with that?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.332 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: He's learning from me.

00:00:52.332 --> 00:00:55.600 align:middle line:10%
And there's thousands
of people out there

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:10%
that have a
companion, I'll put it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:10%
that way, that's going to
follow them throughout life.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And once again,
they're among us.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to go into
a social event with me.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I know of at least two other
people who've seen him.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:84%
In one instance, it saved
that individual's life.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:90%
But you know, they're not--

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.390 align:middle line:90%
that's not the purpose.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:84%
They're learning from
your experiences.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I can go ahead, look at
this document, page by page,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and even if I'm not reading
it, he can actually pick up

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:90%
on everything that's there.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:90%
And he will fully remember.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
everything I see--

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
like when I'm going through
my documents, they see.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
One instance was
that I had contact

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%
with some people who, they
look very much like you and me,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:90%
very normal.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.405 align:middle line:90%
We talked.

00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And they had talked
about things.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.447 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering,
gee, where did they

00:01:58.447 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
get all their knowledge about
certain things about space,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
about our solar system, the
manipulation of space time?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And they finally told me that,
we're not from your planet.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:84%
But we are trying to learn
from interaction with people

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:90%
like you, and even others.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
But you know something
strange about us.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, I knew when
we turned the lights off

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:84%
and they could go ahead
and touch something

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and they could tell you
the color of that object,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:84%
then they'd go into
detail explaining

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.213 align:middle line:84%
about the reflection
of light actually

00:02:33.213 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
determines the
color of something.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But the vibration of
the object or whatever

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:84%
also will reflect the color
when there is no light

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:90%
to reflect the color.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I'm doing
it in layman's terms,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
struggling, trying
to explain that.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
They did it in very
scientific terms.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So I had contact with these
people for almost two weeks.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Sarge, where
was this situation?

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: This place was right
outside of Anniston, Alabama.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was sent there
to attend another TDY

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:90%
for some additional training.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Please explain what
a TDY is for the audience.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: TDY is temporary duty.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:10%
Once again, it was at
Fort McClellan Alabama.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.840 align:middle line:90%
We were introduced.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So the whole situation
is, it wasn't by accident.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.583 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How was
that experience?

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: It was weird.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.532 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, I thought
you're pulling my leg,

00:03:25.532 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:90%
you know, this can't be real.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, actually we
found out, and they said,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:84%
you know, well, you know,
we have certain talents.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And someday your species
will have these same talents,

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
evolution that takes

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:84%
place over a period
of time things happen.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Like right now, you
have the ability

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:84%
to do certain things with
your psychic ability.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.910 align:middle line:84%
The reason you
don't use it now is

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:84%
that you're so accustomed
to telling yourself

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
that you can't, that these
psychic abilities don't exist.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
You cannot see things
into the future.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
You cannot go ahead and
pick up on certain things.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But of course, it
can be something

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.195 align:middle line:90%
that would be bothersome also.

00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
get to the point

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.903 align:middle line:84%
where you can go ahead and
have an understanding of what

00:04:14.903 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:84%
the other person's
thinking and, you know,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
they might be thinking
very bad things about you,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and that may bother you and
that may lead to an argument

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
without fully understanding
how it actually occurred.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.457 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they were pointing
out all this stuff.

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How was it
like communicating

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.850 align:middle line:90%
with these beings?

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, they'd go ahead
and show you by haphazard

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:84%
to show you that they can
actually read your mind.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But they're so-- not to draw
attention from other people,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle line:84%
they would talk just like you
and I. The only difference

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
is whatever language
you were talking,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:84%
they were very much
at home with it.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to speak Mandarin
Chinese, they could do that.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.588 align:middle line:84%
Now you know, with us we have
to go in and learn the language

00:04:58.588 --> 00:04:59.880 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to take us time.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we don't
even get to the point

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
where we can really
learn the language where

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:90%
we can say it exactly.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Like I mean, a lot of people
say, OK, I speak English.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But we abuse it
so much, we're not

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:84%
speaking English the
actually the way we should.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:84%
We no longer call it the
King or Queen's English.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:84%
We call it colloquial
English is how we speak.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, they could do either way.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.767 align:middle line:84%
So the situation is if
they were sitting there

00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and you were looking
at them, and them, they

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:84%
were looking at you, and
if they were just speaking

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.743 align:middle line:84%
and they could do it that
way, through thought transfer.

00:05:36.743 --> 00:05:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could
they use telepathy?

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Oh, yeah.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And psionics?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
That's what they refer
to as thought transfer.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But if they do that, then people
say, why are those people just

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
looking at one another
and from time to time,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:90%
like this, are but not talking?

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's going on there?

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So this way it didn't
draw suspicion.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And they had to fit in
wherever they were at.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.640 align:middle line:84%
The only time they
didn't fit in is

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:84%
like I say when you
turn the lights off

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and they could tell you the
colors of certain things.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And you turn the
lights off when it's

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:84%
a very dark room, you can't
see your hand in front of you.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.032 align:middle line:84%
You're going to bump into
things and run into things.

00:06:17.032 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to do that.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Sarge, what
did you learn from them?

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I wasn't
astute scientifically as

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.480 align:middle line:90%
what these people were.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And they would try to
explain things to me,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and like you would try
to explain to a child.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Because if they talked
in heavy technical terms,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.970 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't understand.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way
they related to me.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, we'd
talk about, you know,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
where you from,
how's your family,

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:84%
things normally people just
generically talk about.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: At what
point did you realize

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:90%
they were extraterrestrial?

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: From day one, from
the time they came there.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I knew
that was that they asked--

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:84%
they actually asked about
what went through my mind

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:90%
when I helped that woman escape.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm setting back, how
do they know about that?

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do
you mean escape?

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, there at
Fort Belvoir, Virginia,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:84%
we went ahead and we had
one ET that we recovered

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.530 align:middle line:90%
from a craft or something.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:90%
It was all by itself.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:90%
They guarded it.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.732 align:middle line:90%
They tried to talk to it.

00:07:27.732 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't talk to it.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What kind
of extraterrestrial?

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.818 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Once again, this
was one of the grays.

00:07:32.818 --> 00:07:34.880 align:middle line:84%
But it'd be what we
call type 3 gray.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a taller
one, about four foot tall.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What's a type 1, 2?

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Type 1
is roughly three,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:84%
three and a half foot
tall, a very dark gray.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Type 2, about the same
size, looking very similar

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle line:84%
to the type 1, only
it's a lighter gray.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.183 align:middle line:84%
Their technological level
of knowledge, I don't know.

00:07:59.183 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:90%
Is there a difference?

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there is.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.597 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
sentient beings?

00:08:02.597 --> 00:08:03.512 align:middle line:90%
Are they conscious?

00:08:03.512 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Or is it a program life form?

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there cybernetic--
you know, is there

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
circuitry with organic tissue or
is it just like a human being?

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: No, these entities
are 100% biological entities.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say, OK, they're
born of a mom and dad.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.050 align:middle line:84%
They were brought
up in a family.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:90%
They're just like us.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Now that being said, I need
to point out at this time

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.850 align:middle line:90%
also that there are certain--

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and we'd call it
artificial intelligence.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Only the artificial intelligence
that we're referring to that

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
sometimes appears and looks like
an intelligent life when it is.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to really
put this in the term.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:90%
But the intelligence that are--

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and this is old
technology for them--

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:84%
because initially this
mechanical biological

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, that was actually
initially sent here before man

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:10.070 align:middle line:84%
was even here to seek out
other life in the universes,

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:90%
and even in other dimensions.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.170 align:middle line:90%
They have a conscience.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They have a realization
of their existence.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:84%
They have a realization
that at some point

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:28.590 align:middle line:84%
that existence is going to end,
that artificial intelligence

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:34.140 align:middle line:84%
that is so lifelike that it has
all the emotions of a sentient

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.110 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So tell me about
the escape, I mean exactly.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, when they
took me there, I went ahead

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't communicate.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.273 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
choice of the entity.

00:09:47.273 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to try to get
through this real quick,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:84%
because I get
emotional about it.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:84%
When I went there,
they told me, OK--

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and this is, once again, the
guy always called the Colonel--

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:84%
he says, we have one of
the beings back here,

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and no one can get him to talk
or understand what's going on.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we need you here.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:10%
Fort Belvoir, Virginia has
an Air Force unit there

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:10%
who is directly responsible
for all the activities dealing

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:10%
with real UFO, real
interplanetary craft events.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And they report directly back
to the Air Force's Office

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.540 align:middle line:84%
of Scientific
Intelligence, who reports

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
directly back to the
CIA's Office of Scientific

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they holding
these extraterrestrials

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:90%
there are against their will?

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Now when
I went there, they

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
told me that this entity was
a guest of the United States

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.720 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Yet this entity was under heavy
guard and the situation, when

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I went in and saw the
entity and-- remember

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:84%
when they start to
talk to you, you're

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.030 align:middle line:90%
feeling what they're feeling.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.462 align:middle line:90%
It's an emotional language.

00:10:58.462 --> 00:11:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: There's an
emotional bond-- yes.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So when I went
in, he went ahead.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:90%
He's looking down like this.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Then he raised his head and
looked up at me like that.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And right off the bat, I could
feel him saying, I am afraid.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Now of him saying, I
am afraid immediately,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I was getting visions in
my mind of his family,

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.920 align:middle line:84%
of him fearing not
seeing his family again.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Also of the destruction
that was going

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to happen when his people,
who were already on their way

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
there to get him,
and they would have

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and use the
technology that they

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
had that would totally
destroy that building

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and probably would kill some of
us that was in that building.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't want
that to happen.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
He would much rather
prefer that his death occur

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.490 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to having us
people, who did not know what

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:90%
we were doing, have us killed.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Selfless.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: So I picked up
on it and I let him know,

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.540 align:middle line:90%
we'll get you out of here.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And he made it
clear that he would

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:84%
have to be outside the
perimeter fence line.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way he put
it, perimeter fence line.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So I asked to go back
out to smoke a cigar.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And while I was out there
I told one of my friends

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:84%
if he would mind going
getting a pair of wire cutters

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and slip it in back
of the back fence.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:84%
There was one gate that led
back to where the building was.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And you'd go through
that one gate.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:90%
There is no other gates.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The building itself had a front
entrance and a back entrance.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, I went ahead and
told the person I always

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:84%
called the Colonel,
he's got something

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:90%
he wants to demonstrate to me.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't want
no one else here.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:90%
It's for my eyes, my eyes only.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.570 align:middle line:84%
But then I can explain
it to you and maybe even

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:84%
have some evidence about
what we were talking about.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And the Colonel reluctantly
agreed to move everyone out

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.380 align:middle line:90%
of the building.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And when they
moved everyone out,

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I went ahead, got our entity,
and I said, OK, let's go.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And we ran like crazy to
that back door, went out.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was cutting like
crazy the wire back there.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So I got it to where I could go
ahead, put my body between it

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and push it up this way so
he could crawl under it.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:90%
So I cut myself.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know how it is with
this storm gauge wire that

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:84%
goes around bases, I cut myself
because I couldn't hold it

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:90%
without it hitting me.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But I could hear the people,
the guards yelling, halt,

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to shoot,
halt, we're going to shoot.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear them locking
and loading their weapons.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.060 align:middle line:84%
When he got out, they went
ahead, and he looked up

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.250 align:middle line:90%
and the craft came over.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, all this happened
in the twinkling of an eye.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
bright, and it's

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.690 align:middle line:90%
hard to explain that light.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like a very bright
ray of sunshine shining

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:90%
in a dark hole in the ground.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.628 align:middle line:84%
And you're in there and
you're back in the dark

00:14:16.628 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
but you can see that
ray of sunshine.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.037 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Was it gold light or--

00:14:20.037 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Gold light.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Gold-- you got it.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.928 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've never been
asked that question but you

00:14:24.928 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:90%
got it right on the nose.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.040 align:middle line:90%
It was gold like light.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And he vanished and
the light went off.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, this only
took the twinkling

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:90%
of an eye for that to happen.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the guards
came and grabbed me.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't trying
to be easy with me.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:90%
They pulled me out.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And the guy I always called
the Colonel was telling me

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:84%
how wrong I was, how I could be
court martialed and all that,

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and how I could have wound up
dying that night because they

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:90%
could have shot me.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:84%
The use of deadly
force was authorized.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.505 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah,
but you know what?

00:14:56.505 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I got here and
you told me he was

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:90%
a guest of the US government.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Since when have we been putting
armed guards on our guests?

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to
give me the spiel,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.910 align:middle line:84%
it was for their protection,
or for the entity's protection.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, if that entity
tried to break on his own,

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.518 align:middle line:84%
you're telling me you
would not have shot him?

00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Then he thought about
it for a little while

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and made a little sheepish
laugh and says, well,

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:90%
next time tell me.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I may agree or I may
disagree but we're

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:84%
going to be on the
same sheet of music.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Tell me the next time.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have to trust me.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.430 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, sir.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.840 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to know that I care

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:84%
about all humanity
and all living things,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
have to trust me.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not going to be a
part of a situation of thinking

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:84%
that this entity is
a cartoon character.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to kill one of them,

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be me first.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's very honorable.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: That's a hard
story for me to tell.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Because what people
don't understand

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:84%
when you tell any of these
stories, in your mind's eye

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.700 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing it all over
and you're reliving it.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're reliving
it emotionally as well.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't the craft just come
in and beam the person out

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:28.840 align:middle line:90%
of the jail cell?

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, this
was a building.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
This was a room he
was in, no windows,

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:90%
that one door leading into it.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But if they went ahead, the
beam they were going to be using

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
would go ahead and have like
anti-matter meeting matter.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And it would have an interaction
with the building itself,

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
in that room, which
would ultimately

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:58.740 align:middle line:84%
lead to a massive explosion
with the beam being

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:90%
focused on the entity itself.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the only thing
that would survive that effort

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.787 align:middle line:90%
to recover him.

00:17:08.787 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So he was looking
out for our protection

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:84%
more than anything, and even
willing to take his life.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, I've seen
where they've actually

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:90%
hit a building.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And the situation as you
go in, what was here?

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:90%
There was something here.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But there's no-- like
we blow up something,

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:90%
you got all kinds of debris.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:31.400 align:middle line:84%
All you have is about like
a fine powder, if that much.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was the
Colonel actually aware

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
of how dangerous it is to
keep an extraterrestrial

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:90%
on lockdown?

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Do they know, or do they
actually want it to happen.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:47.977 align:middle line:84%
They want the craft to come
back and get their person back?

00:17:47.977 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They don't
want it to happen,

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
but there's a protocol
where we always

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.850 align:middle line:84%
return the living entities and
we always return the bodies.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.560 align:middle line:90%
But there's a protocol.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:84%
But before that
protocol is met they

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:84%
will always try to get
as much information

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:84%
from a living
entity as possible.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: We always were told--

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and of course, living entities
are worth a lot more money

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.190 align:middle line:90%
than a dead entity.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's so true.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Oh, yes, I would agree.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So this escaped
extraterrestrial obviously

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:90%
got back to his family.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Correct.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
other families

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.260 align:middle line:84%
visiting here from
other civilizations,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.420 align:middle line:90%
that you're aware of?

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
The situation is when
I went to Germany--

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and that was a time I was
there for eight years--

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.610 align:middle line:84%
I had a SFC, Sergeant
First Class, E-7,

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:90%
who was the NCOIC of SPOO.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:10%
SPOO stands for Security
Plans and Operations Office.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.495 align:middle line:10%
He went ahead and felt
that was necessary, says,

00:18:48.495 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:10%
well, you know, you
had that experience

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:10%
there at Fort McClellan
with this family that

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.400 align:middle line:10%
was not of this planet.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not uncommon
for this to happen.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:84%
In case it happens
again, you need

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
to know that they're not
the only family here.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Says, there was one instance--
and I need to tell you this

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and I've been
directed to do so--

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.240 align:middle line:90%
there was a family.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
Brownsville, Texas, because it

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:84%
was near the Gulf, where they
had a hurricane that came in.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
damaging hurricane.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm being told this in 1978.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And it destroyed a whole
lot of property there.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, one of the teenage
boys that was among the family

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.430 align:middle line:84%
felt sorry for this one
girl because her family

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:90%
lost everything.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you
know, we have ways

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:84%
of dealing with these types
of storms on our planet

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.202 align:middle line:90%
where they don't do any damage.

00:19:53.202 --> 00:19:55.680 align:middle line:84%
He said, on your
planet, he says,

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.085 align:middle line:90%
yes, well, how'd you get here?

00:19:57.085 --> 00:20:01.720 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, you people
call them flying saucers.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And says, if it make you
a little bit more happier,

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:84%
if it'd make your
life a little easier,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.280 align:middle line:84%
with you having to
go through all this,

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.280 align:middle line:84%
would you like to see my
family's flying saucer?

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh my.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.413 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: And she you went ahead.

00:20:18.413 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:90%
You have it here.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.890 align:middle line:90%
It says, yes.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Says, tomorrow I'll bring
you over to my home.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're in the barn is the
flying saucer that we came here

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So she went ahead says, well,
yes, I'd like to see that.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
But all through the
night other people

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.380 align:middle line:84%
saw these military
Air Force blue vans,

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Air Force blue tractor
trailers, cars going there

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next day, he
didn't go get this girl.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.150 align:middle line:90%
She told her family.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.012 align:middle line:84%
The family told some of the
other people around there.

00:20:57.012 --> 00:20:59.910 align:middle line:84%
The sheriff there finally
found out about it.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Everything during the
course of the night,

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
the family, everything
they owned was taken out.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:84%
In the barn, there was evidence
that something very heavy

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.790 align:middle line:84%
was in that barn
sitting on the ground,

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.490 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't there now.

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And the big question was,
how did they get it out?

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And how did-- because there is
no flat bed that anyone that

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:34.890 align:middle line:84%
saw a flatbed with
a tarpaulin over it.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
It was just like,
you know, trucks

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:84%
you normally use
to move furniture

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:90%
and things of this sort.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.290 align:middle line:84%
But everything was
moved out, the stuff

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:84%
that was in the barn and
some of the other buildings

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:90%
where the family had things.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:84%
They went ahead and
nothing was there.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'll go so far to
say if somebody dropped

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
a nickel on the floor during
the time, it was even picked up.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And the place was left like
they'd left and cleaned it out

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and cleaned the
floors and everything.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use
the word sterile,

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:84%
like it was ready for
somebody else to move in.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And no one knew where
the family went.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.722 align:middle line:90%
Now he told me where they went.

00:22:18.722 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:90%
They went to California.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They went
to California?

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: They went to Cal--

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.883 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't give me the
destination where they went.

00:22:23.883 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:84%
He says, but they took the
whole family to California.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the young
man was told, you know,

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:84%
the people of this planet
are not going to understand.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And if one person finds out
that we're not of this world,

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.260 align:middle line:84%
it's going to spook
them enough to where

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:90%
they may talk to other people.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And that will ultimately
lead to other people coming

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:84%
here and maybe even
killing the entire family,

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:84%
because of that very
human factor that we

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:90%
fear the unknown.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And with that fear,
the only way we

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.300 align:middle line:84%
know how to deal with
it is try to destroy

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.760 align:middle line:90%
that which we don't understand.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:84%
My takeaway on that, my
takeaway with the family that I

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:84%
met there in
Alabama is that they

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:84%
are as human as we are,
that they have emotions.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:90%
They care about their families.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:90%
They care about us.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.920 align:middle line:84%
They want to learn
more about us.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.870 align:middle line:84%
They go ahead and
I think they want

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:33.540 align:middle line:84%
to take away the good that's
within the human race.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And they hope, in the
process of doing this,

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.740 align:middle line:84%
they set an example
where we, the human race,

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:84%
take away the good
that's in their race,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.478 align:middle line:84%
without even understanding that
we come from separate places.

00:23:48.478 --> 00:23:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you
think their agenda is?

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
a lot of talk out

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.278 align:middle line:84%
there about this
negativity, that they're

00:23:53.278 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:90%
coming here to kill us.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:90%
What was your take on it?

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Used to be I'd go ahead
and just keep my mouth shut.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:90%
But I can't do that no more.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.680 align:middle line:84%
We were told from time to time
that not all contact would

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:84%
be of a friendly nature,
that the situation is

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:84%
that it's not a question
of being a friendly nature.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:84%
There are going to
be things that we

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.492 align:middle line:84%
are going to do that we
don't understand that may

00:24:16.492 --> 00:24:17.640 align:middle line:90%
be a threat to ourselves.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But as far as our visitors,
they mean us no harm.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:84%
We are more of a threat to
them than they are of us.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And the situation
is is that people

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.280 align:middle line:84%
need to look through
very human history

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:84%
to understand if they had
hostile intent against us

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to
take us over, it

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:84%
would be less than
a day that humanity

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:84%
as we know it would
cease to exist.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.260 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about a technology.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at the Germans.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.620 align:middle line:84%
They took over Poland
in less than a month

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:90%
because of their technology.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you
know, the technology

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:84%
that our visitors have,
using our own goals in NASA

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:09.770 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and come up with
new advanced propulsion systems.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:84%
They finally said in
about 2000 that we're not

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:84%
going to do this no more,
which we did still continue.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the technology
is 1,400 light year--

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:84%
1,400 years away
before we can even

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.360 align:middle line:84%
dream of using some
of this technology.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, our visitors are one to
two billion years ahead of us

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.390 align:middle line:90%
technologically.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:84%
In short, if they want to
destroy all of humanity--

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.010 align:middle line:90%
once again, less than a day--

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.720 align:middle line:90%
all of humanity could die.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:90%
They could be very selective.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Every other living thing
would still be alive,

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:84%
but just us bacteria
on this planet.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Because every bad
thing that happens on

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:90%
this planet is by us.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:55.995 align:middle line:90%
They could do away with us.

00:25:55.995 --> 00:25:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: With all
your experience

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:59.350 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials,
were there

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:84%
any discoveries that you
made, or your bosses made,

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.015 align:middle line:84%
that would connect us
through our lineage to them?

00:26:08.015 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: We need to
understand, there's

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.690 align:middle line:90%
nothing new under the sun.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And they always refer
to someday we're

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:84%
going to go ahead and join
the Galactic Brotherhood.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:84%
I call it the
Galactic Parliament.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it the
Galactic Federation.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And the whole situation
is, we're all interconnected.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.020 align:middle line:84%
There is that
relationship between us

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and the entities that
are within our universe

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.810 align:middle line:90%
and other universes.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:84%
There is that relationship that
is between us and, dare I say,

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:84%
multiverse, the other
existing dimensions

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:90%
that may be indefinite.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So the whole situation is it's
not only that we are not alone

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:07.660 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, we're related
to those entities that make up

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:11.635 align:middle line:84%
that universe in those
other dimensions.

00:27:11.635 --> 00:27:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So would
you say they're

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.770 align:middle line:90%
really compassionate about us?

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Oh, they're
very compassionate.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:17.890 align:middle line:84%
The whole situation
is, they know

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:21.070 align:middle line:84%
we may one day destroy
ourselves, if we don't fully

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:24.970 align:middle line:84%
understand that nuclear
radiation and things that we

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:29.780 align:middle line:84%
are doing to go ahead, discover
for the betterment of mankind.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.950 align:middle line:84%
We go ahead and we use it
or the detriment of mankind.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a
kid being in a room

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:90%
filled with gasoline fumes.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:90%
He's got a box of matches.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.710 align:middle line:84%
That kid needs to have an
understanding, that child needs

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.680 align:middle line:84%
to have an understanding,
don't strike a match,

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.440 align:middle line:84%
because if you do, you
and anybody else that's

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:84%
in that room is going
to cease to exist,

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.770 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to set
off the fumes in the air

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.075 align:middle line:90%
and kill everyone in there.

00:27:59.075 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, I'm glad that
they're around watching over

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.250 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Because we do need the help.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Sergeant
Clifford Stone.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.003 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Once again,
my great pleasure.

00:28:08.003 --> 00:28:09.670 align:middle line:84%
