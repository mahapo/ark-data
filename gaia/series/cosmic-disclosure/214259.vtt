>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:10%
we are joined by
Victoria Whitney,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:10%
a Doctor of Science and a
retired member of the United

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.330 align:middle line:10%
States Navy
Department of Defense.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:10%
She has worked as an
environmental engineer

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:10%
and scientist in special
programs and projects

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:10%
and is an expert in
extraterrestrial and crash site

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:10%
investigations.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll be discussing
the Omicron Commonwealth

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:90%
and the Andromedan shipbuilders.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.508 align:middle line:90%
Victoria, welcome to the show.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VICTORIA WHITNEY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they build
ships just for themselves,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.033 align:middle line:84%
or do they share it
with other races?

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: No, they share
it with other races.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.000 align:middle line:84%
They consider themselves
the elite shipbuilders

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So they do build
them for other races.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Do they build them
all as organic ships?

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
No, it depends on whatever
being is asking for that ship

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and what fits into their arsenal
or types of transportation,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.950 align:middle line:90%
whatever their needs are.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, they
said the Pleiadians have

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.020 align:middle line:84%
some sort of organic ship
that is in their supply,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:84%
but for the most part, they
use more of a metal alloy type

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:84%
thing, and I'm not
even sure what that is.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But they, as shipbuilders,
most of what they do

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.700 align:middle line:84%
is organic ships, but they do
build ships for other beings.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how far that goes.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
They have mentioned that
they do it for the Orions.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:84%
They've mentioned that
they do it for some Greys.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they said
that at some point

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:84%
they had built a ship
for a reptoid species

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.010 align:middle line:84%
but didn't go too
much into that,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:84%
said that it was a different
model than they had ever

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:90%
built before.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.800 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what that means.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why would they
build ships for races outside

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:90%
of the Galactic Federation?

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: They don't.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I think what's
happening is that these

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
are all members of the
Galactic Federation.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And so in that manner
of cooperation and being

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:90%
a community together--

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A show of confidence.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I mentioned, we
have a reptoid species.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.040 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that
all reptoids are bad--

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And so there are members that
belong to the Federation.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, if
they come and ask,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:84%
then the Andromedans are more
than willing to help them out

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
because after all, they all
have something at stake here.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very much now if
somebody else outside of that

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
came and asked, I think, they
would probably tell them no.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the volume at
which they are building ships

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.320 align:middle line:84%
would probably confine
that to the Federation

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
because I just don't think
they have enough time

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:90%
to do it outside of that.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:90%
So they invited me to the ship.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was parked
in a place called

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Gorst in Washington State,
which is a very protected area.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a watershed, so hardly
anybody goes up in there.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
When I first got there,
we're walking out.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge meadow.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Didn't see anything.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I thought, there's probably
some more walking left to do.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But as we got
there, then he hits

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.350 align:middle line:84%
one of the buttons
on his cuff and it

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:84%
came into seeing much larger
than what I was expecting,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:90%
very interesting shape to it.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So when I came up on
it, the closer you get,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
the more you see a
different reflection in it.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.973 align:middle line:84%
So I'm assuming that some type
of camouflaging that occurs--

00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What was the shape?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: It's sort
of a rounded shape.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:84%
On one side there's a piece
that comes out in the front.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:84%
There are these what
look like wings,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to say
wings like on a dragonfly,

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:90%
but they lay flat.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And what they were telling me
is that's a collector system.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at them,
they had hexagons on them.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually what
happened is when we got inside,

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:90%
they showed me.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So they come up and it looks
like a flower blooming.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And they collect
these particles that supply

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.290 align:middle line:90%
power to their system.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know how this
Andromedan ship was constructed?

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: I do know
how it was constructed.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:90%
So they use a framework system.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:90%
It's like a laser system.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
They have specific
models that they build.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.500 align:middle line:84%
They have space docking systems,
and this wire frame goes up.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.340 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, they
build organic ships.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And so they grow the ship
on this wire framework.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, that goes
away once the ship has grown.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It takes 10 days to grow a
ship to be fully functional.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Then it gets a flight suit--
the ship gets a flight suit.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So the one that I went
to visit with them

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.510 align:middle line:84%
has very much this osmium,
iridium, gallium flight suit.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
They explain that
it allows the ship

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
to split and then come back
together and still be a whole.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's some flexibility
and morphing that takes place

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:90%
with that flight suit.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:84%
The combination of the
osmium and the iridium

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:84%
is what gives it its
deflector shield, so to speak,

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
the protection aspect
of that for the ship.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The gallium is the
flexibility of their--

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.505 align:middle line:90%
they were showing being--

00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:33.172 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen that before where
you put the gallium in your hand

00:05:33.172 --> 00:05:34.510 align:middle line:90%
and it melts, right.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely, yeah.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.160 align:middle line:10%
>>WHITNEY: And the
ship is self-healing.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:84%
They showed me where it
had gotten a gash in it

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.270 align:middle line:84%
from a meteor collision,
and it healed itself.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you have a sense
of consciousness of this craft

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
when you were on board or
did you communicate with it?

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yes,
so it has a name.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
It made it very clear
that was its name,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and it very much could
be telepathic or verbal.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we went inside,
it was so much larger

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:84%
inside than what it looked
like on the outside.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And there were two seats
up towards the front of it.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like it's all
open, but it is an enclosure.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.720 align:middle line:84%
It just has that appearance--
like if you were looking

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:84%
at a fish tank or something,
with all the openness that--

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and the pilot and the
navigator sit there.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see any
display panel at first

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:90%
until they activated it.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And it is an AI technology that
a technology is inserted into it

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:90%
during the growth stage.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:90%
It has a circulatory system.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:90%
It has a respiratory system.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, very much like
a functioning being.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:90%
It thinks for itself.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:90%
It makes decisions for itself.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that
was interesting.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:90%
They do have a module.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
The Andromedans have a
module behind their ear

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that when they are bred, that
module is part of who they are.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And that gives them the
interface-- direct interface

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.360 align:middle line:84%
with the artificial
intelligence.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:84%
The navigator sat in his
chair and the next thing

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I know this big
holographic thing comes up

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:84%
around him that was
interacting either by thought

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:90%
or as he touched it.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:84%
That was my first
instance of how

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:84%
they found me is that they
showed me a map of the US

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and all of the frequencies
across that map.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.860 align:middle line:90%
And then he said, this is you.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And it showed me
standing on the ship.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's
really interesting.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:84%
I had never looked at
something like that.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And I did a lot of mapping
work with 3D systems.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So that was an
interesting thing to see.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.670 align:middle line:84%
They showed me that whatever
they want, the ship can produce.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:90%
So do you want to sit down?

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
there's a chair.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I asked about the med
bed because of Althan

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and getting a black eye before
and it suddenly was right there.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
They say if they need
sleeping quarters,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.310 align:middle line:90%
it produces sleeping quarters.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a very active ship
and highly intelligent.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
can ask it anything.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.160 align:middle line:90%
It can give you an answer.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:90%
It does think for itself.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I asked him about because he had
mentioned that they occasionally

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.115 align:middle line:90%
split into three ships.

00:08:26.115 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
there's only two of you.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a pilot and a navigator.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
to the third ship?

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural question.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
it thinks for itself.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, that's
interesting because how does

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.173 align:middle line:90%
it know what else is going on.

00:08:40.173 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And says, well, we're
connected with it.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So it knows what we're doing
and therefore, it can respond.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why would they do that?

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they
say a lot of times

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
they get in
situations where they

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
need to do more than
one type of thing,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:84%
like maybe they need to
send out something to probe

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And instead of sending
the entire ship,

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:84%
they just send
one section of it.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.425 align:middle line:90%
Or if they do encounter--

00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:10.070 align:middle line:84%
they told us they've encountered
some hostile environments before

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, having
three is better than one.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.070 align:middle line:90%
But they do come.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I asked him, can they
split more than three?

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:90%
And he said no.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Three-- for the model that they
were in, three was the max.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how
large was this one?

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: It was
pretty good size.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:31.410 align:middle line:84%
I would say if you put two
motorhomes back to back,

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.560 align:middle line:84%
one of the large ones,
that would probably

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:90%
be about the same length.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to give a frame
of reference in looking at it,

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
but it has a low-fusion system
on it for their power source.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:90%
They started it up.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.240 align:middle line:90%
I heard nothing.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I could feel a slight vibration,
but I couldn't hear anything.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, they
did raise the panel

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:84%
so that I could watch how
they collect particles.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful sight to watch.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a fascinating ship,
and they're very proud of them.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And this was one of
the smaller ones.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:84%
They did say that they do
have larger class ships.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I asked him if they had a
standard look to their ships.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.170 align:middle line:84%
In other words, is
it a saucer shape?

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Is it a triangle-- or what to
give us a frame of reference

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and they say, well,
we build them all.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But what they prefer
are more the disk

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.630 align:middle line:84%
shapes, because then they say
that they're more maneuverable.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:84%
That's what I took
away from that.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:90%
And it is a fascinating system.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:84%
They did show me where they were
growing one on a wire frame.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:84%
We look at things
that are growing here,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.390 align:middle line:90%
and it takes time, right?

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I heard
you saying 10 days.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: In 10 days and
the size of this thing,

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just so rapid.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how do they get the
consciousness infused into it?

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: So that's a--

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
they said that's
during day five.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:84%
There is some type of liquid
that is added to the system

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:90%
and that's the consciousness.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And then from that point on, it
builds the circulatory system,

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:18.978 align:middle line:84%
the respiratory system, and it's
all internal to the ship itself.

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
when I was inside,

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see any of that.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it looked
like you walked

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
into a room and our
effect of what we

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.620 align:middle line:90%
think a ship would look like.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
But it is very much
this organic ship.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And the ship I found
was personable,

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I was expecting when he told
me that it talked to you,

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:84%
I was expecting it to be
very robotic or our thought--

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I have an Alexa.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.070 align:middle line:84%
She's kind of a smart alec,
but I can talk to her.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
But it has to be
specific questions,

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.960 align:middle line:84%
otherwise she doesn't
answer it well.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:90%
But this is just different.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:90%
It's very personal.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:84%
It would just be like
you and I talking.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And it gave its opinion,
whether it was solicited or not.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was interesting.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.440 align:middle line:84%
It did have a
personality, and Zoran

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:84%
had said that because
they're bred for their ship,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
they know that ship intimately,
that it does interface with them

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:84%
in a way in which it's a
very personal relationship.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was interesting.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When I was
in the projects,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.890 align:middle line:84%
we were always taking samples
of not just the beans, but

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:84%
of the craft because
the DNA was matching.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle line:84%
How does-- with this craft
you're talking about,

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:84%
how does the sentient being, the
AI being, the conscious being

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and the pilots all connect
on what level and how?

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Sure.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, like I said,
they said to me

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that they were bred
for that ship, which

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.027 align:middle line:90%
means that they share DNA.

00:12:51.027 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.912 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: It would be just
like when we have a child.

00:12:54.912 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:90%
It's part of our DNA.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.510 align:middle line:84%
We have that natural
affection for them.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
We have a natural relationship
that we develop with them.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And that ship has that
with these two Andromedans

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and Kitanne had told me that
when the meteor had hit the ship

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and created a gash and he
said we all felt the pain.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, to be
that close to something,

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
to be able to feel
that type of pain.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.915 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we
compassion together.

00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that's
an interesting way

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:90%
to use that word.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:84%
But the ship, like
I say, it's an AI.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not even sure
how that happens.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't even
envision a liquid AI.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
that even looks like.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.710 align:middle line:84%
My mind could go and say, I
see the possibility for that.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But to have that into the ship
and for it to-- them to be bred

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:57.748 align:middle line:84%
in the same DNA for that ship
is such a huge concept and--

00:13:57.748 --> 00:13:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Highly advanced.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Definitely.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Some science
we don't know yet.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Indeed, I'm
excited for when we do.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So why a bioship rather
than a regular mechanical craft?

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, so if you talk
to them about their history,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.170 align:middle line:90%
they do relate--

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:84%
in their past, they were in
a lot of different wars--

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Lyran wars, Orion wars,
different things like that.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.510 align:middle line:90%
They had craft that was more--

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
different nature in which
different metallic alloys were

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
used, and they
found that they get

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:84%
damaged and then they got
to go back and be repaired.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And that took time out of
what they were trying to do.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.905 align:middle line:84%
And so they found that
the organic ships,

00:14:42.905 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:84%
because they can
heal themselves,

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.750 align:middle line:90%
are much more effective.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:84%
They also found that the
response time when you rely on--

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
while they're very
efficient at what they do.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
There's still a response
time between the ship

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:90%
and what they're trying to do.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that if you're
put into that type of situation,

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.960 align:middle line:84%
that response time is
all the difference.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So they begin to make a
transition to something

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
that they felt was
more effective.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And they do talk about the fact
that they do have some larger

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
ships that they cannot
make into bioships just

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.350 align:middle line:90%
because of the nature of them.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they said those are the
type of ships that they send

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:84%
to other planets,
and they wind up

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:84%
either being some security
force or something like that.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
So then bioships are contained
within them to release out.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit
different situation.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because
they're bioships,

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
are they more vulnerable to
attacks and weapons and disease

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:90%
even?

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, I guess
it would depend upon who

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.800 align:middle line:90%
they came in contact with.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
They have said several
times that sometimes they

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
come across a species that is
not willing to share territory,

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and so they will automatically
take the offensive against them.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And because the ship is so
responsive, most of the time

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.840 align:middle line:90%
it can avoid or evade harm.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:84%
They try not to
fire back on them

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:84%
because they realize that
they don't understand what

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:90%
they've come in contact with.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:84%
They did tell me that early
on when they were starting

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:84%
this system of bioships,
they did have problems

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:84%
with infections, certain
things that they would come

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:84%
in contact with, and
then the ship would

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:90%
have a bad response to it.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really know
what those things are.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:35.330 align:middle line:84%
But like I say, I was able
to see where it was still

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:84%
healing from the
meteorite strike,

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and it looks very
much just like us.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:90%
There's a scarring over system.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they said
eventually the flight suit

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:90%
will smooth all of that out.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:84%
But I told them, I said, so is
that scar long lasting, though?

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, it's
just a temporary situation.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I asked the question about
weapons and they said,

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:90%
we have very advanced weapons.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.320 align:middle line:90%
We always win.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
so what is that?

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we're
not going to tell you that.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:12.255 align:middle line:84%
But they do carry
a rod on their hip.

00:17:12.255 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What it look like?

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So it's
about this long.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:90%
It's about this big around.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:10%
>>WHITNEY: And it's some type
of pulse and at one point,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.380 align:middle line:10%
Kitanne went out and he
went to the tree, which

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:10%
I found interesting.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.500 align:middle line:10%
He went to the tree and he put
his arms around it and he said,

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:10%
I have much love
and respect for you.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And then he backed
away and shot the tree.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:34.807 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:17:34.807 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Which I--

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A demonstration.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: A demonstration--

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.207 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm assuming.

00:17:38.207 --> 00:17:40.082 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: But I thought
that was interesting

00:17:40.082 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:90%
that he did that first.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw come out was
this sort of bluish light.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a donut, but you
could tell that it was a wave.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And when it hit
that tree, it just

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.710 align:middle line:90%
disintegrated the entire tree.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.723 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So then
he came back and he

00:17:58.723 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:90%
told me these are not toys.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:90%
And I said I could see that.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you describe
the navigation technologies

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle line:90%
inside the craft?

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Sure.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So a holograph comes up
around the navigator.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:84%
He sits in there, it
goes entirely around him

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and his chair is able to
swivel around inside that.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.960 align:middle line:90%
It's sectioned off.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
He does have one section that
is all environment, which is

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:90%
what's contained in the ship.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:84%
There's another section
that allows him to navigate,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:84%
whether they're interstellar
or whether they're on planet.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
switching system that

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:84%
takes place in there
that allows you

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:90%
to see different star charts.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
My question, because we do a lot
of tracking of ships in the sky.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so how
does that work?

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, it's
highly sophisticated.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And he brings up a star
chart, and he shows me where

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:90%
the space dock is located at.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, if we
were leaving the space dock,

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.080 align:middle line:84%
he said, we pick a point and
they go through a jump gate.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And explained how
a jump gate worked.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:90%
And it uses hexagons, and--

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does it form
the jump gate, the craft?

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: The-- it
forms the jump gate.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: A distortion
system goes around the ship.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiral distortion
system and that

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.192 align:middle line:84%
opens up the space so that
they could travel through that.

00:19:24.192 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And when they're done, when
they reach the other end,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:90%
then it closes behind them.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:90%
So fascinating system.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Nice.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.078 align:middle line:84%
But they use a jump
and that's what

00:19:33.078 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:84%
he says is they jump
from point to point.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't just
travel through space.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Nonlinear.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
fascinating to see--

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:84%
because they track
all of their trips.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And so he brought up
one so that I could

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:90%
see where they had taken one.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.340 align:middle line:84%
They were going from
the Pleiades system

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.880 align:middle line:90%
to the Orion system.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
quick jump that way.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:84%
They did say that Orion system
has a trading center there,

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:84%
where lots of different
species come in there to trade

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:90%
their wares and what have you.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they spend a lot of
time going there and getting

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.880 align:middle line:90%
supplies and things like that.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.530 align:middle line:84%
They have one as
well on the Pleiades,

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.570 align:middle line:84%
but I guess not as large as
the one on the Orion system.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And they say lots of different
beings come in there.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:84%
They said, if you want
to go someplace and see

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:84%
the culmination of the universe,
that's the place to go.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: So very interesting.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:84%
If they need to get
parts for the ship,

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
they don't go someplace like
a trading system to get it.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.770 align:middle line:84%
They take it back
to the space dock

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:90%
and it's all done organically.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.733 align:middle line:84%
So it would be just like if we
had surgery done or something--

00:20:41.733 --> 00:20:42.533 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And they just
go and have that added.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I did ask him
is we trade models here fairly

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.920 align:middle line:84%
frequently, whether it's cars or
whether it's jets or whatever.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.173 align:middle line:84%
We always want the next
generation of that.

00:20:56.173 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked
him, I said, how do

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.570 align:middle line:84%
you figure the next generation
for your different classes?

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
it's really quite easy.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.040 align:middle line:84%
If we can make a wire
frame out of it, then--

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Growing.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.091 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:21:08.091 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
fascinating because a system

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:84%
where you're using just lasers,
so to speak, to make a wire

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:90%
frame, the sky's the limit.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
build this class of ship

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:90%
that they're using.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the one that they prefer
right now because it's small.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.470 align:middle line:84%
It can go both interstellar
and interplanetary.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, not all of
the ships can do that.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So this one allows them
to do multiple things.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:84%
They did show me
this, a mother ship,

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.980 align:middle line:90%
what we call a mother ship.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't call
it a mother ship,

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.250 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better word, where
they were saying that it's not

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:84%
uncommon for them to be able to
hold 30 to 40 different classes

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.050 align:middle line:90%
of ship on them.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:90%
And they're very large.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%
They say that people have
this thought that they're just

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:90%
floating around the cosmos.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, that
they only use them

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.530 align:middle line:84%
when they need to
use them, but they

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
have full forces
that live on them

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.700 align:middle line:90%
and they're bred for that ship.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, pretty
interesting stuff, right?

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So, like I say, I didn't
get to see a real one.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No--

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: But just being able
to hear about those things

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:90%
is fascinating.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did the Andromedans
have anything to do

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:90%
with our moon and its placement?

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: They say that they
are the builders of the moon,

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and they say that they have a
history of when that occurred.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:84%
There was mention of this
used to be a very unruly place

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.930 align:middle line:90%
before the moon came.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And they say that unfortunately
our moon is breaking down.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:90%
It needs maintenance.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.610 align:middle line:84%
They say that they
brought it here

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:84%
to provide a better
environment for the Earth,

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:84%
that they were part
of that system.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I asked them, if you're
maintaining it, right,

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing to fix it.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we don't
own that contract anymore.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what that
means, because I did ask them

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:90%
who owns the contract.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And they said, that's not
in our knowledge base.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have anything
to do with terraforming,

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And it is just providing
a means with which

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:84%
to control the climate
and different tidal forces

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:17.922 align:middle line:90%
and things like that on it.

00:23:17.922 --> 00:23:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you tell us
their involvement with Mars?

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.713 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: According
to their history,

00:23:21.713 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Mars used to look just
a lot like this planet,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:84%
but that terrible things
have happened to it.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:84%
There used to be full
colonies on there.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people that
are in the Federation,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:39.450 align:middle line:84%
different factions had
bases or facilities on there

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:44.700 align:middle line:84%
with which to live out of
and that we weren't the only

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
blue marble in the
sky at that time,

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.260 align:middle line:90%
but something terrible happened.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And they believed that it has
a lot to do with the Anunnaki.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:84%
They believe that
planet was destroyed

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and that there was some force
from the remains of that

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:05.920 align:middle line:84%
collided with Mars and
started a chain reaction.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And so nobody has
really taken steps

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.865 align:middle line:84%
to come back and do
anything with that planet.

00:24:13.865 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did they tell
you about the Anunnaki?

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Lots.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.413 align:middle line:84%
They said they believe
that they own the universe.

00:24:20.413 --> 00:24:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, they do.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And well, they don't
call them malevolent.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:90%
They do call them territorial.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was an
interesting word to use.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And they explained that they
go throughout the universe,

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.770 align:middle line:84%
take the resources
that they want,

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:43.290 align:middle line:84%
don't have any real respect
for the species that

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.580 align:middle line:90%
is living there.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.512 align:middle line:84%
And so you get a sense of
the bully of the universe.

00:24:48.512 --> 00:24:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I've heard the same.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, they do say
that a lot of what we consider

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:84%
to be gods has to do
with the Anunnaki,

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.670 align:middle line:84%
that they presented
themselves that way.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And if we're willing
to follow that,

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:84%
then they were more than
happy to maintain that title.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:04.627 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: So--

00:25:04.627 --> 00:25:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Book of
Enoch and everything.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So it is interesting that
they do have history with that

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.540 align:middle line:90%
and can relate to it.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
We have a history where
we say that-- they

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
say they're going to come
back and they said probably

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.392 align:middle line:90%
they show up sooner or later.

00:25:20.392 --> 00:25:22.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't really keep
that track of them

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:84%
anymore because it's such
a wide spectrum of regions

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.260 align:middle line:90%
that they travel about.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So they haven't really
run into them lately.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what is the
Omicron Commonwealth?

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, it's a vision
that was presented to me in 2009

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:90%
by Pleiadians.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.700 align:middle line:84%
They have come to us and
told us that as a planet,

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.660 align:middle line:84%
we need to unite and we can't
do it under any one government.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So they asked us to create
this Omicron Commonwealth,

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and our purpose is
to bring humanity

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.930 align:middle line:84%
together so that we can get into
the greater cosmos communities.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, they took
me to the cosmos.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.750 align:middle line:90%
They're taking me in the future.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:90%
So this has not happened yet.

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how far into
the future for the audience?

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So the
time that I saw

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.880 align:middle line:84%
displayed on one of
the monitors was 2030.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
So we're not too far
off from that, which

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.000 align:middle line:90%
means I need to get to work.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.885 align:middle line:84%
But it was a biosphere
that they took me to.

00:26:19.885 --> 00:26:21.260 align:middle line:84%
When I first saw
it, I thought it

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.860 align:middle line:84%
was a planet because it was so
large, but it was a biosphere.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:84%
They say that it was
created by the Andromedans.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.700 align:middle line:84%
There was so many
people on board.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked him, I
said, how many people?

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there are
a billion people that

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.620 align:middle line:90%
live within this biosphere.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it like cities
inside there or is it

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.430 align:middle line:90%
land like mountains and rivers?

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: So it was layers.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.440 align:middle line:10%
>>WHITNEY: Can you
envision living

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:10%
on the inside of planet Earth?

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's basically
these layers go across.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:84%
I saw homes in
there, businesses.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like entire
cities contained within this.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And there was a center deck that
was their main operating area.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was in uniform.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, what's
the size of this sphere?

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it like?

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So when I asked them,
they said it's larger than Earth

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:90%
and smaller than Saturn.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.793 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, huge.

00:27:22.793 --> 00:27:23.710 align:middle line:90%
That's what I thought.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:90%
It was a planet at first.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But like I say, there
were a billion people

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.440 align:middle line:90%
that were living inside it.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:34.360 align:middle line:84%
There were very much
uniformed people,

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:41.025 align:middle line:84%
and then there were people
dressed in more modern clothing.

00:27:41.025 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't even have a
frame of reference

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.930 align:middle line:84%
for that sort of
jumpsuit type things.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Everybody seemed to be happy.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:84%
They have a school system
unlike anything we had seen.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.190 align:middle line:84%
They go in and they sit
down in one of the chairs

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.520 align:middle line:84%
that I talked about earlier
that cocoons around you

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.600 align:middle line:90%
and they get a download.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And so if you go
in there and say,

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:84%
today, I think I'll
be an engineer,

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.780 align:middle line:84%
they just give you a
download to be an engineer.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
times have changed.

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.410 align:middle line:84%
But it was a fascinating
place to look at.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And its purpose
is to stop things

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:84%
that are detrimental to
the rest of the universe.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And they came and told
me that this would

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:90%
be the instance in which--

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.150 align:middle line:84%
there's a thing that they refer
to as the great evil that's

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.550 align:middle line:84%
coming, and that's the
alliance between the serpents

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:90%
and the Draconians.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And that in order
for the universe

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:84%
to be in a better place,
that has to be dealt with.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the
purpose of this biosphere,

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:43.480 align:middle line:90%
is to deal with that.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go into what we
resolved with that at this time,

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.700 align:middle line:84%
but I think that this is
a well thought-out plan.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So I got a lot of time to
go through different areas.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised when
I saw farms on there.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised when I saw
hydroponic gardens, like--

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.350 align:middle line:84%
I've seen hydroponic gardens,
but nothing like this.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:90%
So well contained system.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Everybody seemed to
be happy and healthy

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and everybody seemed to be
working in a unified manner.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
animals and fish

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and other living creatures
besides humans and other races?

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, well, one
deck had an aquarium on it,

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know whether they
were raising fish as food.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think so, because they
did show me food replicators.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
that's the case.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.610 align:middle line:84%
But they did have fish
of all shapes and sizes.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Some I couldn't recognize.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.320 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, they're
not from here.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Several people had pets
that they maintained.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.110 align:middle line:90%
So I did see a dog.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.240 align:middle line:90%
I saw several cats.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we saw cows when
we saw the farm, I saw sheep.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:84%
It was an interesting
concept because I would not

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.700 align:middle line:90%
have thought of going there.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
it was trying to do

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.750 align:middle line:84%
is create a normal
environment that a lot of them

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.870 align:middle line:84%
were used to having, and I
think it's trying to make it

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:84%
so that it wasn't outside
of being the norm.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How far did you
go around this biosphere?

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, multiple levels,
more surface area than Earth.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So I was
there for several hours,

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.040 align:middle line:84%
although I didn't realize that
it wasn't until I got back

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.080 align:middle line:84%
that I realized I had been
there for several hours.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.230 align:middle line:84%
I got a sampling
of different decks.

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So it would be like you
say, I'm going to go out

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.070 align:middle line:90%
for an hour-long drive, right.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically
what happened

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:84%
in that short little hour-long
drive, I saw a lot of things

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:90%
and I still never reached.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I may have gone 70 miles, but
if something has 30,000 miles

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.400 align:middle line:84%
across, you're going to
see very little of it.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So like I say, I got
a sampling of them,

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:07.600 align:middle line:84%
but there's no way you
could cover all of it.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What impressed you
the most out of everything

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:90%
that you saw was taught?

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Gosh.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
impressive thing

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:19.592 align:middle line:84%
is that this is their way of
showing that they care about us.

00:31:19.592 --> 00:31:22.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a way of
them showing that we

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:24.520 align:middle line:84%
can take care of
ourselves as well

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and become part of
that greater community.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.200 align:middle line:90%
They can't intervene.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have laws that
don't allow them to intervene,

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:84%
but they're trying to show us
that we're going to give you

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:90%
a vision of what you can do.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.635 align:middle line:84%
Somebody just has to take
the initiative to do it.

00:31:40.635 --> 00:31:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
they're trying to show

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.160 align:middle line:84%
us is that we're far more
capable of coming together

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.550 align:middle line:84%
than we are of creating more
division amongst ourselves.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just a cycle that
we're going through.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I think looking
at it that way,

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.993 align:middle line:90%
there's great hope for us.

00:31:57.993 --> 00:32:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what are you going
to do with that experience?

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: What
am I going to do?

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm trying to build
Omicron Commonwealth.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: We get a lot
of people that look at us.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.460 align:middle line:84%
We do look like an
anomaly, and they come up

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and usually they refer
to us as Space Force.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So we say, well, no,
we're not Space Force.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:84%
We do tell them we're
Omicron Commonwealth.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.500 align:middle line:84%
We're here to unite
humanity together

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and to create the world of
which we're meant to live in.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's
here on planet Earth

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.070 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's out
in the greater cosmos,

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.840 align:middle line:84%
we are part of that, and we
need to start realizing what

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.330 align:middle line:84%
a great part we have
to play in that.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I agree.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.650 align:middle line:90%
It's going to go that way.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:35.695 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: I think it is.

00:32:35.695 --> 00:32:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's
no other choice.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Sooner than--
sooner rather than later to.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.093 align:middle line:84%
So we need to start
thinking in that direction.

00:32:43.093 --> 00:32:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, as a
wealth of knowledge,

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Victoria, I want to say thank
you for being on the show.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, I am glad that
I was here to share with you.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm Emery Smith and this
is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
