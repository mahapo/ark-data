00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:15.425 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.200 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.730 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David
Wilcock, and we

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.610 align:middle line:10%
have a special surprise
for you; the insider

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.912 align:middle line:10%
who I referred to as Paul.

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And I can reveal
for the first time

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:90%
that his name is Emery Smith.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And you may know him if you
ever saw the movie, "Sirius."

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.415 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:32.706 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Oh, thanks Dave.

00:00:32.706 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited to be here.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.910 align:middle line:84%
10 years in the making
of working with you

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and establishing a
great relationship.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you're the reason
that a lot of my progression

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.640 align:middle line:84%
in this field of
undisclosed information

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.930 align:middle line:90%
has been brought to me.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, it's time now

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:84%
to bring it forward, which,
thanks for helping me

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:90%
get to that point.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Because as you know, for the
past three to five years,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of just
holding onto it.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, in
the movie "Sirius,"

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:84%
there is an autopsy of a little,
six-inch tall, apparently

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:90%
extra-terrestrial body.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Who, in the movie,
is doing that autopsy?

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was vice president
for CSeTi for about five years,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and what had happened
was there was

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:84%
this being, of course,
that was taken over

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:90%
by a civilian lab in Spain.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And the government actually
did have it before anyone else,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:90%
but no one knows about that.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So the thing was, the people
I was working with in CSeTi

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:84%
decided it would be a great
idea to go over here, and let's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:84%
do an autopsy, and
let's get some DNA.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Because if you get some DNA,
well, that outrules everything.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And let's get a major
university to do it.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So being through my background,
working with tissue from

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:90%
un-Earth origin--

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.150 align:middle line:84%
in these compartmentalized
programs,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I've seen over 3,000
of these things--

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
that it was just a winner
for me to be the person to go

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.110 align:middle line:84%
do the autopsy on
the senior team.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was definitely
also assisted

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Steven Greer
and Dr. Jan Bravo.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So they were, of
course, the physicians

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%
there witnessing this and
helping me harvest this tissue.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I don't think
anybody will forgive me if we

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:84%
don't talk, at least
in the first episode--

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:90%
we'll get started--

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
about how you came to
have multiple medical

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.260 align:middle line:84%
doctorate-level knowledge from
classified military programs.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, I--

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So can we talk about
what you did in the military

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.380 align:middle line:90%
with this unusual biology?

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, sure.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, it all
started, actually,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
when I joined the
military at an early age.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.440 align:middle line:90%
I was what they call a 90252.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they still
use those codes anymore.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.140 align:middle line:84%
But it had to do with being
like a surgical technician.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Just a person who hands
instruments to the physician.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was also a paramedic
and a surgical first assist,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and then I became a teacher for
that very quickly, overnight.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And then when I moved to
Kirtland Air Force Base,

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
they offered me a special,
what we call moonlighting job,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.300 align:middle line:90%
they call it.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was still a
kid, you understand.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I was very young, but I was
very intelligent and very mature

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:90%
for my age at that time.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was fascinated
when they were putting me

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
in charge of million
dollar equipment

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.270 align:middle line:84%
that not normal people would
be able to even utilize

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
or even-- it's not
even ready for-- even

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:90%
to be used for civilians yet.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So that lured me
into working this OK,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:84%
well we're going to say
you're this, Sergeant Smith,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.620 align:middle line:84%
but you're really
going to be doing this.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.590 align:middle line:84%
But you're still going
to be getting paid.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.090 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I'm working for
civilian, compartmentalized

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:84%
programs, but I'm an
active duty service member.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:90%
And it worked out.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.362 align:middle line:90%
I know there was a lot of--

00:04:16.362 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
I could tell that
the people that I

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.579 align:middle line:84%
was working for in the
operating rooms there,

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
it was like, well, why
is Smith always leaving

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.835 align:middle line:90%
every day at noon?

00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Where does he go?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he has a knee issue.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
He has to go to
physical therapy.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.960 align:middle line:84%
So down the chain
of command, they

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:84%
knew something was
going on, but they also

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:84%
had to keep it
justifiable, in a way,

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.860 align:middle line:84%
until let's get him out of
here, and let's go full-time

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:84%
with this, basically, dissecting
tissues of unknown origin.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I got sucked
in and was just getting

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.219 align:middle line:90%
obsessed with what I was doing.

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: And you said this
was Kirtland Air Force Base?

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.860 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yes, this was Kirtland
Air Force Base, where I--

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.490 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: And where is that?

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: This is
where I started,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:10%
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I was not just working
there, I was moonlighting

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
doing this other
stuff after hours,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and that had to do with
Sandia and Los Alamos labs.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sandia.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, Sandia Labs
is another secured location

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:90%
on Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like a base
within a base that goes

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:90%
underground many, many stories.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let's start to
break into this a little bit.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to
you about this--

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten bits and pieces
of this from you over a decade

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And as time has gone on,
you've been able to share more.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.720 align:middle line:84%
You've been authorized
to tell me more.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's just put this
on the record right now.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you confirm that you have
been authorized to disclose

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.790 align:middle line:90%
what we're talking about now?

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
That this is officially
OK at this time?

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: My NDA has
expired, but I am still--

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
talk about something

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:84%
that I don't feel
comfortable talking about

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:84%
if I don't believe it's
something that would put you

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:90%
or me in harm until that comes.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying now, I
believe, is going to be fine.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I've not been threatened
ever for any of that.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:84%
The only time I
was ever threatened

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
is when I brought the DNA back
from the Atacama from Spain,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:90%
illegally, from Barcelona.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought when
the government--

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
when I was getting threatened,
and they tried three

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:90%
assassination attempts on me--

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I remember.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It was very horrifying.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.624 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was because
that I took the DNA from,

00:06:36.624 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, over there, brought it
here, and snuck it to Stanford.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.632 align:middle line:90%
And it had nothing to do that.

00:06:43.632 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:84%
It had to do with someone
getting upset with me

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
because I resigned
and then putting

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.040 align:middle line:84%
three compartmentalized
labs that,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
during my work with
this group, had

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.855 align:middle line:84%
their own team,
their own wet teams,

00:06:58.855 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:84%
we call them, to come and
do the little dirty work.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to
get out of that,

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:84%
thank goodness, to help from,
actually, the US government.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And some military and CIA
officials, Army and CIA

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:84%
officials, really helped
out and turned around

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and threatened back,
and it was not only me,

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:84%
but it was also another
colleague of mine

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:90%
that were working on that--

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:90%
at a being.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- immediately,
everything stopped.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought they
just told me when

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I was taken to the
wet room because I

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
was escaping where I
was in Florida, getting

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:90%
all these threats.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.740 align:middle line:84%
They just flew me right
there, next thing you know.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, what
do I do, why I'm here.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:51.590 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.881 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, just so people--
in case they don't know,

00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
the wet room has got tile on
the walls, the floor, a drain

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
floor, and the wet

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:90%
is your blood, basically.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
It's and equipped--
this is where

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.380 align:middle line:84%
they take people and kill them,
and it's an easy clean up.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
You've got a nice, big
drain, a bunch of hoses.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.305 align:middle line:90%
And a huge disinfectant system.

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you knew what this
was when they took you into it.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you were
very intimidated.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've seen different
types of wet rooms,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.710 align:middle line:84%
not for humans, but
for other things

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and other
compartmentalized projects.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.420 align:middle line:90%
But never in Washington, DC.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So they just said, you
violated your contract.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, before
you kill me, could you

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.520 align:middle line:84%
please show me and tell me
where I violated my contract,

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:90%
and I'll be happy with that.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know
everything about me.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.530 align:middle line:84%
You have your own
satellite on me.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
You know every phone, text
message, you know everything.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything is bugged.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what did I do?

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.560 align:middle line:90%
You know, just tell me.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And eight hours later, I
was sweating in this room,

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:84%
they came back, they said,
we're very sorry, Mr. Smith.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.749 align:middle line:84%
It was an internal
problem, and you will never

00:08:59.749 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:90%
have to worry about that again.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:90%
We apologize.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.724 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really
beautiful moment.

00:09:04.724 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the first
time that I felt

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:84%
like the alliance of people in
there were trying to protect me

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:84%
or trying to do
something positive,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
besides expose me or hurt
my family or you know.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.804 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: You go to Sandia, and--

00:09:18.804 --> 00:09:19.604 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:09:19.604 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm already living
there on the base.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I already have my own
place on the base.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And I work at a
hospital off the base,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.180 align:middle line:84%
the VA Kirtland Air Force Base
Hospital is actually off-base,

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:90%
which is odd.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget,
Kirtland Air Force Base

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.694 align:middle line:84%
is the fifth largest
base in the world,

00:09:37.694 --> 00:09:39.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
they used to hide

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle line:90%
the nukes in the mountains.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I've shown my
handlers and people just flying

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:90%
over there to see the doors.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Those giant doors.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.356 align:middle line:84%
But they're not used for
that anymore, they're

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:90%
used for other things.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, we have
New Mexico and Nevada

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:90%
near each other.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.299 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we have
area 51 in Nevada.

00:09:57.299 --> 00:09:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They're all connected.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So have you ever
ridden the sub shuttle system?

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Only from
Sandia to Los Alamos,

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and I might have went
to Dulce and back,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
where it stopped.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
to do something.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.284 align:middle line:90%
There's four of them, and--

00:10:15.284 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Four of what?

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: These mag
lev-type trains.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:84%
But from what I
just recently heard,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:84%
they're all upgraded, updated,
and completely different.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.440 align:middle line:84%
More like a vacuum-tube
magnetic thing.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's some other
stuff I worked with.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Just because of the
tissue regeneration stuff

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I was involved with,
a lot of the craft,

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:84%
that I was brought
into different projects

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.590 align:middle line:84%
to look at the craft, because
the craft are actually alive.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.691 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The craft were alive.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.772 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The craft were alive,
and they were conscious.

00:10:52.772 --> 00:10:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This is
similar to what we

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.130 align:middle line:84%
heard from David Adair, where
he described going to Area 51

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and seeing this power
system that was actually

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:90%
a living being.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But it was this very large
thing that had like--

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.120 align:middle line:84%
it looked like a skeleton
over the surface of it.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It had tissue components, but it
also had technology components.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.414 align:middle line:84%
It was some weird
blend of technology--

00:11:13.414 --> 00:11:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:90%
It's right.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
It also-- and that's
already started.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was part of that movement
too, where we formulated tissue

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:90%
into titanium.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.200 align:middle line:90%
It's called osseo-integration.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's a good one to
get into at some point

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:84%
because that's what led us
in the underground projects

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
to say, man, if we can have
tissue and titanium to be

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:41.100 align:middle line:84%
together, and I can make your
bone tissue and titanium,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
pretty strong, Dave.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be hard for
me to break that bond.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And then add stem cells to that
and platelet-rich plasma, which

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.090 align:middle line:84%
increases bone density up
to, sometimes, 10 times.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Your own bone.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.740 align:middle line:90%
Keep that in mind.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So that sounds
a lot like Wolverine

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:90%
in the X-men movies.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, osseo-integration,
where they just

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:84%
basically you know made him all
these steel protective plates,

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.874 align:middle line:84%
but he also had a super
ability to heal very quickly.

00:12:12.874 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's the secret.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.206 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
all want to know.

00:12:15.206 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:90%
How do we have no downtime?

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And now not do we not
have any downtime,

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and not just for the super
soldier programs I was part of.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the soldier programs

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.500 align:middle line:90%
that you don't hear about.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:35.510 align:middle line:84%
The more upper-level
cabal, majestic-type secret

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle line:84%
corporation levels, where
they're trying to anti-age you.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And now that this new protein
has just been discovered,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:84%
A2M, Alpha 2 Macro
Globulin, holy moly.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
They just-- they just
turned back time.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And now that that's out,
I can tell you right now,

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:84%
probably in 5 to 10
years-- it will probably

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:90%
take 10 years for the FDA.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
What this does is it's a
protease inhibitor, which means

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.800 align:middle line:90%
it blocks all inflammation.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:90%
So the body can heal itself.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:84%
See, everything you have that
you need to survive forever

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.180 align:middle line:84%
or for a very long time
is already in your body.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:84%
The problem is these fields
around us and these--

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.050 align:middle line:84%
the foods we eat,
everything is poisoned.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So it makes us
have inflammation.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care if
you're in a car accident,

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:84%
or if you have a disease, it
all starts with inflammation.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I can stop
inflammation, your body

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:90%
will heal itself naturally.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's very exciting.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Very exciting.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that A2M,
I did not discover that.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.327 align:middle line:84%
I was just part of a project
that specialized in that,

00:13:51.327 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:90%
and that's how I learned it all.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.130 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm so excited now.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.040 align:middle line:84%
It's here for the civilians,
and it's all over.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
how you got started

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrial biology.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Were you aware at first that
you were autopsying ETs?

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.698 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No

00:14:08.698 --> 00:14:09.947 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: How did they do that?

00:14:09.947 --> 00:14:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They-- [LAUGHS]
and it was really funny too,

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:84%
because the entrance to where
I was going was Sandia Labs,

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.420 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't in their compound.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:90%
It was another little building.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.019 align:middle line:90%
But it goes down 30 some floors.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And when I got down
there, and they took me

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:84%
down these hallways, and they
were just-- on my first day,

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I just remember, I was
in this little room, kind

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:84%
of like you would see in
movies where the room's kind

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:84%
of all white, with the little
table, steel table, and all

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:90%
these instruments there.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And you're escorted
to this place.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And you get in there, and
there's this piece of tissue.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's all positive
pressure air system.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I go in there--
and you do scrub out,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.810 align:middle line:84%
just like a surgeon
scrubs and put his gowns

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:90%
on, and the hoods and stuff.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.810 align:middle line:90%
You do go in there, do all that.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And you label like
you would like when

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.030 align:middle line:90%
we're in a biology school frog.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:90%
You're like, OK.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:90%
This is a muscle.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:90%
This is a tongue, or whatever.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was just there to
label and take small samples

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and put them in these different
types of jars and vats

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and containers,
which I would then

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.790 align:middle line:84%
push through a drawer in a wall,
and someone else would take it,

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.030 align:middle line:90%
and that was it.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.289 align:middle line:84%
So I was basically
taking tissue samples

00:15:30.289 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:84%
from whatever piece
of tissue it was.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Some looked like salmon.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Some looked like
I don't even know.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:90%
I can't even explain it.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.710 align:middle line:84%
But then every
three to six months,

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.140 align:middle line:84%
you get a upper
security clearance.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:90%
So I stayed with that.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you described
to me before that you

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:90%
called them salmon filets.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.596 align:middle line:84%
When you first got started,
would it be like a square,

00:15:52.596 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:90%
like this big or something?

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it was like
a perfectly cut square,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.640 align:middle line:84%
with arteries,
veins, nerves, just

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:90%
different types of tissues.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Different types of--
cellular tissues, I mean.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you would find
cartilage in a weird area.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you would
see neural matter.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.160 align:middle line:90%
But it was always different.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the samples
started getting

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:84%
more intact, where you
could tell that, whoa,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:90%
this is a hand.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And I could not tell you
what that is at that point.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even say--

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And you're not allowed
to ask anything.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:84%
You just do that, and you
don't talk to anybody,

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and that's your
job, and that's it.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What if you told
your friends or your family?

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Were you given security
briefings about that?

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.150 align:middle line:90%
That I would be killed.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Now you say a hand.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.238 align:middle line:84%
I mean, describe what
the hand might look like.

00:16:55.238 --> 00:16:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Give me one example of the hand.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, imagine every
creature on this planet that

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:10.980 align:middle line:84%
has a hand, and evolution
then, a billion years from now,

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.270 align:middle line:90%
to have the five star--

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Like the human star.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Human star.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.921 align:middle line:84%
And so you might have
a very small hand,

00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:20.170 align:middle line:90%
and it might look like a frog.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.289 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a
little bit different.

00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:90%
But it's a palm.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:90%
Like, it's got prints.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:29.890 align:middle line:90%
It's got nails.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It could be something
like a raccoon.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking
everything's different now.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:84%
The most fascinating ones
were the giant insect.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:90%
These hands were just enormous.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And they were not
only living tissue,

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:90%
they were plant tissue as well.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So they had some sort of thing
they were making or growing

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:84%
that involved plant tissue
with some other sort

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:84%
of living tissue, which they
would mix many different types

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:90%
of hybrid tissues together.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:90%
It's old school.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows that
in these projects.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- you've probably
heard about it out there.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:84%
They've mixed every type
of animal tissue, DNA,

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.417 align:middle line:90%
with human to see what happens.

00:18:18.417 --> 00:18:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Like Dulce, New Mexico.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:90%
All that kind of crazy stuff.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they started adding
and adding and adding.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And then when they started
getting things from up there,

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:90%
that's when it got weird.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So whether or not this
was an extraterrestrial,

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't say at
that time, because I

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.150 align:middle line:84%
know they could have grew
whatever this was and killed

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:84%
it, chopped it up in
little, bitty pieces,

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.140 align:middle line:90%
sent it to all these places.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.281 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't the only
technician doing this.

00:18:49.281 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of the
things that I'd really

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:84%
like to drill into a lot
more is if you can give us

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
a much more exacting
description of the facility

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.490 align:middle line:90%
that you worked in.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about even
something as simple

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:84%
as is there a parking lot, or do
you have an underground parking

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:90%
garage?

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, exactly.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.154 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like you hear the
stories about people flying out

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:84%
to Nevada or whatever,
go to Area 51.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:90%
It's like one way in and out.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, with this, these places,
there's multiple places

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.370 align:middle line:84%
in and out, depending on where
you're going to be working

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.240 align:middle line:90%
and what section.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're very large
underground facilities.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're-- we're talking
up to 100 acres of multilevel

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:84%
facilities down there, with many
special wings that do certain

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:38.430 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Some works on energy propulsion,
some works on regeneration.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Some works-- there's a whole
medical thing to it too,

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and there's actually
a small little city

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:84%
of people that
actually live there

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:84%
that do not come to the surface,
usually, that I'm aware of.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very dynamic setup.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So for me, since I was
already living on the base,

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
it was easy, because
I just rode my bicycle

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.920 align:middle line:90%
to this small building.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So the small building,
which you would just

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.230 align:middle line:84%
think would be a fire
tower or whatever,

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:84%
is actually just in the
middle of a big area.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- you could park
1,000 cars there if you want.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.210 align:middle line:84%
No one would even
think anything.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So you go in, and you
take an elevator down,

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:90%
and you get on a big hallway.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:90%
It's an escalator.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And the escalator, just like
you would see at an airport,

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and then the
escalator's really long.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.020 align:middle line:84%
You're on the escalator
for about 10 minutes.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So you're actually
going somewhere else--

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And it's moving fast?

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, it's very fast.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:90%
You can actually sit down on it.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What are you seeing?

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Is it a tunnel?

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Just a tunnel.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a hallway.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It's white, and it has
a black marble ceiling.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Like black onyx.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it is, if it's--

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:84%
they can see through it,
but it's a very different--

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
back then, that was very
different to see, of course.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And the tunnel is not big.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think that one
of these underground drilling

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:84%
machines could have made
that tunnel, possibly?

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.350 align:middle line:90%
The heat one did.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.794 align:middle line:84%
The one that melts
rock into a molten--

00:21:10.794 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:84%
that's how they
made all the lava.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:84%
They basically make
lava tubes now.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they're
still doing all over.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Making an underground
freeway to go anywhere

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:90%
you want in the world.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, when we think
of an escalator normally,

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
there's vertical metal grooves
that are all side by side,

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.547 align:middle line:84%
and there's teeth
between each layer--

00:21:30.547 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no, no.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:84%
This is completely flat and made
of some sort of polycarbonate.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.420 align:middle line:90%
And you couldn't see through it.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.852 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- you can
stand or sit in the chair.

00:21:42.852 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, there's a chair.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But you're on a
track, and it's moving.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.584 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You're on a
track, and it's moving.

00:21:50.584 --> 00:21:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what
you're describing to me

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:56.420 align:middle line:84%
sounds like an extremely
cool, futuristic tunnel

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:90%
that you're riding through.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Already, you're going
to be pretty inspired.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I mean, it
makes Epcot look like a joke.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle line:90%
No offense.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I know a guy who
built that, too.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's this--
at that time, you

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:84%
have to understand the year
that we're talking about.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.030 align:middle line:84%
In the early '90s, it was
very fantastical to be

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:90%
part of all of this.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So when you get to the end, you
go through your check station.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What does it look like?

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:84%
You were in a
tunnel, but what do

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.580 align:middle line:90%
you see once you get off the--

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.455 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's glass
doors there, seamless.

00:22:27.455 --> 00:22:29.480 align:middle line:84%
They open up like you
would see in Star Trek.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Like whoosh.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:90%
They open up.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:90%
And there's these two stations.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And if there's someone
in both stations,

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.744 align:middle line:84%
you have to wait
outside the glass.

00:22:39.744 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Other people might be
before you, checking in.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Oh, they're being
interviewed or something?

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, they're
being checked in.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And so there's
two other glass stations.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.540 align:middle line:90%
So when you go, this opens up.

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a security
check guy here,

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:90%
and a security check guy here.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what would
happen with these soldiers

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:90%
at the desks?

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:90%
What do you--

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they check your
palm print, your retina scan.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you show
them your card.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:90%
A very generic card.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.162 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And does the
soldier talk to you?

00:23:08.162 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you have questions
you have to answer?

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah,
they ask questions.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere from just a couple, or
sometimes they would be like,

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:18.200 align:middle line:90%
they're just like, go ahead.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So they were doing
this with people,

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and they had these
special animals.

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
They were dogs,
but special dogs.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Special meaning what?

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.325 align:middle line:84%
They looked
different than a dog?

00:23:30.325 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They were somehow
trained, or maybe a hybrid.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.766 align:middle line:84%
They were a little
bit larger, looked

00:23:35.766 --> 00:23:41.700 align:middle line:84%
like a German Shepherd-Mastiff
mix and a Bloodhound.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they were there,
and they were in a compartment,

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:84%
but they can smell you
as you walk by them.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:55.730 align:middle line:84%
For sure, you cannot walk by
them without them smelling you.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And they always know
how to-- they go,

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:90%
they just right away smell.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got to go
through two more doors,

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and now you're in
the locker room.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And they're gender doors.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.815 align:middle line:84%
Female locker room
and male locker room.

00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:13.374 align:middle line:84%
So in your locker room,
you take your clothes off,

00:24:13.374 --> 00:24:14.540 align:middle line:90%
and you put these scrubs on.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.880 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of like scrubs,
like a jumpsuit thing.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.906 align:middle line:84%
You go outside the
next door, which

00:24:21.906 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do now--
there's a whole wall there.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Now you're in another
corridor, and there's

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:84%
a room on the right, and that
room is where your orders are,

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and that's where you pick up
your folder and your band.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: OK.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.870 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Does somebody
tell you your orders?

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.579 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they're
usually just there.

00:24:42.579 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes there are--

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:46.664 align:middle line:90%
we call them the managers--

00:24:46.664 --> 00:24:48.330 align:middle line:84%
are in there, because
there is something

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:90%
they want to say to you.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:54.074 align:middle line:84%
They already know a half
hour away that you're coming.

00:24:54.074 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So everyone knows
everything, especially

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:84%
now that you've
got your band on.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So they come in, and they'll
say, hey, we got this, this.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:84%
They'll debrief you on like,
we got this, this, this,

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and just make sure
you do that and that.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you get out, and then
there's the white guards, now.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.920 align:middle line:90%
And they escort you.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Or if there's not a
white guard there,

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:90%
you follow the color strips.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What are color strips?

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.793 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Color strips are
when you're walking down

00:25:18.793 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful, white
hallway, there are

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.340 align:middle line:90%
wings of operating rooms, OK?

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Pressurized operating rooms.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Looks like you're getting
in a 747 jumbo jet,

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.450 align:middle line:84%
because the doors are
these cool, big, hexagon

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:90%
vacuum-sucked doors.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And the colors
correlate to the wing

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:90%
you're going work in that day.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And that just tells you how
many wings go down there.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Each wing can have
up to 30 to 50 rooms.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:90%
Of these types of vacuum rooms.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And how many floors
do you think there are?

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:51.845 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Where I was?

00:25:51.845 --> 00:25:52.645 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:25:52.645 --> 00:25:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, over 50.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:26:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Over 50 floors,
just in the medical one.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So once we understand
exactly what you're doing,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
then the number of
extraterrestrial bodies

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
that these guys have
must be staggering.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, it's unreal.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:11.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a--

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.371 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you said you never
really saw much repetition

00:26:14.371 --> 00:26:16.120 align:middle line:84%
in the type of stuff
that you saw, once we

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:90%
get to that point in the story.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:18.160 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:90%
It was different work.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: They were
always different.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.383 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Always different.

00:26:20.383 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:84%
But the thing was this,
did they grow that here?

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:23.770 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:90%
And this--

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You don't
really know, yeah.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.069 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's a
disinformation too.

00:26:26.069 --> 00:26:28.734 align:middle line:84%
Because they're going to throw a
couple of disinformation things

00:26:28.734 --> 00:26:30.310 align:middle line:84%
at you, in case one
day, I go public.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And no one is going to believe
me that I saw a 10-foot

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.880 align:middle line:90%
reptilian going down a--

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:90%
being escorted down the hallway.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You're saying
you did see a reptilian.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm saying I saw a lot
of cloned, hybrid, 3D-printed

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.360 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Whether they were conscious
or not, I do not know.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.230 align:middle line:84%
They're really good
at sci-fi effects too,

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.920 align:middle line:84%
to mess with scientists,
or to threaten them

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.930 align:middle line:84%
if they feel they're
about to go public,

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and they would talk,
when you work there.

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So the best way to do
that is to show them

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.666 align:middle line:84%
something that's
completely horrifying,

00:27:02.666 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and then they
think they're going

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.810 align:middle line:84%
to go say something, or
leave, or do whatever.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But now that they know it
really does exist, but does it?

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it real?

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Just because you see it,
doesn't mean it's real.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.730 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with the new
satellites we have with we're

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.990 align:middle line:84%
projecting stuff on cars, on the
ground, and cast shadows now.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Palpable systems that
look like I'm right here,

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:90%
but I'm really not right here.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You're saying they
could project something that

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.610 align:middle line:84%
looks just like a
car, with a shadow,

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.080 align:middle line:90%
but it's not really a car?

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.746 align:middle line:84%
It's just a projection
from a satellite?

00:27:37.746 --> 00:27:40.296 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's a projection
of a car that is palpable.

00:27:40.296 --> 00:27:41.920 align:middle line:84%
But you can go right
through it, if you

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:90%
were to really walk up to it.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But enough to put that
amount of atoms into an area

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.105 align:middle line:90%
and reflect light.

00:27:51.105 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Interesting.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Interesting.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.563 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Which is a
whole 'nother ball game.

00:27:55.563 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard for me to say,
yeah, I saw this craft,

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.121 align:middle line:84%
or I saw this ET, or I saw
this hybrid, or whatever,

00:28:02.121 --> 00:28:04.620 align:middle line:84%
unless I actually touched it,
and felt it, and walked on it,

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.300 align:middle line:90%
and tested it myself.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, since we have talked
about those types of beings

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.600 align:middle line:84%
before, instead of giving
you any front loading,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.249 align:middle line:84%
could you be more
specific in describing--

00:28:14.249 --> 00:28:16.040 align:middle line:84%
you said it was 10 feet
tall, but could you

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.456 align:middle line:84%
describe a little more about
what it actually looked like?

00:28:18.456 --> 00:28:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was just
using that as an example.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But I will describe other
ones that I've seen.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And other
ones I've seen

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:33.870 align:middle line:84%
were anywhere from 8 to 13 feet
tall down to just 22 inches.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But some of them,
you said, were alive,

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:39.260 align:middle line:84%
like they might be carrying
it as if it their prisoner?

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, yes.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason I kind
of opted out after 10 years.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt that
something wasn't going right,

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:55.070 align:middle line:84%
because one of the bodies
I received was warm.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So I knew it just,
obviously, passed.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.390 align:middle line:84%
So then I put in my thing,
got honorably discharged,

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and got out of
the contract work,

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and kept my mouth shut
for 15 years, 10 years.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So a warm
body means that it

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.630 align:middle line:84%
might have been killed right
before you had to autopsy it?

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:84%
But I have seen live
extraterrestrials face to face.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Or something
that was ET-like.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: ET-like
or hybrid or clone.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Cloned individual from an ET.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's get back now to
your colored lines.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to get us into the room
before we end this episode.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.407 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
you get to your door?

00:29:35.407 --> 00:29:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, every
corridor, don't forget,

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.730 align:middle line:84%
has the white
security guys there.

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:44.277 align:middle line:84%
So you're never going
to not see these guys.

00:29:44.277 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:90%
They're posed on every corridor.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:46.955 align:middle line:90%
Corridors can go very, very far.

00:29:46.955 --> 00:29:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There's no
private area, then.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.615 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:29:49.615 --> 00:29:50.680 align:middle line:90%
There's no private areas.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So what you've got to do
is when you get there,

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:58.330 align:middle line:84%
then you have to go through
the pressurized area

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:59.915 align:middle line:90%
to put your suit on.

00:29:59.915 --> 00:30:00.715 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's the clean
area, the sterile area.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.449 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there's
like an air lock

00:30:04.449 --> 00:30:06.280 align:middle line:84%
in between the door
and the operating room.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:07.531 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:30:07.531 --> 00:30:08.446 align:middle line:90%
And now you put more--

00:30:08.446 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And those
two technicians

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.493 align:middle line:84%
run that with the
two soldiers, right?

00:30:11.493 --> 00:30:12.370 align:middle line:90%
The white guys.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:12.730 align:middle line:90%
The white soldiers.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you have
your scrubs already,

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:84%
but then you put on
additional equipment?

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You have to put-- yeah.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.820 align:middle line:90%
You have to put on the suit.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What is the suit?

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.054 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Like a space suit.

00:30:20.054 --> 00:30:22.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
lightweight spacesuit,

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.520 align:middle line:90%
like you'd see in the movies.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.600 align:middle line:90%
It's all glass.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.360 align:middle line:84%
You have your own little
oxygen that you plug

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.250 align:middle line:90%
into the wall of your unit.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
to carry anything.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:90%
It's very lightweight.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It's made out of like a
gore-tex, polyurethane

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.880 align:middle line:90%
substance.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.360 align:middle line:90%
It's waterproof.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.360 align:middle line:90%
It's completely air proof.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have your own
air recycling in there.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.270 align:middle line:84%
You have your own
speaker comm unit.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.190 align:middle line:90%
You can communicate.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And the gloves that they
are wearing on these suits

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:84%
are the same gloves
we use in surgery.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:84%
They're very ambidextrous,
very sterile.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you will have
to use certain gloves that

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:84%
are made out of something
else that I don't know.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't want certain
latex or non-latex things

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.280 align:middle line:84%
to be touching--
to actually destroy

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.080 align:middle line:90%
whatever you're touching.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's different types
of suits for different types

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.600 align:middle line:90%
of autopsies.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So you said--

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.629 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to see this.

00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:25.920 align:middle line:84%
You have a hose that you're
going to plug into the wall

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:90%
once you go through the airlock?

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So you get to the
airlock, and you're

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.762 align:middle line:90%
escorted by the security guys.

00:31:31.762 --> 00:31:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And they open the air
lock, just like you would

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.390 align:middle line:90%
see on a Navy ship, kind of.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Like on a-- some
have clamps, and some

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.130 align:middle line:90%
have these little things.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you go in,
and you're suited,

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.160 align:middle line:90%
and you just plug your stuff in.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:49.060 align:middle line:84%
There's two cords, oxygen
and an electrical comm cord.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.556 align:middle line:84%
And you can still
hear them if they

00:31:50.556 --> 00:31:52.722 align:middle line:84%
wanted to talk to you in
there without that, in case

00:31:52.722 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:90%
it failed.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.966 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So could
you just briefly

00:31:54.966 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:84%
describe what it looks like
once you're inside the OR now?

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's seamless.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:04.460 align:middle line:84%
It's got a white-pinkish tinge
to the walls and everything.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.780 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of oval.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And all of the entire
walls actually have--

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.640 align:middle line:84%
can come out in different
types of sections.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.454 align:middle line:84%
And the sections might be...
the body will be on this board.

00:32:21.454 --> 00:32:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the other section walls
will have all these other tools

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.630 align:middle line:90%
you're going to need to do it.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:30.360 align:middle line:84%
To do whatever you're
gathering or for the testing.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So once you actually
see these salmon filets--

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.770 align:middle line:84%
you said it started
with salmon filets,

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:41.820 align:middle line:84%
but then you upgraded at some
point to an arm with a hand.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.340 align:middle line:84%
What was the time interval
between salmon filets

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.827 align:middle line:84%
and arms and then
eventually, full bodies?

00:32:46.827 --> 00:32:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Could we talk about
that for a second?

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:51.720 align:middle line:84%
That took about, I
think, 16 months.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.800 align:middle line:84%
You get three to six
months security upgrades

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.464 align:middle line:84%
if you behave and
keep your mouth shut.

00:32:59.464 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it happens fast, because
they go through so many people.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:02.710 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted
to learn this.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.360 align:middle line:90%
I was so captivated by it.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So I did what they
wanted me to do.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And then it got more
and more stranger,

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and I would get better
and better samples.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.714 align:middle line:84%
And it was frustrating
because you're not

00:33:17.714 --> 00:33:19.380 align:middle line:84%
allowed to ask, well,
what is this from?

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:20.885 align:middle line:90%
Or how do you get it?

00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Or-- you're just there to do the
sampling and get out, you know?

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.600 align:middle line:90%
And then once the bodies came--

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:84%
that was probably
after maybe 10 months--

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:84%
when partial bodies,
not full bodies.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get full bodies
until way at the end,

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and then I got out because I
got emotional about it, I guess.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you describe for
us the very first partial body

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.430 align:middle line:90%
that you saw?

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.240 align:middle line:90%
What did it look like?

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And we'll end the
episode with that.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.860 align:middle line:90%
It was a leopard-colored skin.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.260 align:middle line:90%
It was the torso.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:90%
It looked like it got blown up.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.270 align:middle line:90%
And it had reptilian skin.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:04.890 align:middle line:84%
It had normal body parts,
like we have on our insides.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So I did see a
spleen, a heart, lung.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.229 align:middle line:84%
The face was too
distorted and destroyed,

00:34:13.229 --> 00:34:15.270 align:middle line:84%
so I couldn't tell you
what the face looked like.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:20.130 align:middle line:84%
But it had perfect, normal
bone structure like we do.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:84%
And it was just-- the
skin was beautiful.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:27.460 align:middle line:84%
It was iridescent
blue leopard skin.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:31.210 align:middle line:84%
It reminded me of growing
up in the Everglades

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:35.620 align:middle line:84%
with the leopard frogs, where
they had those round circles,

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.100 align:middle line:90%
and peacock feathers mixed.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:43.644 align:middle line:84%
That color-- that
distinct, round--

00:34:43.644 --> 00:34:45.820 align:middle line:90%
it was very smooth skin.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did it scare
you the first time

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:48.929 align:middle line:90%
you got a partial body?

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Were you like, oh my god,
what's going on here?

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:90%
I was in shock.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.440 align:middle line:84%
They're measuring my heart rate,
by the way, the whole time.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.600 align:middle line:84%
They're measuring
how I'm reacting.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So I kept cool, and they didn't
ask me, hey, are you all right,

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:09.490 align:middle line:84%
one time, because I was
only allowed to operate

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.590 align:middle line:90%
on one part of the body.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
know more, you know?

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
certain tissues,

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I realized, from clones, than
from real extraterrestrials,

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and from humans, that the
cloned tissue isn't as

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.270 align:middle line:90%
strong as the ones they grow.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Our tissue's really
strong, but...

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And depending on how long
they've been, of course, dead,

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:37.690 align:middle line:84%
or how long it's been frozen,
or whatever conditions they

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:38.890 align:middle line:90%
have had it in.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But when you get fresh stuff,
and sometimes they'll tell you

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:44.170 align:middle line:90%
it is, sometimes they won't.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell that the ones
that are fake are more friable.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.470 align:middle line:84%
So that means you barely try
to get something out of them,

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:54.700 align:middle line:90%
it just, like, melts away.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
interesting dynamic as far

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:58.750 align:middle line:90%
as the tissues are concerned.

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.531 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Emery, why do you
feel like coming forward today?

00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:03.280 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
events that have just

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.280 align:middle line:84%
happened that have impelled
you to finally break

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:84%
your silence after a
decade of me telling you,

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.910 align:middle line:84%
hey man, you really
ought to come forward?

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you know, I
didn't think that's up to me.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm a very
just neutral--

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:23.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't even watch a lot--

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't watch a
lot of these shows,

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and I like to stay neutral,
so nothing influences me.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:39.632 align:middle line:90%
And recently-- [SIGHS]

00:36:39.632 --> 00:36:44.000 align:middle line:90%


00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.960 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's got--

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.750 align:middle line:84%
it's been getting
a little violent.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We have a photograph
of a head-on collision

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.540 align:middle line:84%
that you suffered
30 minutes after I

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:57.930 align:middle line:84%
leaked more of your
information in an article.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.269 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:36:59.269 --> 00:37:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you're
very lucky to be alive.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:03.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's--

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.944 align:middle line:90%
I've been shot at, been stabbed.

00:37:05.944 --> 00:37:07.110 align:middle line:90%
Been jumped by three agents.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.381 align:middle line:90%
Got my butt kicked.

00:37:09.381 --> 00:37:11.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's-- I've
been through it all.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.350 align:middle line:90%
But it was not--

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:17.660 align:middle line:84%
it was-- I don't believe it
was because of that stuff.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.335 align:middle line:84%
I think when they
knew I went energy,

00:37:20.335 --> 00:37:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and I started doing more
of the energy stuff,

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:26.450 align:middle line:90%
they really got angry.

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I lost everything.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.720 align:middle line:90%
They broke into my house.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, rammed my gate,
my concrete gate down,

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:90%
where all this stuff was stored.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And cut into the walls
where things and safes

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.120 align:middle line:84%
were hidden that you can only
know by satellite, using--

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.950 align:middle line:84%
these people definitely had
perfect satellite imagery of--

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I know about the satellites
very well and the stuff

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.450 align:middle line:90%
they can do with them.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And they can look
into every brick

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.070 align:middle line:90%
and every wall of the house.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:05.100 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm very glad that you
made it here alive,

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.750 align:middle line:90%
that we're doing this now.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try to get
as much on camera as we can,

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:90%
for your safety.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:15.840 align:middle line:90%
And we will be back next time.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.730 align:middle line:90%
This is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:21.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
here with "Paul," who we now

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:23.280 align:middle line:90%
have revealed is Emery Smith.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for watching.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:28.040 align:middle line:10%
