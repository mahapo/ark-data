>>EMERY SMITH: Today,
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.937 align:middle line:10%
we are joined by Victoria
Whitney, a Doctor of Science

00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:25.520 align:middle line:10%
and a retired member
of the Department

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.210 align:middle line:10%
of Defense, United States Navy.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing
the Orion Empire.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Victoria, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VICTORIA WHITNEY: Well,
it's nice to be here, Emery.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Give us a brief
history of the Orion Empire.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Sure.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:84%
They believe that they've been
around longer than anybody else.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to say
whether that's true or not.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if you talk
to each one of them,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.610 align:middle line:90%
they say the same thing.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But they did start
off as an empire.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.545 align:middle line:84%
They believed that
whatever transpired early

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:54.170 align:middle line:84%
in their history
meant that they needed

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to be a more solid unity
that could move forward,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.600 align:middle line:90%
take over places.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And when they say
take over, I don't

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:84%
know if that means colonize or
whether they were just taking

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:90%
planets from other species.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what that-- they
came from a violent past,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.498 align:middle line:84%
so that could very
much be part of that.

00:01:13.498 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What type of time frame
are we looking at, Victoria?

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, so we're
in the millions of years.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.350 align:middle line:84%
There again, 22
million to 40 million.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.180 align:middle line:90%
They have a long period of that.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:84%
They were a product
of many wars.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.230 align:middle line:84%
They are a product of
very mixed lineages.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So there again, just
like Pleiadians,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.772 align:middle line:84%
they understand that it's going
to happen, Melchizedek, Lyran,

00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:36.980 align:middle line:90%
all those different lineages.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that
they also have lineages

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:84%
mixed with other inhabitants
that they've met along the way.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So they'll talk about the fact
that there are some reptilian

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:90%
species amongst them.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:84%
There are some other species
that they'll go into,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Taygetans, some
animalian species.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't opposed
to mixing lineages.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
But that's what helped
them to grow their empire.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that this
empire has existed for so long

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that that is the
recognized entity.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:84%
But then we also have
other empires out there.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So we all know what happens
when each one thinks

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:84%
that that's the one that
should be in control of things.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So they have a lot
of different ways

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
in which they really
talk about their empire.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Their main city is Asrylias.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's their capital city.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
basis of their monarchy,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better
word, is the empire.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And let's also
touch base for the viewers

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.023 align:middle line:84%
the amount of species that
this empire is made up of.

00:02:48.023 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, you
have to understand,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
too, they're a trade center,
an international trade center.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So they're getting species
from all over the cosmos coming

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And they've worked
out deals with them,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and they've worked out
relationships with them.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And so they are very
much a mixed lineage.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen
pictures, and it's very

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.030 align:middle line:84%
clear there are subtle
differences amongst them.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll say,
if it's a true Orion,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
have the longer face,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to have
the more receded eye socket.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:10%
They have a very
specific colored skin.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.452 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
variations after that.

00:03:31.452 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
the Lyran Wars?

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
How did that shape the
history of the Orion Empire?

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well,
it displaced them.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And they said they were already
space explorers at that place.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:90%
So that did not stop them.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
was it displaced them

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
from their planets, and
a lot of their planets

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:90%
were totally obliterated.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:84%
It forced them to go out
into other constellations.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:90%
They said they got there.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them had other
species living on them.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:90%
That was the same.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:90%
The Pleiadians had the same.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
was is, basically,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:84%
because they were
an empire, they

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:90%
had to have ownership of it.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And so they talk about
not necessarily displacing

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:84%
the species that were there,
but incorporating them

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:90%
into their empire.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And so this began
to grow rapidly,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and then they spread
out to other planets.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing occurred
over and over again.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So they felt like that was
their ownership then of very

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:90%
large sectors of the cosmos.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.263 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, they still
call themselves an empire.

00:04:34.263 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And they still
talk about the fact

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.942 align:middle line:84%
that they own so
much of the cosmos.

00:04:37.942 --> 00:04:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned
earlier, Asrylias.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you elaborate
on that for us?

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Sure.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:90%
So this is like our capitals.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:90%
We have capital cities.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:90%
This is their capital city.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
This is really the
foundation for their empire.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:90%
It's very large.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:90%
It's very progressive.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:10%
It's inhabited by many, many
different species, not just

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:10%
Orions, but they have a large
reptoid population there.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Just about anybody, I
guess, comes through there.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's because they have
this international trade center

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:90%
that's located in Asrylias.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.700 align:middle line:84%
The city, they say,
is very progressive.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:84%
There again, it's a
regenerative type city,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:84%
just like it was
in the Pleiadians.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:90%
It's run by the AI.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.945 align:middle line:90%
It's autonomous.

00:05:24.945 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:90%
And the fact that it came--

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So they trust the AI.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.947 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: They trust
the AI, and it can

00:05:28.947 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:90%
make decisions for the city.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And my question was is well,
what kind of decisions, right?

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, there's
no crime, right?

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: There's no--

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well,
they have more crime

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:84%
there because it's an
international trade.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And they say that they don't
question the trades that

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:90%
come through there.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked about the fact
that there's human trafficking

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and there's the selling
of human DNA and all

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.130 align:middle line:90%
these different things.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure based on
that, that there's

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:84%
pockets within there where that
is very much a large business

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:90%
that's occurring.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:84%
But for all intents and
purposes, like I say,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:84%
this trade center is the
dominant feature in Asrylias.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they talk about how
they went out of their way

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:90%
to make it very appealing.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
So they made
basically a waterway

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:84%
that travels through the
different sectors in there.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can travel
on these boats.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And the water is meant to
keep the energies effervescing

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.310 align:middle line:84%
through the trade center
to keep people calm

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and balanced, not
getting into areas where

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:90%
they don't want those tensions.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:52.152 align:middle line:84%
It's very much these huge spires
and a layered type look as well.

00:06:52.152 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there war
going on in between this?

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they talk
about trade wars happening.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So I would imagine that that's
the basis for what that is.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Here, it is an empire that wants
to be in charge of everything.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you have other
entities coming in that

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:90%
likewise have the same mindset.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think they see
more of it there

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:90%
than the Pleiadeans would see.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:84%
What I noticed was
in talking about it,

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.780 align:middle line:84%
while we say they
try to stay balanced,

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
they do have an attitude
about some things.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And the attitude
is that, how dare

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.570 align:middle line:84%
these interlopers come
in and try to take over

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:90%
what they've set up.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But there again, a lot
of it is nanotechnology.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So anything that any
other species has created

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.367 align:middle line:90%
goes through this trade center.

00:07:40.367 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How important
is that trade center?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.492 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: It's very important.

00:07:43.492 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
They have four of them
throughout the cosmos.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
So it's very important to them.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And they say that
there's one in Centauri

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and then two others
and then this one.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:90%
And this one's very large.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.497 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you talk about
how they travel between?

00:07:57.497 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: They
use the-- what they

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:90%
call jumpgates or wormholes.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's nothing to get
from one place to another.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you explain
how the craft makes the--

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.462 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: My
understanding-- so this

00:08:09.462 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:84%
goes back to what we were
talking about the bioship before

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:90%
with the Andromedans.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So as it opens up--
so there's an address

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:90%
that they put in there.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
As it opens up this
gateway, the ship

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:84%
forms sort of this
spiral energy field.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And so as they're moving
forward, the spiral is keeping--

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and what it's doing is it's
keeping everything spaced away

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:84%
from the ship itself,
which makes it--

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:84%
ability to do FTL
through the jumpgate.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they can
go from one point

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:84%
to another in a matter
of very short time.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.690 align:middle line:84%
We're talking minutes
rather than years.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For the
viewers, FTL means--

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Faster Than Light.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it goes faster
than that because one of the--

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I asked them to give us a way
in which we could view it.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And so he says, well, think
of something that can do 1,020

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:90%
miles per second.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:84%
That would be hard
for us to imagine.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, that's
the interesting part

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:84%
of the science behind
this information,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
that is not-- we

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
don't even have a
way to describe it

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:84%
I was just trying to get them
to give me some idea of what

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.130 align:middle line:90%
that looked like.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And my brain is going,
yeah, I can't get there.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But it's fascinating
because really, we make it hard.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Remember,
everything is energy.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.390 align:middle line:84%
That's one of their
core premises.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
going, I don't know

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.190 align:middle line:84%
why you can't understand
that you can displace energy.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Instantly.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Instantly.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:90%
That it doesn't know time.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And so if you go
with that thought,

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:84%
then you can understand how
they can get from point A

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:84%
to point B in such a
short period of time.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So they'll talk about sometimes
with the trade center,

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:84%
they need a specific product
because a large buyer is coming

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:84%
in or something like that,
especially when they're

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:84%
talking about having to
get parts for other ships

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.880 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Then they'll say, we'll
just FTL over to this one

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and pick up the parts
and bring them back.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:84%
But this trade center has
anything you can think of.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:90%
And I asked them.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, so do you use
the same food synthesizer?

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.765 align:middle line:84%
And so the Orions eat a
lot of the same foods,

00:10:36.765 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:90%
just like Pleiadians.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:90%
So it's a gel, right?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
But they say they have a lot of
species that come through there

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:90%
that have to have solid foods.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:10%
And so they have a variety
of different things

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.530 align:middle line:10%
like that that are
available for them.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So imagine going to
a huge marketplace.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have
marketplaces here

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.300 align:middle line:84%
that are different
across regions.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.420 align:middle line:84%
So our marketplace
here in the US

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:84%
would not be the
same as over in China

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
or someplace like--
so you go there,

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:84%
and you see these different
things that you're not

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.750 align:middle line:90%
used to seeing.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So it would be very
much the same thing

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.850 align:middle line:84%
there that we would see other
types of animals or fruits

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables, things like that
that we're not familiar with.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.970 align:middle line:10%
And so they say, this
is a large opportunity

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:10%
for a lot of different
people to come in.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's five
of these districts?

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: There's
actually four total trade

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:84%
centers that this corporation
has built, which is interesting.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But they're all
different, like you said.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.975 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: They're
all different.

00:11:37.975 --> 00:11:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just owned by
the same entities.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And they run these
across the cosmos.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is what supports
the empire, so to speak.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:90%
And so it's huge.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.615 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I would love to go there,
but I couldn't even

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:84%
imagine what it
takes for something

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:84%
like that to continue
to operate at the volume

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:84%
that it has to operate at
and the number of people

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:90%
that would go through there.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.227 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing millions
of people through there.

00:12:11.227 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, we're talking
about all these trade

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:84%
centers and all this going back
and forth, different species.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.208 align:middle line:84%
What is the monetary
system like with that?

00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they have
a credit system, which means

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:90%
that there's no commodity.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.308 align:middle line:90%
So here, we have a commodity.

00:12:25.308 --> 00:12:27.350 align:middle line:84%
We have gold or silver
that's supposed to support

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.770 align:middle line:90%
our dollar or our currency.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:90%
They don't have that.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:90%
It's on a credit system.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what the value
of that credit system would be.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's universal
across the cosmos.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them have
either this little disk

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.960 align:middle line:84%
that they use to
transfer credits.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Some of them have a--

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a
tattoo on the back

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:84%
of their hand, various
reasons that they

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.685 align:middle line:90%
would have some way to--

00:12:55.685 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Interesting.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Measurement, right?

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Some
measurement system.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it seems
to be universal,

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to be
very workable for them

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have to
go do some sort of exchange

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:08.870 align:middle line:90%
like we do here.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
You would have to exchange your
currency for wherever you're at.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
go through that.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Weapons go through there.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Drugs go through there.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.950 align:middle line:84%
The exchange of DNAs
go through there.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.410 align:middle line:10%
It's just like this
huge marketing system.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.360 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:84%
If you needed a
specific type of drug,

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.820 align:middle line:84%
you got to have a
prescription for it here.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.410 align:middle line:90%
They don't have that there.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So looking at this,
you have to realize

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.770 align:middle line:84%
the enormity of what's happening
in one of these trade centers

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:90%
and what that does for a city.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So here, like I say, they
have an AI that's autonomous,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.450 align:middle line:90%
that makes decisions for itself.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Talk about trusting.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why are we not
included with all that here?

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, I think
that they believe--

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and we've had
conversations about this--

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.470 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't learned to
be responsible with things.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.130 align:middle line:90%
We still act like children.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And as intelligent as we
want to believe we are,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:90%
we cannot match what they know.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that
really comes down

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
to it is, would we be
responsible for things?

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Why do we think of making
a weapon out of everything

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:90%
that we come across?

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.590 align:middle line:84%
That's not a normal
course of thought.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So I think what they look at
is that we're not quite ready.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not so sure
they were ready for it

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:84%
when they started getting
other species in because

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:84%
what are they
bringing to the table?

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.830 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
they knew that.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I think what they did was
they went into it and said,

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:84%
we're an extremely
intelligent empire.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
We have been around
for millions of years.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:90%
We've probably seen it all.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
everything they thought.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
happened was is they

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:84%
said we can deal with
anything that comes along.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be
able to because we

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.450 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough technology
nor enough understanding of how

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:90%
things really work.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.680 align:middle line:84%
When we get to the point where
we start understanding really

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.590 align:middle line:84%
that energy is in
charge, not us, then I

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.877 align:middle line:84%
think that will change
the way in which we think.

00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how
does the Orion Empire

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
deal with diplomacy
and the trade markets?

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, what are
they going to get out of it?

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.490 align:middle line:90%
That's always the bottom line.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.032 align:middle line:84%
What are they going
to get out of it?

00:15:21.032 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Those Orions--

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Indeed.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, would we not
all do the same thing, right?

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't do something going into
it while we're doing this just

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:90%
for the benefit of everybody.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.260 align:middle line:84%
We want to know what we're
going to get out of it.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And they likewise
want to know what

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.840 align:middle line:90%
they're going to get out of it.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.257 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they
wouldn't have gone

00:15:39.257 --> 00:15:41.970 align:middle line:84%
to the means of
bringing something up

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:84%
like that, where they knew they
were going to have exposure

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:84%
to other species, where
they knew that there's

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:84%
that potential for a war to
break out because you're having

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.160 align:middle line:90%
species come from other places.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.332 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:15:52.332 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:90%
All the time, yeah.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And how do they know it wasn't
going to affect their empire?

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:84%
They talk about empires
that wound up getting

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.460 align:middle line:90%
enslaved by other empires.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
How do they know that that
wasn't going to happen to them?

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:84%
But they're confident
enough to believe

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that they have evolved
far enough that they

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.670 align:middle line:90%
can deal with those instances.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how do they resolve
conflicts in the Orion Empire

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.040 align:middle line:84%
with all these species
coming in and out?

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah,
well, we go back

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:90%
to their five core premises.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
They tell the story about the
Merlinians having to come and--

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:84%
way back in their history
and teach them a better way.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Time travelers?

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they
believe interdimensional.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: OK.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And what they believe is
that the universal source--

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.332 align:middle line:84%
because they all believe
in the universal source,

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:90%
intelligent energy.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.810 align:middle line:84%
They believe that the universal
source created the Merlinians

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:84%
to go forward and
continue to teach

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:90%
that it is about the energy.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And so they have
stories where they

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:84%
talk about a particular
Merlinian coming and teaching

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:84%
spirituality to them and showing
them that there was a better

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.170 align:middle line:84%
way, and that they
should all convert

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.253 align:middle line:84%
to higher energies
and everything

00:17:03.253 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
these days, about waking up

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:90%
and higher frequencies.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.829 align:middle line:84%
But this Merlinian
in particular was

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.380 align:middle line:84%
very successful
during that period

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
of conveying how
important that was

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
across all of the
species that were

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:90%
living in the third dimension.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And so they begin
to unite together.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what created
their core premises for them.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:90%
And so they go back to that.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is another species.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I have to remember
that it has value.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:90%
It's contributing to the energy.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And so they begin
to develop a system

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:84%
in place using the same
principles of the Merlinian

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to tell
people that let's

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.910 align:middle line:84%
talk about it from a
frequency point of view.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how we
can align with one another.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
important to them

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:84%
is being able to align
with these other species

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and include them in
the connective thought

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:84%
process of what's occurring
in the cosmos itself.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And looking at it that
way, it expands your mind

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:84%
to say that whatever petty
little thing we were talking

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.140 align:middle line:84%
about down here really
has, in the bigger

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.190 align:middle line:90%
scheme of things, no place.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
how they begin

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.310 align:middle line:84%
to deal with things is by going
back to their teachings of what

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
the Merlinian had brought
to them in the beginning.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Are the Merlinians--

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.487 align:middle line:84%
you said they're
interdimensional.

00:18:27.487 --> 00:18:28.287 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:18:28.287 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they still
part of the Orion Empire?

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.157 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, so
this is interesting.

00:18:32.157 --> 00:18:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I was [INAUDIBLE],
which is part of that--

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Merlinians came and grouped
together [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So in our belief system, we
understood the same thing,

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.660 align:middle line:84%
that they were sent
forward to tell basically

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:84%
the reminder about
the universal source.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:90%
So I grew up with that.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.317 align:middle line:84%
And the belief has always
been that they're still here.

00:18:56.317 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course, they are.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
If I'm teaching today,
that's part of my heritage

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:90%
is to be part of that Merlinian.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And I find that most people,
when they seek us out, I

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.900 align:middle line:84%
don't go out and
advertise and say, hey,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:90%
have I got something for you.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:90%
They come to us.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And usually, we find out that
they have that core principle

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:90%
within them as well.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So does that make
them Merlinian?

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Of course it does, because it's
just like any other lineage.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.700 align:middle line:90%
It gets passed down.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.040 align:middle line:90%
So they're still here.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just that sometimes we
forget what our purpose is.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And so this has to
remind us that we're here

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.330 align:middle line:84%
to remember to say that
everything's about energy.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:90%
It's about our lineage.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:90%
It's about the law of one.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Those are all the important
principles and everything.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.828 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I try to
add them into everything

00:19:47.828 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:84%
is to make everybody understand
that none of that has changed.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:84%
It's been here as long
as anybody can remember.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And later, we'll
talk about Starseeds.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.550 align:middle line:90%
That's all part of that process.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But the Merlinians
were sent for-- they

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:84%
were created specifically
to go out and keep

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
that information
alive and to make sure

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that every being that
they came in contact with

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.440 align:middle line:84%
understood how important
that was to their system.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:90%
And it isn't just a belief.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
If we're an energy, then
it's part of that energy.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
their whole purpose

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:84%
was to be able to
convey those things.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:90%
And so knowing that--

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:90%
here's the Orions.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:84%
They still use
those core premises

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:84%
to solve their problems,
to understand that, yes, it

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
is an energy, and that we're all
connected to the same energy.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:46.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have to get away from
that damaging one over another

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.290 align:middle line:90%
when we're all the same thing.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was really the
teaching of the Merlinian

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:84%
was that we're all made
from these energies,

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and that those energies
are all interconnected.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So why would we take
some petty moment

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:84%
to try to cause damage
across an energy?

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense to them.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that how the Orion
empire was basically built?

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.400 align:middle line:84%
They were able to come
together on those core premises

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and understand that they were
collectively something bigger.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, that went
on for quite a while.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But then once the
war started and they

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
began to see other things,
some of them got fragmented.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.340 align:middle line:90%
We have that happen here.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Look how many religions
we have on this planet.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:90%
That's because of fragmentation.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they had
somewhat the same thing.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:90%
But now they've come back.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:84%
They've said, our true
course was meant to be this.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
We were better as the collective
than when we were fragmented.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they, over the
course of millions of years,

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.988 align:middle line:84%
have come back
around to understand.

00:21:55.988 --> 00:21:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how do they balance
their spiritual and political

00:21:58.530 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:90%
roles?

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: They're spread
throughout the cosmos.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.510 align:middle line:90%
You mean--

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
They're influenced by many
different other species.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:90%
And so it's just like here.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:84%
When you're in those
moments of spirituality,

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.080 align:middle line:90%
that's what you're practicing.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
When you're outside those
moments of spirituality,

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:84%
other things influence,
and you begin

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:90%
to sort of do your own thing.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's very much
what happened to them was

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:90%
that they were very spiritual.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:84%
That just comes with
evolution, higher frequencies.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.980 align:middle line:90%
You look at things differently.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But then as the
influences begin to occur,

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.950 align:middle line:84%
then they sort of walked
away from some of that.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
they had to have

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:90%
a reawakening of what that was.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And that really brought
them much stronger

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
together because they went
back to that principle.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well, what was that?

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well,
it happened to be

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that they had a war in which
they were opposed by Draconians.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And some of them went
that direction, which

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:90%
then began to split the empire.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that
the strength of who we are

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:90%
is being diluted.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided to
have this reawakening.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And that went across
all of the federation

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
that no, we're
stronger by realizing

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.010 align:middle line:84%
that we're part of the universe,
not separate from the universe.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they went
through that reawakening

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.437 align:middle line:84%
to discover just what
a large part they play

00:23:30.437 --> 00:23:31.645 align:middle line:90%
in the universe, a ceremony--

00:23:31.645 --> 00:23:33.353 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
humans here on Earth?

00:23:33.353 --> 00:23:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Are we all from this lineage?

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So we all have some
type of Starseed lineage in us.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:90%
They're very aware of that.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we talk
about the cosmic identity.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:90%
That's the origination energy.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And so you need to
know who you are.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And we just-- cosmic
identity for everybody

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:90%
we come in contact with.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And people will go, oh my gosh,
that says exactly who I am.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:84%
That's because
you're that energy.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.380 align:middle line:90%
You can't change who you are.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:90%
You can change personalities.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:90%
You can change this vessel.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot change that
energy for who it really is.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:90%
And it has both sides.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Whether you want to call
it good, bad, dark light,

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.170 align:middle line:84%
however you want to turn that,
positive or negative, whatever,

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:84%
there's a balance that has
to occur in that energy.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
both sides, and one

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:84%
will be more
accentuated over another

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:90%
based on your experiences.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.150 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the
matter is that they so

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:84%
believe this, that
this is who they are.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.520 align:middle line:84%
They say that they are
a spectrum of energies,

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and that the
spectrum of energies

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.810 align:middle line:84%
makes them who they
are, and that when

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:84%
they come in contact
with somebody else,

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:84%
those spectrums line
up in specific ways.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And that makes them
be able to communicate

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:84%
on a very different
level than just

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:90%
this vessel-to-vessel level.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they're
telepathic as well.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So lying is unheard of, which I
found interesting because people

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:90%
are human trafficking, right?

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:90%
You can't lie about it.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So how are you
interacting with that?

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:90%
And so I've asked her before.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.570 align:middle line:90%
I said, doesn't that appall you?

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, of
course, it appalls us.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:90%
But that's their experience.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.140 align:middle line:90%
We're very clear.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:90%
This is bad.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.610 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And they don't view
things that way.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So that core premise
is very much there

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
understand how it works.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they're
going to deal with things.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:43.430 align:middle line:84%
They're going to look at
it and say, to what degree

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:84%
should we be concerned
about what it is?

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even
know how that gets

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.730 align:middle line:84%
figured in the scheme of
things, because we're emotional.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:90%
They are not.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Our emotions drive us.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.770 align:middle line:84%
They go more on what
they call biocognitive.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that
there is a knowledge that

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:90%
is ingrained within them.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is what's
interacting with everything

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:90%
that they come in contact with.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're very concerned
about that aspect.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.792 align:middle line:90%
And we should be concerned too.

00:26:21.792 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:84%
We talk about Alzheimer's and
dementia and different things

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:25.050 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.270 align:middle line:90%
That's unheard of for them.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't have those
types of diseases.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And so when they're looking at
that biocognitive aspect of it,

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:84%
they're looking at, where does
the truth lie and the belief

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:41.070 align:middle line:90%
that you have created?

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.412 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
start looking at it--

00:26:43.412 --> 00:26:45.203 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're talking
about judgment now.

00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Indeed, indeed.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they would be
appalled if we said,

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:84%
you're a very judgy
species, right?

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.210 align:middle line:90%
They think we are.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, right.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And so when we start looking
at things from that light,

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:84%
then we start realizing that
it would be very hard for them

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.010 align:middle line:84%
to understand how we could
think the way we think,

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:12.640 align:middle line:84%
given the way that their
spirituality allows them to be.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.475 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd say is I'm
all for spirituality.

00:27:17.475 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe that every person was
put on this planet for a reason.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a purpose
for each of us.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And who decides whose
purpose is better?

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I look at
this and say, I think

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.590 align:middle line:84%
they've won that part over,
that they understand that,

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that we're all here for
some type of contribution

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:90%
to the bigger scheme of things.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
where they're at.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And so whether they call it
the empire or whether they

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.545 align:middle line:84%
call it universal source,
whatever the case may be,

00:27:48.545 --> 00:27:50.170 align:middle line:84%
that's really where
they're coming from

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:51.840 align:middle line:84%
is that that's what
they're contributing

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:84%
to is that creative
process that allows

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:90%
it to continue to be creative.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that they learn
that at such an early age.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Millions of years,
what's an early age?

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But they learn that
at such an early age,

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and we're still trying
to learn that right now.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
making great progress.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:84%
0.02% of the planet
has woken up.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.010 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:84%
You got, what, 9.2 billion
people on the planet right now?

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a very small amount.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, is that
it has to start somewhere.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, it's a
great trajectory for us

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.440 align:middle line:90%
to hope and think about.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we are going.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.118 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:32.118 --> 00:28:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Thank you for sharing.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: I enjoyed
the conversations

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:37.860 align:middle line:90%
that I had with them.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought they were
very enlightening.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:84%
