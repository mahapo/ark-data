00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.670 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host George Noory,
and I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Disinformation-- it's used
daily with the public,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:90%
but also within secret programs.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.167 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I mean, these
disinformation programs--

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:90%
specifically, what are they?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: A
disinformation program

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:10%
is run constantly all the
time through the military,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:10%
in the public's eye, and also
in compartmentalized projects,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:10%
especially when it has
to do with intelligence,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:10%
and things that are trying to
hide from other compartments.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So one of the first
times I was ever

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.720 align:middle line:90%
introduced to disinformation--

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.470 align:middle line:84%
it was actually
told to me that all

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:84%
of the beings that I worked on--
about 3% of them will be fake.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.017 align:middle line:84%
And that I will not know
what is and what isn't.

00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not allowed to ask that
either, if this is a fake one.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.596 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
thrown in there to see

00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to be
keeping your mouth shut

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and to monitor other people
that are in the projects to see.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:84%
You might come and look
at a craft, let's say.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And they might put
something on the craft that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
doesn't fit in just right,
just to see how you're going

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:90%
to react to it with everyone.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Even though you're not part
of that exact piece of craft,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.140 align:middle line:84%
just to see the response, to
listen to you at the cafeteria,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:84%
to listen to you on your phone
calls and things like this.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So disinformation is
actually part of the contract

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.940 align:middle line:84%
that you sign when
you're down in there,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
getting disinformation,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:90%
but you will be exposed to it.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do they ever
try to correct it?

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, not
so much correct it.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't ever tell
you what they did.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
A good example of this is-- this
happens a lot and I've heard it

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
not only through myself, but
many of my colleagues working

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.690 align:middle line:84%
in this underground facility,
where you'll see a being maybe

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.975 align:middle line:84%
10 meters away or a little bit
more, where it's just out of--

00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Just far enough--

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Just far enough.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: --away, right?

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Like two
security guards

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:84%
walking a reptilian-looking
creature through the hallway

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.955 align:middle line:90%
and making it very obvious.

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It could be somebody
in a costume to trick you?

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:90%
And this is just in case.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
If you do defect
when you get out,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.180 align:middle line:84%
or you do things like
this, that people

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
aren't going to believe you.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.090 align:middle line:84%
They want you to
seem a little kooky.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
They want to see if you're
going to take this route,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and make a book about it,
and explain what you saw,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and if you're going to
share that information

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
with other countries, and
agencies, and things like this.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
always followed when

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:84%
you get out of these projects
for about 25, 30 years.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And you do get visits
every now and then,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:84%
just to let you know
that they are watching,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and that you haven't
messed up too much.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And I never say anything that's
going to endanger the public,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:84%
or myself, or you, for
instance, or the organizations

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.317 align:middle line:90%
that I work with right now.

00:03:06.317 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the stuff that I
talk about, believe it or not,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of old school, old
knowledge from the late '80s

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:90%
and early '90s.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So they're more upset
about me talking about ways

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.350 align:middle line:84%
to cure yourself or ways
to create free energy,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.530 align:middle line:84%
than me talking about
extraterrestrials whatsoever.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are these
disinformation programs

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:90%
also aimed at the public?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:90%
A lot of the things--

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:84%
like for instance,
the Roswell crash.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:84%
The Roswell crash was a
great example of that.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
First, you had the honest
to God truth come out

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:84%
about all the documentation
and then following up,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.819 align:middle line:90%
oh, weather balloon.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
All these things are there
to mislead the public.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They're
dummies, right?

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Dummies.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it's-- there's
people actually hired on these

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
specific, compartmentalized
projects to write things up

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and to leave files around to see
if you're going to go open it,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and look at it, or look
it up on the computer,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and read something that's
actually completely fake.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why do they have
these disinformation programs?

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.099 align:middle line:84%
Is it primarily to distort
the fact from the truth?

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Not necessarily.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.874 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time it's for
intelligence and security

00:04:15.874 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:84%
of the people, all the
employees, and everyone

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:90%
working for them.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They
don't trust anyone.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.141 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They don't--
no one trusts no one.

00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So they do that as far as
keeping everyone in check.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
a lot of these stories

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:84%
actually leak out to the media
or to the public by choice.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
They allow this
stuff to slip out.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
They allow this person
to have this file.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And then this person
five years later

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:90%
releases it to someone else.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they make it
into a world known,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.070 align:middle line:84%
because it has the seal of
the United States Army on it.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.467 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:04:51.467 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And I hate to say that.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
paperwork out there

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:84%
that I know my colleagues
have had in the past--

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:90%
may or may not be real.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to decipher
what is and what isn't.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it might be a real
document with a seal on it,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:84%
but it might not
be the real letter.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.760 align:middle line:90%
It might be a staged event.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Gosh, they
go to all this extreme?

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.689 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Who comes up
with these programs?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Who develops these?

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they have
actually organizations

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that are specifically
hired and contracted out

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.010 align:middle line:84%
to write storylines
and think way ahead

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:90%
into the future, George.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Not just like, oh, well,
we want this message

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.420 align:middle line:90%
to go out next month.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking 5, 10, 15,
20 years, that they

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:84%
have just an amazing
amount of disinformation

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:84%
ready to be distributed, not
only amongst the military

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:84%
itself, amongst
their commanders,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.010 align:middle line:84%
but to the general
public as well.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.842 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Is it propaganda?

00:05:48.842 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it is
propaganda in a way,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
these things-- maybe

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:84%
they need to fight an unknown
terrorist to make money

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.110 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of these
organizations.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they need to
go to war for something.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they need to plan
on a fake space invasion,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:90%
or an asteroid may be coming.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So we need money to
go up there and build

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:84%
these special satellites with
missiles on them, let's say,

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:84%
when we already have
all that stuff up there.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just a way to shift the
general public's attention,

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:84%
because there's really
something really serious

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.837 align:middle line:90%
going on down here.

00:06:21.837 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want no
one to know about that.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Would you call
that today's fake news--

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:90%
this disinformation?

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is definitely
the fake news of the planet.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not just here.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:90%
It's all over.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look what happened
with The Disclosure Project.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And a few months later,
they take the towers down.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's a shift
of, whoa, we can't

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:84%
have the astronauts
on this world press,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:90%
the world's largest watch--

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.347 align:middle line:84%
press movement talking
about this stuff,

00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
because now we're going
to have to answer to this.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's get the timeline
up on this other project

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and get everyone shifted
into being Americans

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and saving the world
against terrorists.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's all this shifting of
your attention to something

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.387 align:middle line:90%
that's really, really important.

00:07:10.387 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:84%
The world's biggest
story is going on,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
but we don't want you to
know about that just yet.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's like the
sleight of hand, isn't it?

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.719 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you been used in
these kinds of disinformation

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:90%
programs?

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I've never been used.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.390 align:middle line:84%
My stories that I tell you
are exactly how I see them.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Exactly how I was involved
with these corporations

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:90%
and the government.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:84%
No one has ever approached me
to say this, that, or the other.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.975 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I am a solo renegade--

00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: But you've been--

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --person.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: --in these programs?

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Not the
disinformation programs.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:84%
I worked in programs where
they had disinformants

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.074 align:middle line:90%
there to make sure--

00:07:42.074 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And you knew that?

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.806 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I definitely knew that.

00:07:44.806 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
They even came forward on a
couple contracts and said,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:84%
you will have disinformed
information for security

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.767 align:middle line:90%
and intelligence reasons.

00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did
you feel about that?

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.225 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It was fine.

00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Because even though
I've operated

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:84%
on beings and maybe 3%
of them were definitely

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
not what they supposedly
were, the rest of the 97%

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:90%
is pretty amazing.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Was there somebody
specifically involved

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
with these people that they
planted for disinformation?

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.570 align:middle line:84%
One would call them
handlers, for example?

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Not that I'm aware of.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I never was assigned a
person to watch over me.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I have, right now,
scientific advisors,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and military advisors,
and instructors

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.760 align:middle line:84%
that I worked with a long time
ago that are still my friends.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And I just have the
utmost respect for them.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of say,
hey, Emery, maybe you

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.130 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't talk about this,
or that, or the other.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.549 align:middle line:84%
But they're all looking out
for my best interest and also

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:90%
my safety.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is disinformation
healthy and important?

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't see a positive
thing about this information,

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:84%
unless it has to do with
keeping the intelligence

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:84%
of some sort of item that
could be used against us.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that would be the
only beneficial thing.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Because it's better to be
truthful about-- to the public,

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
especially, about what's
really going on out there.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.774 align:middle line:84%
But if you're using it for your
own benefit and to dumb down

00:09:11.774 --> 00:09:14.190 align:middle line:84%
the public, then I think it's
like the most horrible thing

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:84%
you could do to a civilization,
by suppressing them and holding

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:90%
them up.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.823 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at Tesla
and Stubblefield

00:09:19.823 --> 00:09:24.120 align:middle line:84%
since 1899 and how they were
attacked and suppressed.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
By now, we should already
have our flying cars,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
anti-gravitic devices,
and our zero-point energy

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.040 align:middle line:90%
devices for everyone.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, it's almost
like we have companies

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
within the programs to develop
these kinds of disinformation

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.126 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it's about
money, and it's about ego,

00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:41.345 align:middle line:90%
and it's about control.

00:09:41.345 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:84%
They want to protect their
intellectual properties.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:84%
They want to protect
their secret devices,

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
whether it's aircraft, or a
healing device, or whatnot.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:90%
So these corporations are also--

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.700 align:middle line:84%
like you said, within them
they have disinformation just

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:84%
for the employees, just so
no one steps out of line.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's sad.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
these employees

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.999 align:middle line:84%
will get this
information, report it

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:07.290 align:middle line:84%
to the public, which they
didn't really want to happen.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know that
was going to happen.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And then it sets off a trigger.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:84%
This is like the
ticking time bomb.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And then that information
gets over to another country.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, people
are hiring people

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.937 align:middle line:84%
to kill people to get
this information--

00:10:20.937 --> 00:10:21.736 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Geez.

00:10:21.736 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --when the
information doesn't even exist

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:90%
or the device.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Take this
with all due respect,

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:84%
but how do we know you're
not a disinformation guy?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:90%
How do we know that?

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the only way
I can say is to look at me,

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.550 align:middle line:90%
check all my credentials.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only person that
came up here with credentials

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:90%
from the colonels and captains.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And I have my DD Form 214.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably one of
the only insiders that

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.958 align:middle line:84%
actually came
forward with hundreds

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.919 align:middle line:90%
of papers, which Gaia has--

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:90%
I've been checked out recently.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.419 align:middle line:84%
Michael Salla just did a
huge background check on me,

00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:52.543 align:middle line:90%
which I was really nervous.

00:10:52.543 --> 00:10:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And he's
very thorough.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: He was
very thorough on me.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:84%
He flew in from
Hawaii-- did this--

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:90%
he took me out to dinner.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:90%
I was really nervous.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.299 align:middle line:90%
And I brought all my paperwork.

00:11:01.299 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't even
prepared for that.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's taking pictures of
every certificate I have.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:90%
And he went beyond that.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And once he left, he actually
went to Stanford University

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and went to Harvard University--
contacted the physicians there

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.426 align:middle line:84%
that I had helped develop a lot
of my patents with and stuff.

00:11:17.426 --> 00:11:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And these people all
spoke very highly of me.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.860 align:middle line:84%
They said, yeah, this
is the real Emery Smith.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:90%
He did develop these devices--

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:84%
was part of all these
medical testings of curing

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:90%
these things and those things.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And then he was
also investigated

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
at Kirtland Air Force Base and
other military installations.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And all my commanders have
given me the highest regards.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And so he wrote a big
paper on that, which that

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:90%
helps the public understand.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Absolutely.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:90%
That makes them comfortable.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.893 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm going
to tell the public.

00:11:43.893 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
As I'm talking to
you, you really

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.621 align:middle line:84%
can't believe
anything anyone says.

00:11:47.621 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:84%
You can't believe
anything you read.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.578 align:middle line:84%
You can't believe
anything you see.

00:11:50.578 --> 00:11:53.114 align:middle line:84%
And I know this because I
know the satellites that

00:11:53.114 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:84%
can project something
right here with a shadow

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:90%
and reflect light.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And you will honest to
God think that's real,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.270 align:middle line:90%
because we use our senses.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:84%
You have in the past said that
there was information that you

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:90%
were authorized to disclose.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.817 align:middle line:90%
Who gave you that permission?

00:12:08.817 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, I'm still--

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:10.983 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Can you tell us?

00:12:10.983 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was under NDAs with
corporations, not the military.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:84%
The military-- I just knew
what I could and could not

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.920 align:middle line:90%
say for an amount of time.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:90%
So no one actually called.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I just waited a good 20
years for this to go by.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And I know what I
can and cannot say.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And in time, there's going to
be more and more information.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm still here talking
to you guys every week,

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.742 align:middle line:84%
trying to get this
information out,

00:12:35.742 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
trying to educate the
public that there's

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:84%
a lot going on that can help the
world and clean up the planet.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's my main goal.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here for anything
else, but actually

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:84%
to clean up the planet, and
try to get the beat on all

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
these diseases around the
world, and stop the hunger,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:90%
and stop all the killing.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.294 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not
going to get anywhere.

00:12:55.294 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And the planet's getting
really upset with us.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So my main goal is not
about telling the world,

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.510 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, there's these
secret bases and ETs exist.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's true.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.085 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone
already knows that.

00:13:07.085 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's out there.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But that has to do
with the technologies they

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:84%
are suppressing that we
need to help each other

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:90%
and help the world.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.929 align:middle line:84%
Because if we had all
these technologies,

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:18.428 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't need
gas, coal, and oil.

00:13:18.428 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be
fighting each other.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:84%
We'd be more as a
conscious collective trying

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
to help the planet
and help each other.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I'm trying to
shift this, just in education

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:29.980 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But who authorized
you to disclose this?

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There is no
authorization for me.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.056 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: No
individual from above?

00:13:36.056 --> 00:13:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No individual
ever came to me.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I just knew what I could and
could not say since day one

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and I'm doing it.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:84%
There was never a phone call
from a corporation that says,

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, you can do this.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:84%
I never had a call from my
ex-commander saying da, da, da,

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:90%
da, da.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But what if
you said the wrong thing?

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.514 align:middle line:90%
Who would come down on you?

00:13:53.514 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I would not know.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But you guys would know,
because I'd be dead.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It could
be that serious?

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, absolutely.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.154 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If you
said the wrong thing?

00:14:02.154 --> 00:14:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, if I
said the wrong thing

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and maybe slipped
up a couple times,

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:06.985 align:middle line:90%
I'll get a slap on the hand.

00:14:06.985 --> 00:14:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And who's slapping
me on the hand?

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, they might take
a family member's life,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:84%
my best friend's life, maybe my
dog, just as a little message.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:90%
So these threats are real.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.214 align:middle line:84%
And I was working
on some things.

00:14:21.214 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I was
saying some things

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't have been,
not on TV, by the way.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Just on the phone
with other colleagues.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And they sure did
come down on me.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you know
who they might be?

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's definitely a
clandestine, major corporation

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:84%
that has intellectual
property I might be affecting.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It sounds like
you know who they are

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:84%
and for obvious reasons,
you can't disclose.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're a
very large entity,

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.300 align:middle line:84%
and it's made up of major
corporations all over.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know specifically
who they are.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:84%
But I just know that
they're out there

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.830 align:middle line:90%
because I have been warned.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.942 align:middle line:84%
I have had text messages
and phone calls.

00:14:53.942 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They mean business.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And things were--

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.146 align:middle line:90%
they're calling me up.

00:14:57.146 --> 00:15:00.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one time they drove
by my house in a white van.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
The two guys in tactical outfits
got out, waved their MP5s at me

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:90%
and just pointed at me.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.054 align:middle line:84%
And then I knew I might
have did something,

00:15:08.054 --> 00:15:09.970 align:middle line:84%
or said something to
someone I shouldn't have.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Were they wearing
masks or anything like that?

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yes.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:12.265 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:12.265 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, they were?

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.224 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Just
wanted you to know

00:15:15.224 --> 00:15:18.199 align:middle line:84%
that if you stepped
outside of the boundaries,

00:15:18.199 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:90%
they know where you live.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, they do.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.394 align:middle line:84%
There's no hiding
from any of these.

00:15:23.394 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:84%
You cannot hide
from these things.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.101 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, on previous
"Cosmic Disclosure" shows,

00:15:27.101 --> 00:15:31.090 align:middle line:84%
you've talked a lot about ETs
and what's happening there.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Are they trying to
give us disinformation

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.400 align:middle line:84%
about the
extraterrestrial presence?

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Are they trying to hide that?

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're not trying
to give disinformation so much

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:84%
as not giving the information
of their existence.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:84%
All the countries have released
all their documents for UFOs,

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:90%
but no one talks about it.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.603 align:middle line:84%
Only in the United
States of America--

00:15:50.603 --> 00:15:53.440 align:middle line:84%
have not yet
released everything.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.534 align:middle line:90%
I wonder why.

00:15:54.534 --> 00:15:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Because there's too
many good things to release,

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, that's
why we need everyone

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.940 align:middle line:84%
to go out and find
out for themselves.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Don't believe in
what I'm saying.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to convince
anybody of all the stuff I've

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:90%
been through.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to expose
a couple of things,

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:84%
so we can work together
in a scientific community,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.400 align:middle line:84%
to develop these things
without the government

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and get it out to the world
to help heal the world.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What about
false flag programs tied

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:90%
into ETs and things like that?

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Have they set us up with
different kinds of false flags?

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I
think by looking

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
online at a lot of
certain other countries.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be our
country writing a paper--

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:84%
writing a letter
in Bolivia saying--

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
or showing a video of an
extraterrestrial tied up

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:90%
and being interviewed.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.190 align:middle line:84%
These are disinformation
campaigns.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.710 align:middle line:84%
They would not really
allow that to happen.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Or it would be taken off
within the first hour

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:90%
of it being downloaded.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they're
great campaigns.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:84%
They are successful
doing what they're doing.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's exciting news
to see something like that.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:90%
It's intriguing.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And it affects the
general population

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:90%
into what they believe in.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:84%
The best way to do it
is in broad daylight

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
by just making a
movie and giving you

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.109 align:middle line:84%
that idea these things
got 10 tentacles.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to come lay
an egg in your sinus cavity.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.589 align:middle line:84%
So that's been going
on since day one,

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
easiest, best way.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:84%
It's right in front of
you-- the disinformation.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:84%
All the stuff that they're
doing to try to control us

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.220 align:middle line:90%
is right in front of you.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And they do it
through the media.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:90%
They do it through movies.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:90%
They do it through TV shows.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:84%
But the good thing is a
lot of people know that.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people--

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:84%
it actually opens you
up a little bit more,

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:84%
too, in accepting different
races and different people

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
from around the universe if
something were to come out.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:84%
But the bad thing
is to say that this

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a very
evil agenda they know.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How does the
public know the difference

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:84%
between the real thing
and the false thing,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:84%
where it looks authentic
or maybe it's not?

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.255 align:middle line:90%
How do we know this?

00:18:07.255 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That is the most
difficult thing to decipher.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Usually when a really
authentic video comes out

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
catch it in time,

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:84%
it'll be chased by a
bunch of other fake videos

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
that they'll disinform
the public about

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:84%
or showing a similarity
to this specific video.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
throws everyone off.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Because then you're saying,
oh, well, these five

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:90%
are already proven fake.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.700 align:middle line:90%
So this one must be fake.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:90%
It's so similar.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But it's the
real one, probably.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it's the
real thing going on.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And this happens a lot
all around the world,

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
usually in other
countries, because they

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.490 align:middle line:84%
can get it uploaded faster
than we can here in the US

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:90%
without it being taken off.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What has technology
done to disinformation?

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Because now, you can
do incredible things

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:84%
with video editing,
with audio editing,

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:90%
with computer graphics.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:84%
You can do all kinds of
things to distort people.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:84%
How can you trust
any video where

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I could take a picture
with a friend of mine

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.780 align:middle line:90%
and make it look like you?

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Or have a video
shot where it looks

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.255 align:middle line:84%
like you and I were
having dinner somewhere

00:19:22.255 --> 00:19:25.075 align:middle line:84%
and talking and
verbalizing secrets--

00:19:25.075 --> 00:19:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And even putting
words into our mouth.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's gone to a whole
linear effect of negativity,

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
trust anything anymore.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard to do that.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And the best thing
is getting people

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:84%
behind it-- witnesses
that can come public

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and say, yes, this
is what happened.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I took this video.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Here's all the people around me.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:84%
For instance, on one
of my CE-5s there

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.110 align:middle line:84%
was a light being in front
of me-- a very small being.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the most world-famous
civilian pictures that I took.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, there
was people there.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So when I took everyone's
name down, just

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:84%
to make sure we have the proper
authorization to show something

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:84%
like this and say, hey, it's
not me shooting a video,

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:84%
or a picture saying,
oh, well, I saw it.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Exactly.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I wasn't
the only one who saw it.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.483 align:middle line:90%
There was other witnesses.

00:20:19.483 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So when these massive
events happen around

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.220 align:middle line:84%
the planet in Mexico
City, over Washington, DC,

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and it gets filmed, and there's
a mass group of individuals

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
looking at this, I think that
really helps tell the public,

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, even if 90% of
all these or 95% or 99%

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
of all these videos on YouTube
are fakes, even if 1% is real,

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.235 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty amazing stuff.

00:20:46.235 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
public really needs

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.220 align:middle line:84%
to decipher that on
their own, and doing

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.190 align:middle line:84%
their own investigations, and
looking at these technologies,

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle line:84%
because you can
fake anything now.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The late Roger
Leir was an expert in alien

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of implant
removal from people.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
He was convinced that
the implants were

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.690 align:middle line:84%
of some extraterrestrial
measures put in people

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:90%
for tracking and other reasons.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Have you looked at the
alien implant phenomenon?

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't get into
the alien implant phenomena.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I have removed a lot
of debris and things.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
metal in their body.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.785 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how they really got
there, which they do give off

00:21:29.785 --> 00:21:30.660 align:middle line:90%
energy and frequency.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.743 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you're saying
those could be natural?

00:21:32.743 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think they
are natural phenomena.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.490 align:middle line:84%
But I can't say that
I've done more than just

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%
over a few hundred
of these procedures.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But I've never
seen anything that

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:84%
would relate to it of someone
placing it now into the body,

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.545 align:middle line:84%
or another being, or it being
actually put into the body.

00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You don't think it
could be done by governments

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.424 align:middle line:90%
to track people or--

00:21:56.424 --> 00:21:57.256 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:21:57.256 --> 00:21:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: --do something?

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.254 align:middle line:90%
That's a possibility.

00:21:59.254 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That can
definitely be done.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:84%
They have a higher type of
technology for that, though.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Scars are different.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
If you see very odd scars on
the body that don't make sense,

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.267 align:middle line:90%
they've been inoculated.

00:22:14.267 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they're kind
of welt looking, right?

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Not that they have
a welt, but an actual scar,

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:84%
or a bruise or
something that doesn't

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:84%
look-- that's in a
specific shape, let's say.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.870 align:middle line:84%
These people have
been inoculated.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can get
inoculated just walking.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Amazing things.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do they have
to brush against you?

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They could
just brush against you.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't even know it.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Like a bump?

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.218 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: There's just a bump.

00:22:36.218 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And this has happened
to myself and my team

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:90%
just this past six months.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was contaminated
at the airport in Denver.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did you
get sick there?

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I didn't
get sick, but I

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:84%
did have to take very
serious precautionary methods

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:84%
through some special physicians
to help get this stuff out

00:22:59.170 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:90%
of my body.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.912 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did
they get it into you?

00:23:01.912 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They bumped into me.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.087 align:middle line:84%
Three guys in sweatshirts
bumped into me.

00:23:05.087 --> 00:23:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Three different bumps?

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, yeah,
three different bumps.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they got
me the first two times.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.459 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't think about it,
because it was really crowded.

00:23:12.459 --> 00:23:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: At the airport?

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't till a couple
of my close friends when I was

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:84%
in my T-shirt said, hey, what's
that weird circle with a dot

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:90%
in the middle--

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: On your
arm or something?

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --and with
10 dots around it?

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I have pictures of it.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:28.720 align:middle line:90%
And it showed this inoculation.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.840 align:middle line:90%
And I know what that was.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, they got me.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.143 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Did you feel it?

00:23:32.143 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, did not feel it.

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:90%
It happened so fast that--

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and it's done with such
a very small device.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
The imprint is about the
size of a dime with a--

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And what
would the intent

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.150 align:middle line:90%
be, Emery, of doing this to you?

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe it was just
for tracking, because I've

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.340 align:middle line:84%
been going a lot off
the grid lately and not

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.870 align:middle line:90%
carrying my phone with me.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:90%
And it gets them nervous.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they were
trying to kill me or anything,

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.966 align:middle line:90%
but the existence of these--

00:23:58.966 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:84%
these nanomites were
proven and detected.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go
through a little bit

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:84%
of a special detox-type
program that we have.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was all fixed
within about 48 hours.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They've
appeared at your doorstep.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
They've appeared at
airports threatening you.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Why do they continue to
let you say what you say?

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm not saying anything
that someone else actually

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.470 align:middle line:84%
may or may not have leaked out,
even though the public doesn't

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:90%
know about it.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.850 align:middle line:84%
They are not really
worried about me

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:35.560 align:middle line:84%
talking about extraterrestrials,
talking about my experience

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.810 align:middle line:90%
in underground facilities.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%
They are upset about me
moving forward, talking

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:46.720 align:middle line:84%
about future technologies before
it's the right time, which

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:90%
I can understand a little bit.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.778 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
these technologies

00:24:49.778 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
could be used not for the
betterment of mankind,

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.970 align:middle line:90%
so we have to be very safe.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:84%
But I still need to
educate people about that.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we have these answers, OK?

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to
be slow on releasing.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:84%
They don't want the
iPhone 20 out right now.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
They want it to slowly
release these cures

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and release these devices
and the information.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:84%
But since I've come
forward, there's

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
been 15, 20 different
devices that

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.980 align:middle line:84%
have come out since
November, because I just

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
slipped a little bit about
the information about it.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And the corporations
now are all over the IPs

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:90%
trying to get these things out.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So they're listening
to these shows.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're listening
to what I'm saying.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind
of sick of it, too,

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:84%
because they have
someone over them,

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.630 align:middle line:90%
making sure this doesn't happen.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But when someone like me
comes along and starts

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.381 align:middle line:84%
talking about it, well, then
they have to do something.

00:25:47.381 --> 00:25:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And they are either going
to have to make money off it

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.160 align:middle line:90%
or completely bury it.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And they rather make
some money off it

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and release-- say,
well, yeah, what

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.243 align:middle line:84%
he said about this-- there's
a little bit of truth

00:25:56.243 --> 00:25:57.760 align:middle line:90%
behind it with science.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:90%
So they're upset.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.570 align:middle line:84%
The attacks are coming at
me because, really, it's

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:84%
more about that than it
is with the ET stuff.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:84%
They don't care whether
people believe ETs exists

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.769 align:middle line:84%
or not, because there's no
money in talking about ETs.

00:26:13.769 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They're concerned
about planetary issues that

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:90%
affect their pocketbook.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What keeps pushing
you, Emery, to tell the public

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.060 align:middle line:90%
about disinformation?

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, what
drives me is the fact

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that I was involved
with technologies

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.600 align:middle line:90%
that needed to come out.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're suppressing
technologies

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.250 align:middle line:84%
with disinformation, saying
they can't make this technology.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Yet, oh, we can't do this yet.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:39.820 align:middle line:90%
That's impossible.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Smith-- what's he talking about?

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Zero energy devices.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're so far away
from that, but we're not.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.890 align:middle line:84%
We're so more
advanced than this.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And since I know
the truth, I want

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.560 align:middle line:84%
to expose that truth
for these technologies

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to get out and help
clean up the planet,

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and help cure the world
of disease and famine,

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and get clean, potable
water to the world.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.050 align:middle line:84%
People are just waiting to
have fresh water for God sakes.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's these things that drive
me to come here and sit next

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:90%
to you and educate the world.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not the
only scientist out there

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.920 align:middle line:90%
that can do this.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.890 align:middle line:84%
There's hundreds of thousands
of amazing, bright people that

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:84%
have come to me with the
most amazing inventions that

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.370 align:middle line:90%
just blow my mind.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:27.220 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, they're so--

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.465 align:middle line:84%
they're scared to come
forward, which I understand.

00:27:29.465 --> 00:27:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You've got
the guts to do it.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And I'll do it.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll speak for you.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I'll get up here.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming out here.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.454 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
represent you guys.

00:27:38.454 --> 00:27:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to do it
if you're not comfortable yet.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've recently-- just have
a few scientists come forward

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and some more insiders making
preparations for their families

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:51.220 align:middle line:84%
to come forward and
talk to you and I.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.220 align:middle line:90%
So it is affecting people--

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.516 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing here and
talking about it, because it

00:27:56.516 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:90%
puts it out into the ether.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And it makes these
scientists feel

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more comfortable.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still here.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.350 align:middle line:90%
So let's do this.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's do it together
and let's get it out.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.689 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I consider
you a patriot.

00:28:06.689 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, thank you.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I was at an
event a couple months ago

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:90%
and a couple came up to me.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And they said, what do
you think of Emery Smith?

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And I had already interviewed
you on "Beyond Belief" on Gaia.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I think
he's the real deal.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:84%
He's got more guts
than most humans,

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:84%
because he's putting
his neck on the line.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.920 align:middle line:84%
At any moment, that neck
could be chopped off.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.100 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing that
would stop you, is there?

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They've taken
everything from me, George.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I've been shot, stabbed,
tortured, kidnapped.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm not going anywhere.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:90%
They know it.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.360 align:middle line:90%
So I'm here.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to keep
going as long as I can.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to viewers that
you have and that Gaia has

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and other individuals
who stand by me.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.970 align:middle line:90%
It motivates me to keep going.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have nothing
to lose anymore.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't have anything.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm here to represent
those people that

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.440 align:middle line:84%
do have the fear,
because I have no fear.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.439 align:middle line:90%
And I am not stopping.

00:29:16.439 --> 00:29:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: As you know,
Emery, "Cosmic Disclosure"

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.220 align:middle line:84%

guest hosts and new insiders

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.070 align:middle line:84%

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:90%
important story.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.250 align:middle line:84%
As a regular to the show,
do you have more information

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.620 align:middle line:90%
to tell the world?

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I have a lot
to tell the world,

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:37.460 align:middle line:84%
so I'm glad to be here and be
able to express the things that

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.320 align:middle line:84%
have happened to me
and the things that

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.874 align:middle line:90%
are coming for the world.

00:29:40.874 --> 00:29:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Quite a
hero, my friend.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Quite a hero.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Thank you.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.200 align:middle line:84%

Gaia are committed

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.400 align:middle line:90%

out there that started around

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.970 align:middle line:90%
the same time we did.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:18.936 align:middle line:84%

a lot more advanced

00:30:18.936 --> 00:30:21.610 align:middle line:84%
than we are because they
didn't have this control

were blueprints for
