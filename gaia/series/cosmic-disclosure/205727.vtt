>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:10%
we are with retired SEAL Team-6
Chief Petty Officer Michael

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:10%
Jaco who has over 35 years of
extensive combat experience,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.930 align:middle line:10%
including 11 years as
a CIA Security Officer.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Michael, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL JACO: Great
to be back again, Emery.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.142 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael,
in the Space Force,

00:00:40.142 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:84%
you have experienced and
witnessed various crafts.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:84%
What could you
tell us about that?

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: The various craft or
all the way from individual

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.080 align:middle line:84%
controlled and piloted aircraft
to two, three, four-seaters,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and then as long and as big
as mile-long spaceships.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So these different craft are
obviously very high tech.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them had the
soul energy within them.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you actually
fly them, you're

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:84%
flying them with
your consciousness.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Now that the craft itself
as its own consciousness

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.330 align:middle line:90%
can fly itself.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, you just
tell it the destination,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and it heads out, and it
takes care of business.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Now this business could be
it's flying over a planet

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:84%
where you're trying
to cloak yourself.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.660 align:middle line:90%
So it will cloak itself.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.130 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to monitor that.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.450 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do that.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:84%
It has an intelligence
of its own.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:84%
You just tell it what
you want it to do.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Now when you're in combat, it'll
be handling different systems

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and making sure everything
is run properly.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
We've seen those
"Terminator" movies

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%
where the Terminator
gets shot by a bullet,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:90%
and it reforms itself.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:90%
So these craft are the same way.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:90%
They can reform themselves.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:90%
So they get damaged.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.007 align:middle line:84%
They have liquid
metal that will form.

00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it like
heals itself, the craft.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: It heals itself.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
There's nanotechnology,
the same kind of technology

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
that's actually in our
bodies to a certain extent.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually
heal ourselves,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:84%
but not we're not
liquid metal, of course.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But they will come in and
actually help us heal faster

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that too.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Are they organic?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: They are metallic
and organic as well.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:90%
You know, they're both.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:84%
These nanotechnologies have
a consciousness of their own.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're AI.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they will have,
actually, a consciousness that

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.060 align:middle line:84%
connects with your
consciousness.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like it has
its own little mini soul.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: You know, it's
a little mini you.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
It has a ability to connect
with you on a quantum level.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And that quantum connection,
that quantum thinking,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:84%
the quantum level
weaponry systems,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.650 align:middle line:84%
the quantum level aircraft--
and when I say "quantum,"

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:84%
it's a consciousness
level of information.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
It's consciousness level that
translates into everything,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
whether it's computerized
systems, whether it's

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:84%
a massive starship,
that's a mile long.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.060 align:middle line:84%
All of these different
systems are on a quantum

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:84%
high speed more
technologically advanced level.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why would
they need weapons?

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Weaponry-- they
don't always need them.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Some craft are just
reconnaissance craft

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
where you'll go out
and look at stuff.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And then other craft or
designed to actually go to war.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So you have many different
craft that you can actually

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:90%
choose for mission.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Just like I would, if I
was on a reconnaissance--

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael, when
did this take place?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Well, I started
on combat missions

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:90%
when I was in my teens.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:90%
They were very simple at first.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:84%
At first, I was just put into
aircraft and flown around.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually I
was put in aircraft,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and I would connect with them
and just do simple movements.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:84%
At first, it was
just a connection.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Someone else would like
get me to that point,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:84%
just like you'd take a
pilot lesson here in the US,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:90%
anywhere.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.040 align:middle line:84%
So you learn the
basics, and then you

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:90%
take it to the next level.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Now some of these craft
are extremely advanced.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And as I advanced in abilities,
as I advanced in age,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I was able to handle these
different level of craft.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
So craft at the level
where consciously

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
I integrate with the ship,
I integrate separately

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:90%
with the navigation.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I integrate separately
with the weapon system.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm integrated
telepathically

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of my team.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm also being influenced
or given information

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
from the starship, which
is basically sending

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:90%
out information, navigation.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And things change on
a dime, just like they

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:90%
do in a regular combat mission.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
As you're flying
in to do something,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
you might get sent to another
direction or another place.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's I'd like you jump
in this thing and you

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:84%
just, boom, you go, it's the
same thing any combat mission.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So as I progressed as an
operator, as a warrior,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.230 align:middle line:84%
here in the SEAL teams,
and then in the CIA,

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I became more adept at handling
more and more complex missions.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way it was
in the Secret Space Program.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where did
this take place?

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Some of these missions
were in our own solar system,

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:84%
on different planets
within our solar system,

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:84%
like in Jupiter, the
moons of Jupiter,

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Saturn, on the moons of Saturn.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I have memories of
actually having combat

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.860 align:middle line:90%
on these different planets.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And on Jupiter, in
particular, I remember

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:84%
going in and going against
what I call the "Rock Men."

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, they have like
rock face and rock bodies?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:90%
They're just like a reptilian.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the way I
looked at them, as a reptilian.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:84%
When we fought them, we
had to fight them as teams.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:84%
So they could resist our
pulse weapons, our pulse laser

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:90%
weapons.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Just like if you
had a shield, they

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:84%
could shield themselves
and resist it.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you came around somebody
that had a shield from the side

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.360 align:middle line:84%
or from behind, then
they were vulnerable.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.960 align:middle line:90%
So we worked on them in teams.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And this came over
a period of time

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.280 align:middle line:84%
where we would come against
these guys or these creatures.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, absolutely.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I've actually seen these
types of extraterrestrials

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:84%
that are from descendants
of the Arcturus sector.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting individuals
to say the least.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Fascinating.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But also
very resilient.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: So that was
some of your dissection

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that we went in and actually
worked on some of those.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
verification that I

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.928 align:middle line:84%
got something like that you
have experienced that as well.

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's unbelievable you
actually had combat with them.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Why were we in combat with them?

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: There's
different reasons.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:84%
The things we see
here that are illegal

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.200 align:middle line:84%
happen in space on
a very great level.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Human trafficking.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Weapons trafficking.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.428 align:middle line:84%
Although we're
getting to the point

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
where our technology is so
advanced, a lot of the ET races

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.125 align:middle line:84%
are actually buying
our technology

00:06:59.125 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
because we've advanced
so much with it,

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and we do such a
great job with it.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:90%
We're very resourceful.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.048 align:middle line:84%
We're very creative
with our information,

00:07:05.048 --> 00:07:05.848 align:middle line:90%
and they love that.

00:07:05.848 --> 00:07:08.223 align:middle line:84%
But there's still weapons
trafficking, human trafficking,

00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:90%
and weapons trafficking.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.240 align:middle line:84%
There is still that drug
trafficking that goes on.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is part of
what we're seeing here

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.927 align:middle line:84%
on a very dark
level, very nasty.

00:07:17.927 --> 00:07:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's a very dark level.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Yeah.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.085 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Indeed.

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Exactly.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Whose craft were these?

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: These craft
are basically ours.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:90%
We developed these craft.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:84%
We designed these
craft with ET help.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, it
came from the Nazis.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So the Nazis went to
Antarctica, developed the craft.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:84%
We thought we won the
war, but the Nazis

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:84%
had advanced their
technology in Antarctica kind

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:90%
of under the radar so to speak.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And once we realized that
they were pretty advanced down

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:84%
there, we sent a fleet down
there, the Admiral Bird fleet.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.493 align:middle line:84%
They came out with a directed
energy weapons and basically--

00:07:52.493 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That was a big war.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.785 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: That was a big war.

00:07:54.785 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And they, like,
ripped ships apart

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:84%
with their directed
energy weapons.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.840 align:middle line:90%
And we couldn't defeat them.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So from that point on,
we had to give people.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I was part of that early
program where I was supposed

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:90%
to be part of their group.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.910 align:middle line:84%
There was a process where
we were like bedded down.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: I remember there were
like hundreds of kids that

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:90%
were involved in my program.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And eventually at the end, there
were like a couple of dozen

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:84%
of us left when I went to the
moon for my first training.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Has any of these craft
leaked out through the media

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:90%
that you're aware of?

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.638 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Oh, absolutely,
we're seeing it all the time.

00:08:30.638 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
disclosure as well.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:33.620 align:middle line:90%
So these craft or our craft.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:90%
95% of them are our craft.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:90%
We design them.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:84%
We develop them, reverse
engineered more often than not,

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.530 align:middle line:90%
but also ET help.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So the ET help comes in and
helps us design these things.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:84%
There's crashes that
we've had way back

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.478 align:middle line:90%
where we reverse engineered.

00:08:51.478 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the technologies
that the military

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:84%
had in the early
days, night vision,

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, that's
all back engineered

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.880 align:middle line:84%
stuff that we got
off these craft.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Now as we go forward, we're
manufacturing more and more

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:84%
of these technologies ourself,
engineering moving forward.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:84%
These engineering
rates of progression

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.400 align:middle line:90%
are absolutely phenomenal.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:90%
I saw that at SEAL Team-6.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
I saw advanced
technologies at SEAL Team-6

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:90%
that were constantly coming in.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.115 align:middle line:84%
And I stepped away
from that program

00:09:19.115 --> 00:09:21.620 align:middle line:84%
at SEAL Team-6 for a few
years and then came back

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and did some more
interoperational training.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And they had advanced so
far in those few years,

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:84%
it was like I had
already was working

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
at a 50-year level of technology
above the regular SEAL teams,

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and now I felt like
just after a few years,

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.780 align:middle line:90%
it was at the 100-year level.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So the technological advance
in weaponry, in craft

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:90%
is unbelievable.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.845 align:middle line:84%
Stuff we can't talk
about, but it's fantastic.

00:09:48.845 --> 00:09:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was your
role in these craft?

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Sometimes
it's just a rider

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes actually
flying these craft.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
As we advance, as I advanced,
and became more senior,

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I started to actually
fly these craft.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And that translated into, later
in the game, training others.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Now flying the craft
themselves was fantastic.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.153 align:middle line:84%
It was something that
everyone should experience

00:10:14.153 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:84%
at some point in their life,
because the interaction

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:84%
that you have with the soul
level energy, and the vibration

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:84%
of that technology, the
vibration of that soul level

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
being that's flying that
craft is just unbelievable.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely remarkable.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In your regression
session with Barbara Lamb,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
you have mentioned positive
and negative influences

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: The two sides
that are opposed

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
are the galactic, the positive
Galactic Federation, and those

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:84%
of darkness, usually of
the Draco Reptoids race.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have positive
ETs that are trying

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:90%
to keep the timeline perfect.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Like the Pleiadians
are very involved

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:84%
in removing a lot
of the Draco races

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:16.350 align:middle line:84%
from Arcturus,
Andromeda, Sirius,

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:84%
many, many different
races of beings,

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
star beings that are here that
are contributing and helping

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:90%
in service to all.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
humans that are involved

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.500 align:middle line:90%
with those positive ET races.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the negative ET races

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:84%
which are trying
to enslave humanity

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the galaxy.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
that the Galactic Federation

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and the space forces
involved in stopping

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:90%
some of that trafficking.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you encounter
extraterrestrial intelligences?

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
context of that?

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Many different contexts.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
I would say I've encountered
positive and negative.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:90%
They're out there.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Just like you and I are having
this great conversation right

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:84%
now, we get along
real great, we know

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:84%
there's humans that we
could not sit together with,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and that they would like
cut our throat before we

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:90%
could think twice about it.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
There are ET races that are
like that, very violent, many

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:90%
of the Draco reptilian races.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Those races are extremely
violent, but not all of them.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
There's 50%, or
actually probably

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:84%
like 60% at this point, that are
trying to turn their brothers

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and sisters to become more
enlightened and positive.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think that process is
part of what we're involved in.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Now if we show up, like
we used to show up,

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
against a Rock Man and some
of these reptilian races,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.450 align:middle line:90%
they're extremely large.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:54.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're kind of small
in the extraterrestrial range.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:84%
You are looking at eight and
above and all the way up to 12,

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:90%
15 feet tall.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
The reptilians
are very powerful.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And their thought
energy is very powerful.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the things that
we learned early on as well,

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to reflect negative
energies that come at us.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
a lot of these alien races

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:90%
do that are negative.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:84%
They come in and dominate
our consciousness,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and can turn us, and flip us,
and make us do crazy stuff.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:84%
They can make us turn on
our brothers and sisters.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.605 align:middle line:90%
They have that ability.

00:13:28.605 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
things that we learned early

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:84%
on, especially in the special
projects that I was involved

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.520 align:middle line:90%
in, the special forces groups.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:84%
We all had to have that very
high level of intelligence

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and ability to
control our minds,

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.800 align:middle line:84%
which we learned from
a very early age.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.127 align:middle line:90%
So the ET races--

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:90%
I've been against spider beings.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The spider beings
are the baddest.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:90%
They're not fun to fight at all.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.360 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very big, very,
very powerful, very hard

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:90%
to defeat.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:90%
The memories are pretty strong.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.650 align:middle line:90%
They're emotional.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn how to
deal with your emotions.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.025 align:middle line:84%
You have to-- and I won't
say control your emotions,

00:14:08.025 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:84%
because controlling
your emotions

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:84%
can be a negative because you
just impact, impact, impact,

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:90%
and then they explode.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So you have to learn how to let
these emotions like just drift

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:90%
through you.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:84%
You notice a certain thing,
you become the observer

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.440 align:middle line:84%
instead of constantly
having these ups and downs

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:90%
with the emotions and so forth.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:84%
The ET races are loving,
many, many loving ET races.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:84%
The Venusians
trained us in love.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And that training you know
spilled into all aspects

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.410 align:middle line:90%
from that point on.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So we would always come in with
that consciousness of love.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
ET races, which

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle line:84%
were very large, very
powerful, and very dominant

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.860 align:middle line:90%
normally would soften.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:90%
And then they'd work with us.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.650 align:middle line:90%
It was that easy.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Now some of them,
we would come in,

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and unless we came
in very dominant,

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we had
increased in size--

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Hulk
program for a while.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I was increased in
size to the point where

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.150 align:middle line:84%
I was at least 8 feet tall
and almost 350 pounds, just

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:90%
like a Hulk.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:15.068 align:middle line:84%
And as that being coming
in-- and still kind

00:15:15.068 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
of on the small side of
some of these Reptilians,

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.817 align:middle line:84%
but when we came a very
powerful, very dominant, very

00:15:19.817 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:84%
like you're not going
to mess with us.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.800 align:middle line:84%
We're coming at you
lovingly, but if we need to,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:90%
we can throw down.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you come
at them like that,

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
then they're more
willing to deal with you.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:84%
95% of the time,
they'll deal with you

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
because they look
for weakness, they

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
look for someone
that is in fear.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:90%
They dominate someone with fear.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.865 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
learn how to overcome,

00:15:39.865 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
over all of our fears, and then
come into these different races

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.990 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
Arachnoid, whether they're

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Rock Men, whether they're
Reptilians, whether they're

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.840 align:middle line:84%
all the different species
that we would encounter over

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:90%
the years, it was just amazing.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
We'd always come in like
that, and most of the time

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:90%
we were able to deal with them.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you
touch base on sometimes

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
when you are out in the field
with these extraterrestrials,

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:84%
there are no
weapons because they

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
are the weapon with the
energy to shut your mind down,

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:90%
turn against your partner?

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Very good, yeah.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's absolutely correct.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these races
don't have weaponry.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people think, well,
if they don't have weaponry,

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:90%
then we can dominate them.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And no it doesn't work that way.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you come in with
that domineering attitude,

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that is what they
use against you.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:90%
And they turn you.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:84%
They flip you, can control
you, with that domineering type

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:90%
of attitude.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.305 align:middle line:84%
So loving, like we
talked about, you've

00:16:38.305 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:84%
got to come in with that
loving, vibrational attitude.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't, then
they're going to flip you,

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
control you, and all
kinds of different things.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
the Arachnoids are.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:84%
The Arachnoids are
extremely effective at that.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have to come in with
that loving vibration knowing

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
have to fight them.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very, very fine
line where a lot of people

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
think that you come in
domineering, you come in angry,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.940 align:middle line:90%
and that will get you killed.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Instantly.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: And in fact, I've
noticed that as a SEAL

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and as a CIA contractor,
some of those guys

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.492 align:middle line:84%
that were extremely violent
and wanted to throw down,

00:17:17.492 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:90%
they're the first ones to go.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:90%
They die.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want anyone
like that around us now.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way it
is in Space Force.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:84%
We are all trained to the level
of that loving consciousness.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually more effective
with that loving consciousness

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:90%
of vibration going in.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And with that loving
consciousness vibration,

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
we're actually able to
have layered thinking.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
We can handle our different
systems and so forth.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.735 align:middle line:84%
With that very strong, hard,
violent type of attitude,

00:17:46.735 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:84%
you can't handle some
of your weapons systems

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:53.015 align:middle line:84%
or communicate telepathically
with other people.

00:17:53.015 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:90%
You have to be there.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:54.862 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:17:54.862 --> 00:17:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You spoke
of the Venusians

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.300 align:middle line:90%
and how they taught you love.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:84%
How do you teach
someone an emotion?

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.775 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: So Venusians
are extremely

00:18:02.775 --> 00:18:04.150 align:middle line:84%
powerful with the
love vibration.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many different
ET races come and train

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:84%
with the Venusians in the
love energy vibration.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:90%
So it's a vibration.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think, Oh,
I have love for my dog.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:90%
I have love for my girlfriend.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:84%
It's actually much,
much deeper than that.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a love for all
conscious fields of energy.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you go into that, when
you look at someone in the eye,

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:90%
they can feel your love.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:84%
You go to the soul
level and you actually

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:90%
communicate soul level love.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
That's how the Venusians teach
with that love consciousness,

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
with that connection
with the soul level,

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
with looking into
someone's eyes,

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:84%
or looking into another
ET presence's eyes.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't
have eyes, then

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.332 align:middle line:84%
you imagine you're looking
into their soul level,

00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
whether that's in their head,
whether that's in their heart

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:84%
level, a lot of the ET races
have different areas where they

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:90%
have a love energy focused.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.782 align:middle line:84%
So just that's one of the
sensing things that you learn,

00:19:04.782 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
too, the vibrational energies
of different extraterrestrial

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:90%
races.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.770 align:middle line:84%
They're in all kinds of
configurations out there.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So you're, first of all,
you're coming at them

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.870 align:middle line:90%
with that love vibration.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.657 align:middle line:84%
You're not looking at them
going, oh my god, you're ugly.

00:19:19.657 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:90%
You know that would like--

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: No, you
wouldn't see that.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: You'd be done,
you're done, you know?

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:90%
They don't deal with you.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So you come at them
with that loving energy.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:90%
You're just open.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.015 align:middle line:84%
You're open to--
and you'll find out

00:19:30.015 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:84%
that some of the ones that
you would be grossed out

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and like freaked out
about maybe right now,

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
those are some of
the most loving,

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and amazingly, and have gifted,
can teach you a lot of things.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:42.760 align:middle line:90%
And they're willing to teach.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.690 align:middle line:90%
They want to teach.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:84%
They want to bring others up
to a higher vibration where

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:90%
they're at.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we encounter
with the Venusians.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So the Venusians, it was a
six-month training period where

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:90%
we learned how to have no fear.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning
of our training.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And although we had learned
this no fear in our training,

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:84%
up to that point, there
were still some factors

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:90%
that we needed to work through.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So heart-centered, we
think of the heart.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:84%
We think of the energies
of the heart going out,

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.395 align:middle line:90%
which are extremely powerful.

00:20:13.395 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:84%
The vibrational fields are much
larger than the actual brain's

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:90%
energies and so forth.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So we learn all of these
different vibrational fields,

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.420 align:middle line:84%
how to take those
vibrational fields

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and project them, how to get a
connection with other beings.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And that was part
of the process.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.582 align:middle line:84%
It was a long process
getting rid of the fears

00:20:33.582 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:90%
so there were no fears.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And if fear came in, if anything
that would normally excite you,

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:90%
learn how to overcome that.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was a process
learning the brain neurons, how

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:84%
they fire, and
neurolinguistics and so forth,

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:47.890 align:middle line:90%
how we use we use words.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And all these different
things, the Venusians

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:84%
taught us, most of
it through telepathy.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
We very rarely talk
with the Venusians.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:90%
They were mostly telepathic.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other
beings stood out for you?

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: The Mantis beings.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So the Mantis beings
are very tall.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I remember being in
between a couple of them

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:90%
that were my best friends.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And still to this day, I
consider the Mantis beings

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.080 align:middle line:84%
some of the most amazing
and beautiful beings

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:90%
that are out there.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.680 align:middle line:84%
But when you start
to connect with them

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:84%
on a telepathic and
then, like we talk about,

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
the heart-based level, it
will bring you to tears.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just so amazing
how much love

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.550 align:middle line:90%
and sharing that they have.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I've learned a lot
from the Mantis.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And I would tell
anyone to, if they ever

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:84%
see a Mantis being,
do not be afraid

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:90%
because they are amazing.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.660 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard of anyone
ever fighting a Mantis being.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I think they're all completely
integrated into the higher

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:90%
consciousness realms.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
insectoid that are like that.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
that are not so much,

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.405 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about
the Arachnoid, you know,

00:22:00.405 --> 00:22:01.205 align:middle line:90%
the spiders.

00:22:01.205 --> 00:22:04.730 align:middle line:84%
The spiders are
very, very tough.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.440 align:middle line:90%
They're tough warriors.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.850 align:middle line:90%
They get extremely big.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And they multiply on
an unbelievable level.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:84%
They'll come into a planet
and drop their eggs.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And within a few months, there
will be hundreds of thousands

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So we try to catch
them out very early on.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:90%
They're very aggressive.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:90%
They dominate.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:90%
They want to take over planets.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Once they come into a planet
and they lay that many eggs,

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:29.698 align:middle line:90%
then they think it's theirs.

00:22:29.698 --> 00:22:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And they'll fight all
the way to the death,

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:90%
every single one of them.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's very frustrating.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.460 align:middle line:84%
You'll knock a piece of
them off and they regenerate

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:90%
almost instantaneously.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:44.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of techniques to take
them out, a lot of firepower.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: A lot of the
regenerative medicine

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
technologies that we
have reverse engineered

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.530 align:middle line:90%
came from that race.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:52.655 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: That's fascinating.

00:22:52.655 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because they
have that ability.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Very good.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's one of
the things that--

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I have memories of it's
one of the toughest races

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:84%
out there, more
than the Rock Men,

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:90%
more than the Draco Reptilians.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.230 align:middle line:84%
They're the toughest
race to go against.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And I know their
consciousness is really high.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why they have
chosen the negative path,

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
but it is part of the
consciousness of the universe.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.115 align:middle line:84%
We have lots of different
beings out there.

00:23:21.115 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
beauties of it.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
some detractions.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in
the Space Force

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.955 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to manage
that to a certain extent.

00:23:30.955 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where did you
encounter the Mantis beings?

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And where did you encounter
the Spider beings?

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: The Mantis
beings, I remember,

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.810 align:middle line:84%
just outside of Draco in
the Arcturians star system.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So the Arcturians are
extremely advanced

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:90%
in their consciousness.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:84%
They're here on
Earth at this time

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:84%
trying to help us
ascend in consciousness.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.873 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I remember
being with those beings.

00:23:54.873 --> 00:23:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Those are my memories.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're not
completely accurate.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I have memories of being
part of the Sirian.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:84%
The Sirian B star
group is where I

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.160 align:middle line:90%
believe my starseed came from.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:84%
I have memories of
being with dolphins.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.155 align:middle line:84%
And even here as a Navy SEAL,
I've been around dolphins--

00:24:14.155 --> 00:24:15.530 align:middle line:84%
dolphins are always
coming to me.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:16.520 align:middle line:90%
I have this connection.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
I have this water
planet connection.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So Sirian beings, I
mean very advanced here.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm in
that energy helping

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:84%
people ascend in consciousness
with work that I do.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:90%
So it's very amazing.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So the Mantis are
very plentiful.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say as plentiful
as other insectoids,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
but they're very plentiful
throughout the galaxy.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.355 align:middle line:84%
And when we encounter
them, we know

00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:45.230 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to have
a good relationship.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're on our craft
oftentimes advising us.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And I just love
being around them.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When you
do encounter them,

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:90%
do you have a mutual agenda?

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: So my memories so far--
and I know there's lots more

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.820 align:middle line:90%
to come through--

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:84%
because when you
make a connection

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:84%
with a being like that, at
first you go through the motions

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and then you start
the analytical process

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:90%
of what is this.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So right now, very
emotional connection.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I know that they come in
to help us through trauma.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
They help us work into
abilities with the telepathy,

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:84%
working with other
races to calm them.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Because their abilities in the
calming higher consciousness

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.320 align:middle line:90%
realms are exceptional.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So as my memories start to come
back working with the Mantis,

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:38.160 align:middle line:84%
because I'm extremely
connected with them,

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's
going to inform me

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.822 align:middle line:90%
on a greater and greater level.

00:25:41.822 --> 00:25:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's look
at another clip

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:84%
talking about consciousness
and mind control.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: I worked with a
team of Grays at one time.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:90%
They also taught me telepathy.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.400 align:middle line:84%
They also taught me
other forms of connecting

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.060 align:middle line:84%
with this looking-glass
technology

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.483 align:middle line:84%
that I would
eventually work with.

00:26:03.483 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
They taught me how to
connect my consciousness

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:12.400 align:middle line:84%
with other consciousness
like plants, animals.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:18.400 align:middle line:84%
I would learn how to vibrate my
conscious fields to the point

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.720 align:middle line:84%
where I could have a conscious
connection with plants,

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.790 align:middle line:90%
with animals.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, I
would be able to connect

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.030 align:middle line:90%
with actual metal.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Then once I get to
that point, I started

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.150 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to connect with
the consciousness that's

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:84%
inside of spacecraft to
begin to talk with it,

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.410 align:middle line:84%
not fly it, or not move
it, but just to connect

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.282 align:middle line:90%
with it in the beginning.

00:26:46.282 --> 00:26:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When you see
yourself regressed,

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.730 align:middle line:90%
what do you think now?

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: After that regression,
a lot of information

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.090 align:middle line:90%
has come through.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of stuff that I
see in these regressions,

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.820 align:middle line:84%
it takes months sometimes
to decipher and understand

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.840 align:middle line:90%
this information.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's coming through
very quickly now.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So the consciousness
thing is one of the most--

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:11.630 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest thing that we
could understand in this space

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:12.495 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:27:12.495 --> 00:27:14.120 align:middle line:84%
The thing that we
have been trained in,

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.880 align:middle line:84%
the thing that has
advanced us to work

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
with other
extraterrestrial beings

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:84%
throughout the solar systems,
throughout the galaxy,

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and other galaxies--
we've actually

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
moved to other galaxies
and are working now.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're really
starting to advance

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:90%
on an unbelievable level.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So the minutia little things
that we look back, of course,

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:84%
to us down here
on Earth, it seems

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.710 align:middle line:84%
like very tragic,
very frustrating,

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.230 align:middle line:84%
but they are going to
be resolved very soon.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And once they're resolved and
this space program information

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.095 align:middle line:84%
comes through, people
are going to get involved

00:27:45.095 --> 00:27:46.220 align:middle line:90%
in it on a different level.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be very
exciting And very moving

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:49.710 align:middle line:90%
as we go forward.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness
is the thing that

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.280 align:middle line:84%
separates the space program from
those that are here right now.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.100 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
complete separation.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:84%
There's the Space Force,
which is on a different level.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:84%
We don't even really operate
here on Earth almost at all.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.177 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: And like
I said, you know,

00:28:07.177 --> 00:28:09.920 align:middle line:84%
when I had my training
as a little boy,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:84%
I never came to
the surface anymore

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
because the
consciousness would have

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:84%
brought my consciousness
down that's on Earth,

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:90%
which is very tragic.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It's an undesirable
situation and I

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.590 align:middle line:84%
think that's going
to be corrected soon.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.882 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael, what are
your comrades actually going

00:28:23.882 --> 00:28:25.812 align:middle line:84%
to think after
watching this episode?

00:28:25.812 --> 00:28:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Well some of them
are going to be like,

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:31.350 align:middle line:84%
ah, Mike, he's like off on
one of these trips again.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:84%
But some of them have tapped
into this stuff before.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:90%
We've had these discussions.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.970 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us talk
about this stuff.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Because we push
our consciousness

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.170 align:middle line:84%
in the SEAL teams,
it opens up all kinds

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:90%
of these different worlds to us.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.390 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
a lot of us have discussed.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I would even venture to say
that some of my comrades

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:51.800 align:middle line:84%
are even more advanced
in this information

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:84%
than I am, but just
aren't sharing it yet.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.150 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
beautiful things

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing
right now together.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.915 align:middle line:90%
You've done this work.

00:28:58.915 --> 00:29:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm getting
involved with it.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think more and more
people will get involved with it

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:03.350 align:middle line:90%
as we move forward.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.660 align:middle line:84%

you so much for being

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.735 align:middle line:84%
on the show and thanks
for this great connection.

>>JACO: Emery, it's been
an honor and a privilege.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm so amazed at what you
know, and I appreciate that.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Thank you, Michael.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:84%
