00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:21.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Today, on
"Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.060 align:middle line:10%
we're joined by Anjali, a former
Pentagon intelligence officer

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.400 align:middle line:10%
trained in information
operations and warfare.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:10%
Richard Doty also joins us,
a retired counterintelligence

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.619 align:middle line:10%
agent who served in
the Air Force Office

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.090 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:10%
Lastly, we have Tim,
a tactical advisor

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.160 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts trying
to understand the missions

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of non-human
intelligences on our planet.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Are the world governments
an open or a closed system?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my understanding is
that we're in an open system,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and what that means is
that Earth is susceptible

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.090 align:middle line:84%
to influence from outside
civilizations that can come

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:84%
in and affect our
decision making and affect

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:90%
our civilizations.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.140 align:middle line:90%
I think it's both.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
some people, groups,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:84%
companies that certainly
are prepared, or at least

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:84%
have knowledge about an
open-system scenario.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
groups and departments

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:84%
associated with governments
that do not even care and fully

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:84%
function under the presumption
of being in a closed system.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So when did this
first open system start?

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Was it with the treaties
back in the day?

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have a-- we had a
very influential person named

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:90%
John Lear.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he passed away, but
John had contacts with ETs.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:84%
He talks about
them all the time.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that John
reiterated over and over again

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
is the reason the ETs given
us advanced technology

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:84%
or given us the ability
to reverse engineer

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:84%
the ET technology was
preparing us for eventuality

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:90%
of what's going to happen.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.027 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if he
knew of the future event.

00:02:19.027 --> 00:02:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he ever
explained it to you,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:84%
but he never actually
explained to us,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:90%
when he told us about this.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But he said that the
ETs was assisting us

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
in advanced technology
for that event.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And some of the things John
Lear was talking about also was

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:84%
getting the downloads to build
special craft and special

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
protection for us on the
planet, if there were something

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.790 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think you
mentioned earlier

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that there were plans for
us to go amongst the stars.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Could you elaborate?

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, basically, the
situation that we had on this

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:84%
planet for quite some time
now is a prohibition of going

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:90%
off-planet.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
administration,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:90%
as well as from outside forces.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But when we're thinking of
this open-world scenario,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:84%
and we know that the government
already has made contact

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:84%
to certain other
planets, and they

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
know that there is
sustainable life out there.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:84%
There are already plans, indeed,
for sending certain humans

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
to other planets, where other
humanoid people are living.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Because they have societies
that are not that far away

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:84%
from the conditions that
we have on this planet.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Yet, they are like
hundreds or thousands

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
of years of having more
experience and a more

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.270 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated, civilized
way of living together.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:10%
And that is when the
travel embargo, which

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:10%
is the term for
it, gets removed,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:10%
and it's probably going to
happen again pretty covertly,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:10%
so it doesn't spread publicly.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But certain groups
in a larger number

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:90%
will get the opportunity.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:90%
>> So who are the plan-makers?

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Who gets to go off the planet?

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Who's making all
these decisions, Tim?

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, at this
moment, it's still plans.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're still dealing
with the situation

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:84%
that there is, indeed,
a travel embargo.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But once that get
gets removed, it's

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:84%
the standard
administrative process

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:84%
that's going to enable
people for recruitment

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and then sending out people to
different Earth-like planets.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that
has been found or discovered

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:84%
in the last probably 18 months
is a place called Johnston

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Island, in the Pacific.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:90%
It's west of Hawaii.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of activity
occurring on that island.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I know some people have
talked about the secret space

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
program, talks about
Johnston Island

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.910 align:middle line:84%
as having highly
sophisticated spacecrafts that

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:90%
can travel to the stars.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%
The director of Skunk Works
mentioned that some years ago,

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.090 align:middle line:84%
that we already can
go to the stars.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:30.655 align:middle line:90%
He said that.

00:05:30.655 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem is where are
they keeping these spacecrafts?

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, Johnston Island
isn't a big island.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:84%
It was used for
chemical storage,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:84%
chemical weapons storage, way
back in the '50s and '60s.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's been a lot of
activity over the last 15 or 20

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:90%
years in that island.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:84%
They built hangars, and they've
actually expanded the island.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that could be
one area where they're

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:84%
hiding the equipment
or the spacecrafts

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:84%
that we could use
in a deep space

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
program or the secret space
program to fly to these stars

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
or fly to these planets
that Tim is talking about,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:90%
the inhabited planets.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:84%
There's so many sophisticated
propulsion systems

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.090 align:middle line:84%
being studied, the
ion propulsion system.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I think some guy
listed 10 or 20 of them

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that would have the
ability to travel up

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:90%
to the speed of light.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you combine
what some of the ETs

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.410 align:middle line:84%
have given us as far as space
travel, theoretically speaking,

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
we have the ability
to do that now.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We have the ability, the
science to create a craft that

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:84%
can actually maybe find a
wormhole getting us from A to B

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:84%
in a faster or
quicker time period.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Wasn't it Ben from Skunk
Works who did say publicly,

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
we have the ability
to take ET home?

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And when he was
confronted with that,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:84%
he just said, it's
beyond my ability

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:90%
to talk about that at this time.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we're dealing
with both situations.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So we, on the one hand,
we have this planet

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that might want to send out
certain missions and groups

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:84%
in order to have kind
of an exchange program

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:90%
to explore things.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.340 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, there are indeed

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
observers and
consciousness and people

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:84%
that want to continue somewhere
else, in a different plane

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:90%
of reality of something.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're basically
dealing with both situations,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and indeed, there are even ETs
that their whole profession is

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.820 align:middle line:84%
collecting these souls and
distributing them to different

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:90%
other places in the universe.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Are governments regularly in
contact with extraterrestrials,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.580 align:middle line:90%
and if so, how do they meet?

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That's up to the ETs.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's be honest.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
They choose the
time and the place.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It can be whenever
they would like.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Have they ever told you the
governments that they speak

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.970 align:middle line:84%
to, they talk about
that, or countries,

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.760 align:middle line:84%
or is it just certain
select individuals,

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:90%
and how is that arranged?

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say, along the way, we
had certain species that were

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
very willing to show and present
themselves to certain groups

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:90%
within the government.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
they are an easy deal

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to get in contact
with, and there

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:84%
are established routines
and places in order

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.770 align:middle line:90%
to make contact.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'd even say that
there is a regular exchange

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:90%
in information.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I can go back to EBE 1.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
A lot's been released about
EBE 1, about what he's told us

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and how he facilitated
a communications link

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.650 align:middle line:90%
between Earth and his plane.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And using his communications
device and his energy device,

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle line:84%
we didn't know what
we were sending,

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't know what
was being received.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.550 align:middle line:84%
But if it wasn't for him, we
would have been in the dark

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:90%
the entire time.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:84%
But he even had
problems understanding

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.860 align:middle line:84%
some of the things that were
being sent from his planet,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and that's another
story in itself.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But I think that crudely
was a way that we were--

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
our first contact with an
extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:84%
not just him being here,
but his home planet.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And when he passed away,
we had the energy device

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:90%
and the communications device.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
The problem-- and we were
doing what he told us to do.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But we were getting
information back,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:90%
but we couldn't interpret it.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
probably the first.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:10%
And I've heard and
I've read and I've

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:10%
spoke to people who will
swear that Eisenhower had made

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:10%
contact with ET in California,
in a Mojave desert,

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:10%
out near Fort Irwin, in 1954.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's all over the internet.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people that went
to his library will confirm it.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
There's some missing logs
and so forth and so on.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was another
contact we might have had.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:84%
What we've had
since then, there's

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:84%
a lot of rumors about it,
about different relationships

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:90%
we had with other ET races.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We also need to keep in
mind that we are constantly

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:84%
receiving information from
outside, at all times.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Whether we can understand
and decode and decryptify

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
them or not, this is on
a different, other field,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:84%
but people are receiving
these radio messages.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Think of crop
circles, for example.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:84%
All these messages, and we've
done some analysis on them,

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and you can clearly see
this is communication

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:90%
in some way from somewhere.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.405 align:middle line:84%
So basically, there is
communication at all times,

00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:14.205 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:11:14.205 --> 00:11:16.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I like how you mentioned the
difficulty in translating what

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.230 align:middle line:90%
you're receiving.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Cause even as a
conscious contactee,

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I have a difficult time trying
to verbalize what is being--

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.440 align:middle line:84%
what I have received
in my download,

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.610 align:middle line:90%
what they're trying to say.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I
don't get it right.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.536 align:middle line:84%
I bet I don't get
it right a lot,

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:84%
a lot more than I probably
know, because humans

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:90%
are just fallible.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way it is.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's something that we
also have to keep in mind,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
that we are dealing
with a phenomena that

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
communicates in a different
way than these bodies.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.370 align:middle line:84%
These physical
bodies are programmed

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:90%
to communicate while we're here.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And now they're asking us
to look behind the veil

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and begin to
understand the greater

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:90%
reality of our existence.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's been
happening for quite some time,

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's difficult for
humanity to recognize that.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> There's also this
psychological pattern that

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:84%
humans can only interpret what
falls into the field of what is

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:84%
imaginable, what they
can imagine is possible.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you compare
that, for example,

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:84%
to the sound that
certain birds make,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
most scientists would say, this
does not qualify as a language.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Because why?

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:84%
They take the same,
those patterns,

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:84%
how we define language, and try
to put that onto what birds do.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.865 align:middle line:84%
But if you listen to
birds, even if you're--

00:13:05.865 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
you can clearly see they are
communicating in some way.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:11.523 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:11.523 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And probably in different
frequencies that we may not

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:90%
even-- may not be audible to us.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's unfortunate that the
humans sometimes will hear

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
the dolphin or the birds,
and that is a language.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.230 align:middle line:84%
It's communication,
but we shouldn't just

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.200 align:middle line:84%
judge that just because we
can't understand it yet.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Because in the future, we will.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.435 align:middle line:90%
>> And you know this.

00:13:36.435 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is not
a one-way street.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand that
ETs as well have differences

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:90%
with the way we communicate.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And we see that almost
ridiculously funny things

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
happened in the beginning,
when contact started,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.180 align:middle line:90%
that ETs made mistakes too.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And everyone on this planet
is shifting and upgrading

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:90%
its way to communicate.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I was at Area 51,
there was a manual description

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:84%
of ETs that have
visited Earth now,

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:90%
and this is in the early '80s.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And according to
this manual, there

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:84%
were five of them,
five different species.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
was detailed in this manual

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:84%
was that every single one
of these ETs were different.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.950 align:middle line:84%
They breathe
different atmospheres.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Some, the praying mantis
type, breathed methane,

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of methane.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Some had to have
oxygen depressors

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:84%
when they come to Earth,
because there's too much oxygen.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.030 align:middle line:84%
All of them were biologically
different from us.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Their brains were different.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Their body structures
were different.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one particular species
was able to feed itself,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:84%
as we described once in a
"Cosmic Disclosure" episode.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:84%
It didn't require
any outside food.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:90%
It produced its own meals.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.920 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
they had in common,

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
which really struck me when
I read this, was water.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.890 align:middle line:90%
They all required water.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Here we are, on planet Earth,
with a plethora of water.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:84%
They're coming from a
planet millions of light--

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
millions of miles away,
probably hundreds of thousands

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.290 align:middle line:84%
of light years away, and
they still require water.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Where might humanity be, if
there was no suppression of ET

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:90%
contact or technology and UFOs?

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think this is exactly
the way that it's supposed

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
If we had done it another way,
it would be a different place.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.490 align:middle line:84%
We all have a learning
path that we're on here,

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and this is part of
it, this development.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's think about
where would we be,

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:90%
if there was nothing like that.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, back in 1947, when
everything in Socorro, Roswell,

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:90%
it crashed.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:17.112 align:middle line:84%
And they just came forward,
and from there on out, we

00:16:17.112 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:84%
got to use this technology,
where would we be by now?

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>> If no secrets were ever
kept from the American--

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:84%
or the world, not just the
American people but the world,

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
wow, that's a great question
to where we would be today.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:84%
We would probably be the
most advanced civilization

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.270 align:middle line:84%
imaginable, because we
wouldn't have to hide anything

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:84%
that we obtain from
that craft that crashed

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.760 align:middle line:90%
at Corona, New Mexico, in 1947.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:49.770 align:middle line:84%
We could develop openly that
technology, everything that EBE

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:90%
1 told us we could utilize.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:10%
I know some of the things
that Colonel Corso wrote

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:05.640 align:middle line:10%
about we did get from ETs,
but between 1947 and on,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.690 align:middle line:10%
there were many, many, I can
think of 12 different crash

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:10%
sites that were visited.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
My very good friend, the
late Wendelle Stevens,

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
was one of the Commanders
of the recovery

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:20.310 align:middle line:84%
team, the DART team, the
Down Aircraft Recovery Team.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
He talks about technologies that
were so far advanced that it

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:84%
was, he said, it
was like us being

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.220 align:middle line:84%
ants looking at a
computer and trying

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:90%
to figure out how it worked.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:84%
But if things were open then,
and we were to share that,

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:84%
we would be the most advanced--
and we would probably

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.230 align:middle line:90%
be out visiting the stars now.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at just the energy
propulsion units alone that do

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:90%
not use gas, coal, oil.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's atmosphere,
imagine since 1947,

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:84%
we had over-- any free energy
that propel these craft.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Tim?

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if there's one thing
that's good about the way how

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
it actually went, then that
there were other people that

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:12.810 align:middle line:84%
already processed the trauma and
the fear and the anxiety that

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.090 align:middle line:84%
might come along with
such a big topic.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So basically, back in 1947,
and I totally understand

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.690 align:middle line:84%
that, those people
who were in charge

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.470 align:middle line:84%
of the security for
our country, they

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.380 align:middle line:84%
ran into something
unprecedentedly.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I assume that, even if they
got their things together,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.680 align:middle line:84%
they must have been full
of fear in some way,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:84%
because how do you
deal with that?

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:90%
What's their agenda?

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And now we're here, 70 something
years later or even more.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
We know a lot more about the
agendas of different species,

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
how to understand them, and
we can present something.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't
possible in 1947,

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:90%
when you're just in panic.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:84%
It seems that some
extraterrestrials target world

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:84%
leaders, while others
target individuals.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Are these contacts some of
the same beings, and if so,

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:90%
like what are their agendas?

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:19:22.612 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a deep one, I know.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.903 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a deep question.

00:19:24.903 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good one there.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>> What we've seen is that
species that are naturally used

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to certain social structures,
they prefer moving inside

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.950 align:middle line:90%
of these social structures.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a species that
has a strong leader principle,

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
they will tend to communicate
something to a leader.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:59.760 align:middle line:84%
If you have a species that
is very openly we're all

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:84%
the same, and it's more about
consciousness, awareness,

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
they will use a way
of communication

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that is more about
awareness and consciousness.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Have they ever said anything
to you about what determines

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:84%
what leader or what individual
they communicate with?

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.435 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:19.435 --> 00:20:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Anjali, what do you think
other individuals out there,

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:90%
why are they being contacted?

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.595 align:middle line:84%
>> I think for a
variety of reasons.

00:20:25.595 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're
all being contacted,

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.750 align:middle line:90%
and just who's aware.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Receptive.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Who's receptive?

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Who's aware?

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Who wants the contact?

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I think to a degree, we
all have conscious contact

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.233 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:20:43.233 --> 00:20:44.033 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's more of
an awareness thing.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they like to
have people in position.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.953 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't they?

00:20:52.953 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that a control
thing though?

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more of a job that
needs to be done and gathering

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:03.280 align:middle line:84%
information for
future knowledge,

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
to take knowledge in that
they don't always know.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There are times when
I'll ask them questions,

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say that
they don't know.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.913 align:middle line:84%
And I'll ask them to go
find, out and they do.

00:21:14.913 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And they'll come
back and tell me.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, beautiful.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a mechanism
that's happening that we really

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.600 align:middle line:84%
can't fully understand, and
they want us to know that.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But they want us to seek
for that understanding,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.310 align:middle line:90%
seek after it constantly.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, in an infinite universe
with countless species,

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:39.680 align:middle line:84%
where is like humanity in
the galactic power structure?

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that would be really
a philosophical question

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:90%
to answer, considering.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there's unlimited
species, let's say.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:90%
So where do we fit in that?

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.955 align:middle line:84%
How does humanity get into
this galactic power structure?

00:21:53.955 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we're low
on the food chain,

00:21:55.580 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
because our civilization,
our intelligent civilization,

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:84%
is only started some 2,000
years ago, intelligent.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So if these planets have
developed life prior to us,

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and we know some have probably
been around for 1,000, 10,000,

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:84%
100,000, maybe even a million
years more advanced than us,

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I would say we're
probably pretty

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
low on the intelligent species
chart within the galactic--

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of
room for improvement,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.307 align:middle line:84%
and I know Tim biting
at the tongue here.

00:22:36.307 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you've got
a great answer for this,

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:84%
because I see it as we're on
that trajectory to the top.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would answer that
question systematically.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.540 align:middle line:90%
What do we have?

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:84%
We have an ape race, an
ape race that typically

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.260 align:middle line:84%
has an alpha leader,
which makes it

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:90%
a pyramidal structured society.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:08.210 align:middle line:84%
It is a society that still has
a lot of unsolved problems,

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:90%
and it's a warrior species.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.730 align:middle line:84%
These are some deterrents
that you have to deal with,

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and that puts humanity
already somewhere

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:84%
in the universe,
where humanity has

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:90%
to deal with similar species.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So there are other species that
are, they don't have concept

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:84%
of invasion of war, of
competition, or something,

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:84%
but as they live in a
reality where this is not--

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:84%
no possibility anymore,
humanity is not part of it

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:84%
because humanity
is not there yet.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it puts
humanity in a similar way

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:84%
to species that are
similar structured,

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's what all
ET's attest and say

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:84%
is that humanity has one of the
highest evolutionary potential.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Surface humans on Earth
have one of the highest

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.220 align:middle line:84%
evolutionary potential
there is in the galaxy.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Which means they can
develop, and they

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:84%
can be a species
that still remains

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:84%
a warrior-type species
but becomes so integrated

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and has such a high moral or
ethical standpoint that they

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:84%
become kind of some
holy knight figure

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.380 align:middle line:84%
for other species that
do not want to care

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:40.850 align:middle line:84%
but are relying on the help
of people from this planet.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Anjali, what do
you think about this?

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Because you think
we'll be able to get

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:84%
to a non-war,
peaceful civilization

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:55.070 align:middle line:84%
to be part of this
galactic power structure?

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not sure.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.170 align:middle line:84%
We've been through
many, many cycles here.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:03.795 --> 00:25:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> They say that there
are many civilizations,

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.930 align:middle line:90%
where we have human body--

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:84%
or human civilizations
that exist.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And that these bodies are
used for the same thing

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:84%
everywhere they go,
that they're used

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.930 align:middle line:90%
for consciousness development.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.680 align:middle line:84%
That they're the--
like a perfect vessel

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
for sensory experience
learning, and that we

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:42.740 align:middle line:84%
don't have an evolved
human form that's thousands

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years old.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have
that, but they say

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.930 align:middle line:90%
that that's not what we're for.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:55.070 align:middle line:84%
That these vessels are not
who we are, and that we're

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:84%
just taking a ride in them
to have this experience.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, some people believe
that our soul is also living

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:06.590 align:middle line:84%
in multi-dimensional
places, on other planets,

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:90%
as extraterrestrials.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:84%
As a parting question, what
do you think about that?

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I have never experienced
me somewhere else,

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:90%
like on another planet.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I have had experiences where
I feel like I have somehow

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.960 align:middle line:84%
moved into like an
alternate timeline,

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:84%
where there will be just subtle
changes that have occurred.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have any kind
of explanation for that.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people have experienced

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:84%
those sort of things,
like even the death

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.810 align:middle line:84%
of a well-known public
figure, and then

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:49.820 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, a couple
of years later,

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:84%
