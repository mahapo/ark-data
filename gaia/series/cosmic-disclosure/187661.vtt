00:00:19.297 --> 00:00:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:84%
we have Sergeant Clifford
Stone, ex-military person who

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:84%
has been involved with
extraterrestrials.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Stone, welcome
to the show today.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD STONE: Thank
you, sir, once again,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:84%
it's my great
pleasure to be here.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In your
experience, have you ever

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to the inside
of an extraterrestrial craft?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: There were times that
I had to go inside the craft

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What was that like?

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: It was scary.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:90%
You never knew what to expect.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:84%
No two events were
exactly identical.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And you never knew
what to look for.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.572 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to go in
and from time to time

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:84%
the guy I always called
the Colonel would

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.780 align:middle line:90%
have me doing things.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't a mechanic.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.628 align:middle line:84%
I had no technical
knowledge of anything.

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I want
to make clear from the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:84%
get go, in each instance,
every craft we went into--

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
on Sci-Fi movies, it looks
like they hadn't been

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:90%
doing their house cleaning.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
They were like clinically
clean, like you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:90%
were in a surgical room.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have cobwebs,
things of this sort.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
But the situation is,
is that you go in there,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and you've just entered
another reality.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here it is, we
have a craft 30-35 foot

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:90%
diameter on the outside.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:84%
This would have been
in 1986 I believe.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.010 align:middle line:84%
We went in and there were
several instances like this.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:84%
But it never ceases
to amaze you.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.967 align:middle line:84%
30-35 foot diameter
on the outside.

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And you're awed when you go in
there, because you're thinking,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:90%
OK, something's not right here.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Because it looks much
bigger on the inside.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:90%
But how can that be?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It's only 30-35 foot
diameter on the outside?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't be any
bigger than that.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And it definitely couldn't be
bigger than that on the inside.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.565 align:middle line:84%
But when you go in,
I can explain it now.

00:02:23.565 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard for
people to understand.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
It was hard for me to understand
when I first heard about it.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:84%
But then you'd go ahead and look
up because this only may be,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:90%
what?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:84%
12 feet high,
things of this sort.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Yet here it is.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
This was maybe, I don't know,
40-50 foot tall on the inside.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering,
how can this be?

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So we would go ahead
and measure that.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing,
you saw no lights.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But it was perfectly
bright on the inside.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Not overlit, not underlit.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:90%
You had no problem seeing.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.490 align:middle line:90%
But then, here it is.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Remember, we're working on it.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I have to stress this,
30, 35 foot in diameter.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84%
But then you have like ladders
that go up on several levels,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.712 align:middle line:90%
maybe three.

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:24.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say three.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:84%
It could have been more,
but at least three levels.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Then you'd had little
walkways there.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And you'd have
compartments there

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:90%
that people, or entities--

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, I still
consider them to be

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:90%
people within their own right--

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:90%
that would go in there.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether they
were living quarters, what

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:90%
they were actually there for.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.485 align:middle line:90%
But they served a purpose.

00:03:48.485 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
But there were rooms
onboard the craft.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there a type of
cockpit or chair or anything

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: A control compartment
which they obviously had.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.230 align:middle line:84%
The way I remember it, there
was like a control panel.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.330 align:middle line:90%
There was two seats in front.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:90%
There was a seat in back.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And on back over where the
entrance was on each side,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:90%
there was a seat there.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, the control panels was
unique in that they didn't

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
have, like onboard
a fighter aircraft

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:90%
you have a control stick.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:84%
It was like, I know
this now but it was just

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
the impression at the time
that they were controlling

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:84%
with the instruments
they had by just

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.780 align:middle line:84%
putting their hands over
it and moving them over it.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And they could control
the craft that away.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And the whole situation is,
they could program the craft

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
to be like on automatic pilot
by certain motions of the hand.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
an avoidance system

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
where they wouldn't
crash into one another.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
They would get real close
to aircraft, our aircraft,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.800 align:middle line:84%
but just before there
would be a collision,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
they would immediately
go ahead and break off

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:84%
from making contact
with the aircraft.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.260 align:middle line:84%
They had other rooms
that looked like there

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:84%
was some type of
things going on within.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.410 align:middle line:84%
They were electronic
components or something

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:90%
that they were working with.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.555 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what they were.

00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But you also had
areas that looked

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:84%
like they were living
quarters because they had

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:90%
like cots, things of that sort.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.057 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using the wrong
word cots because--

00:05:57.057 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You know,
for a general idea.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Like on a submarine
is the best way to put it.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
They also had, I guess where
they would go and change

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.200 align:middle line:84%
into various types of clothing
that they would have to wear

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:90%
to do certain functions.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:90%
They had all of that there.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But here again, where you'd go
ahead and expect to find trash

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:84%
cans where they'd have
trash put into, uh,uh.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Trash, uh,uh.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were
just so clinically--

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.208 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to describe it.

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What kind of clothing?

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:90%
And what did it look like?

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.658 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Well, they had
different colors like white.

00:06:33.658 --> 00:06:34.670 align:middle line:90%
They had yellow.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:90%
They had red.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were they two piece,
three piece, ten piece?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: They all
looked like one piece.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And once again, how
did they get into them?

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But it looked like
one size fit all.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:90%
That was the opinion that I had.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
One fascinating thing
I learned from you,

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.685 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned a propulsion unit.

00:06:56.685 --> 00:06:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Not with this craft
because I didn't have to go

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.950 align:middle line:84%
We went on one craft and
the craft was like a small--

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
the engine, the propulsion unit
was like a matchbox, as small

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:90%
as a matchbox.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, I turned to the guy
I always called the Colonel,

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.760 align:middle line:90%
this can't be a propulsion unit.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:90%
This might be a component.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:84%
But how are you going
to get a craft this big

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
to go as fast as it was
going on this small little--

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:90%
And it was rectangular.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.478 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And this is before you
realized size did not matter

00:07:39.478 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:90%
in this field of science?

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: Oh, absolutely.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I believe also
through my experience

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:84%
when being on these craft and
still only when they're on,

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
it has their own gravitational
field around them.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Which means they're
actually in their own space.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you walk on there,
now you're in their space.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And it could be as big as the
Empire State Building inside.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.130 align:middle line:84%
But look on the outside, it's
as big as a bowling ball.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: Oh, absolutely.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And I hesitate to bring this
up but it's a key point.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a scientist.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain it.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times you may
have a craft that to us

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.840 align:middle line:84%
would be maybe a little
bigger than this.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.735 align:middle line:84%
But yet, you and I could walk
around and have plenty of space

00:08:30.735 --> 00:08:31.535 align:middle line:90%
on the inside.

00:08:31.535 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're
working multidimensional

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.429 align:middle line:90%
within the craft itself.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's all interconnected.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how to explain that.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.240 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to describe this.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.980 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to put into words.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Like, in this instance,
I'm a layperson.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.570 align:middle line:90%
I know what I saw.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
I can try to put it
into words to articulate

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:90%
what it was I saw.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.382 align:middle line:90%
But it's hard to do.

00:09:03.382 --> 00:09:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there other
people there with you

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.298 align:middle line:90%
when you came in there?

00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.423 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Was it how many--

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
What was your team made up of?

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Now, with my team
we had maybe 15 to 20 people

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:90%
on each of the NBC teams.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
But you could draw
upon the resources

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
of the nearest military
installation, which

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:90%
we did quite frequently.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Because our team was
specifically geared to do

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.360 align:middle line:84%
certain things, each
member of our team.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:84%
We would go up on
other resources

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead, maybe for
other vehicles and drivers

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:84%
to move some of the stuff
that we wanted to move, some

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.520 align:middle line:84%
of the debris, even
up to and including

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.230 align:middle line:90%
the whole craft at times.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:84%
But also to provide
perimeter security

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:90%
for where the object was.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we did not want
people coming in and ask

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
questions about why we were
there and what we were doing.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you see
any language on board?

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: I saw things, but it
wasn't like English or anything

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:84%
They actually looked like,
the best thing I can do

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:90%
is say they were hieroglyphics.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And that may not even
be the appropriate term.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.230 align:middle line:90%
But you know, they were symbols.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
But I knew right
from the beginning,

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
this was, like us
writing English,

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:90%
this was their language.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And to them, they
knew how to read it.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were explaining
certain things

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:84%
in their language
for their people.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:42.215 align:middle line:84%
And they had even what
you'd consider desks.

00:10:42.215 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:84%
What I thought to be
writing instruments,

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
they definitely didn't
look like ink pens,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:84%
but they were
writing instruments.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.890 align:middle line:84%
This little thing that if
you went and tried pick it up

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and you got close to
where the desks were,

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:84%
it would start to make lines
on it wherever you moved it,

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:90%
and you wasn't touching it.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting back, OK,
this doesn't make sense.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing between
my hand and what I was

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:90%
referring to as the desktop.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:90%
But it's doing this.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's all because of a little
container over to the side

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:84%
when you touched it and
brought your hand down.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.505 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I had
to be shown to do this.

00:11:34.505 --> 00:11:36.390 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
of this, Stoney?

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:90%
Hey, that's cool.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I can
get one for my room.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:84%
But the whole
situation is, we didn't

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:90%
know what it was all about.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, it didn't stay.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But when we brought
in like a parchment,

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:84%
we felt, OK, this was
the paper they use.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
When we brought that
in and brought it over,

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.120 align:middle line:84%
then it actually
made lines on it.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.390 align:middle line:84%
You could actually
write something on it,

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:09.950 align:middle line:84%
without a pen in hand, just
like you brought your hand

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.822 align:middle line:90%
across whatever this was.

00:12:13.822 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:84%
But then they could go ahead,
and I figured, OK, they

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.988 align:middle line:90%
could have fingered it.

00:12:16.988 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:84%
They could write in
their own language.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Sarge, when you
walked onto this craft,

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.665 align:middle line:84%
did you experience any
physical anomalies?

00:12:23.665 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: There were times
you experienced things.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, when you
go from a low elevation

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:84%
to a higher elevation, you
would have like your ears pop.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.140 align:middle line:84%
You would feel like there
was a heavy pressure on you

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:90%
from time to time.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And you would experience this
when you went from compartment

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:90%
to compartment.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:90%
And how do I explain that?

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.915 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Each compartment
is inter-dimensional.

00:12:53.915 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: Absolutely.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And also it created
its own atmosphere.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And at times, you might feel
you've been on the craft

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:84%
for only a couple
minutes, get out

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and find out that maybe
an hour or two had passed.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.415 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how to explain that.

00:13:15.415 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, did somebody in the team
know what that was all about?

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite sure that
the guy I always

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:84%
called the Colonel and
his associates, they knew.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
But they never felt that it's
necessary to explain it to us.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:84%
They'd just tell
us, you're dealing

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:90%
with a different reality.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:90%
That's all you need to know.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.340 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, you were.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And you experience
different realities

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
while you were dealing with
this different reality.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So there were things
that happened.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.010 align:middle line:90%
There's no way to explain it.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:90%
At least I can't explain it.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they ever find
out where this craft came from?

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: I'm sure they did.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And they probably knew
even before we got there.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.060 align:middle line:84%
But here again, if you did
not have a need to know,

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:90%
they didn't set you--

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.780 align:middle line:84%
always remember, this
was a dish-shaped object.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:84%
When we were debriefed
as we were getting

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle line:84%
ready to leave-- because
you were always debriefed,

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
most of the times
you had an in-brief--

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:90%
but you were debriefed.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And you were never
told, OK, this

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:84%
is an extraterrestrial craft
that came from Booma-booma

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:90%
and galaxy XYZ.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:84%
No, no, you were
never told that.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:84%
This was an experimental
craft that we go all the way

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:84%
back to Project
1794 where we we're

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:84%
trying to build the
first flying disks.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have got it
perfected where

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:84%
we have a disk-shaped
object or disk-shaped craft.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:90%
But it's not perfected yet.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So we had a little accident
here and we have to recover it.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
people are out here for.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.668 align:middle line:84%
We have an effective cover
story, and this is what it is.

00:15:03.668 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:84%
If people know you're
out here in this area

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and involved with this, this
is what you need to tell them.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:84%
We also had to coordinate
with local law enforcement

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:90%
if there was any there.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.850 align:middle line:84%
We also had to be very
careful about the situation

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.125 align:middle line:84%
with the media because
there were times

00:15:20.125 --> 00:15:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that they tried to
bring the media out,

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and we want to know
what's going on.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:84%
The one time it got
way out of hand,

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's creating problems
even to this day--

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.900 align:middle line:84%
December 9, 1965,
Kecksburg, Pennsylvania.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What happened?

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: They had a
craft that crashed there.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:84%
We went ahead and tried to
say it was a Soviet satellite.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:90%
It split the town.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Those who said that nothing
happened to where-- yeah

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:90%
was a Soviet satellite.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.640 align:middle line:84%
To those who said, I went
back there, I saw it.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:10%
It was a spacecraft.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.560 align:middle line:10%
When they went ahead and
took it through the back gate

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:10%
of Lockbourne Air Force
Base, I was actually there.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.820 align:middle line:84%
I was staying with my brother
at the time who was in the Air

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.335 align:middle line:90%
Force and stationed there.

00:16:05.335 --> 00:16:07.960 align:middle line:84%
The guy I always called Captain
Brown came and got me and says,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:90%
I want to show you something.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm quite sure at
that time he thought

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.475 align:middle line:90%
it was a Soviet satellite.

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And he was going
to go back there

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to try to help convince me that
a lot of this stuff people,

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:90%
people get mixed up, and this.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:84%
We may read about
it being a UFO,

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:84%
but it is in fact, nothing
more than a Soviet satellite.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, we went back there.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:84%
He parked outside the
flight line fence.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
They brought it in
through the back gate.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And they took it to the RV
reconnaissance 47 hangar

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
because that was the most
secure hangar there on base.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:84%
They took it back
there, closed the door,

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:90%
and I had to stay in the car.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.890 align:middle line:84%
The air policeman
saw me back there,

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.470 align:middle line:90%
but didn't say anything to me.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:84%
He knew that the captain
drove the car up there.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:84%
It was a staff car identified
as a US Air Force vehicle.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:84%
So they were walking
around there.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.065 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it
was cold that night.

00:17:11.065 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:84%
There was no snow or
anything, but it's

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:90%
a really, really cold night.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:84%
If I remember correctly, the
moon was bright that night.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.515 align:middle line:84%
And he talked to another air
police that came over to him.

00:17:24.515 --> 00:17:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were
talking about, what

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:27.397 align:middle line:90%
do you think this is all about?

00:17:27.397 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Because these people
were not supposed

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:84%
to be out there
walking the perimeter

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:90%
for that gate at that time.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.105 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the brass
brought something in here

00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:90%
that they're curious about.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:90%
That's all we know.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:84%
So while they were
standing out there,

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:84%
we were there for maybe
a half hour or so.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Then they opened the hangar up.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's two staff
cars that come out

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:90%
in place of the gun jeeps.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And the cab of the
18-wheeler is now

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.500 align:middle line:90%
a commercial cab, an overhead.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
That's one that doesn't have
a hood on the front of it.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:84%
You had to actually
lift the whole thing up

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:90%
to get to the engine.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:84%
But now they're going
on to Wright-Patterson.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Then the captain, the person
I always called Captain Brown,

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.325 align:middle line:84%
he came out and he
was white as a sheet.

00:18:20.325 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:84%
He came over towards
the vehicle while they

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:84%
brought this stuff out, and they
stopped the truck real quick.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Because immediately you started
to hear this whirling sound.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you had like
this bluish-like glow

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.238 align:middle line:84%
coming up from
underneath the tarpaulin.

00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my goodness.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Then you had people
who were in white suits,

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
like scientists, that were
running around while all

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.930 align:middle line:90%
of this was going on.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.377 align:middle line:84%
I know you had the military-type
people who were concerned

00:18:47.377 --> 00:18:48.177 align:middle line:90%
and kind of--

00:18:48.177 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:90%
there was fear there.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.080 align:middle line:90%
It's the best way to put it.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But they wound up going
to Wright-Patterson.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:90%
That was their destination.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.463 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.463 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:84%
I know when they got
there they probably

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.670 align:middle line:84%
had reporters waiting to
see the gun jeeps along

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:84%
with the military cab
carrying the low-boy.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So the reporters who
were there, they never

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.750 align:middle line:84%
ever knew when they brought
that thing into the base.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But I asked the captain
when he got out, I said,

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:90%
was that a Russian satellite?

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said just like
this, no, no, that

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.130 align:middle line:90%
was not a Russian satellite.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.650 align:middle line:84%
We'll just forget
it for now, OK?

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, we never
talked about it no more.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.208 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's good
confirmation though.

00:19:39.208 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Because if there was nothing
big, he would just say it.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.190 align:middle line:84%
You've been involved with
another craft that you were on.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
elaborate on that.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: There were actually
several craft that I was

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.490 align:middle line:90%
involved with.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
There was another one that was
essentially inside/outside was

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.220 align:middle line:90%
proportionate, per se.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And this one was
maybe a 50-foot craft.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But the one unique
thing about it

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:84%
was that it had like a
slit between the wall.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was a bright
light in the back.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to know what
that bright light was.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.800 align:middle line:84%
So I went ahead and took
a paperclip, bent it,

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:84%
tried to put it
back there to see

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
if I could drag the bright
light out or at least feel

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:90%
that there is something there.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.870 align:middle line:84%
But it was just dead
space I was hitting.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:84%
But when I turned
it, it kind of made

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:90%
the opening open up a little.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Then the craft started
to vibrate like that.

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The guy standing on my right
said, what happens next?

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And in a military manner
and way of speaking, I said,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the foggiest idea.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:90%
The vibration stopped.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Then they suggested that
we don't go ahead and try

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:90%
to dig that light no more.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who told
you and instructed

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:90%
you to go after this light.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.780 align:middle line:84%
The same guy that I
always know that I always

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:90%
called the Colonel.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.980 align:middle line:84%
He was actually always,
how can I put this?

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.145 align:middle line:84%
He was my shadow when
we went on these--

00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:90%
the investigating.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:90%
I took specific orders from him.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
No one else had
the situation where

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:90%
they were to tell me anything.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And everything
and anything I did

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:84%
was to be reported
directly back to him.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Most of the other people,
to the best of my knowledge,

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:84%
had nothing to do with having
knowledge about the UFO

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.250 align:middle line:90%
being extraterrestrial.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knew it was
not an earthly craft.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.540 align:middle line:84%
But they'd always downplay that
and try to convince everyone.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.043 align:middle line:90%
It's very much an earthly craft.

00:21:49.043 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And most people when
they got out of it,

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.558 align:middle line:84%
they didn't want to
talk about it anymore.

00:21:52.558 --> 00:21:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How was the inside
of the craft compared

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:90%
to the others?

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Now, in this instance,
you actually had a cockpit

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:90%
on top of the craft.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:84%
You had there, once again
you had three seats.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:84%
You had two in
front, one in back.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:84%
That I'm pretty sure, it's where
they were controlling the craft

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:84%
You had rooms, but you didn't
have that big bay area.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, this is
a much smaller craft even

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.045 align:middle line:90%
on the inside.

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:84%
There was no difference
from the inside

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.498 align:middle line:90%
and the outside as far as size.

00:22:30.498 --> 00:22:31.915 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were these
seats that you

00:22:31.915 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
have seen in the
craft, the three seats,

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.810 align:middle line:90%
did they have controls on them?

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:90%
How large were they?

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Were they for smaller
beings or larger beings?

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: The seats on this
craft were much smaller like

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:90%
for smaller entities.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, the
seats were comfortable.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.670 align:middle line:84%
They were what you'd call if
you sat on them-- if you wanted

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:90%
to be warm, you'd be warm.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.357 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to be a little
cool, you'd be a little cool.

00:23:00.357 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:90%
They did not have this.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they looked
like pure metal seats

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:84%
but yet they didn't
make you feel

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.300 align:middle line:90%
like you were sitting on metal.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And in front, there
was that control panel

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.890 align:middle line:90%
again with the seats in front.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:21.220 align:middle line:84%
You had with the one
in back on this craft,

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.470 align:middle line:84%
you had a control
panel back there.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
who was the pilot

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and what the other two
were supposed to be doing.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But all three were connected
to the operation of the craft.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What were the colors
of the craft inside and out?

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Inside and
out, they were gray.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know, metallic gray.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.940 align:middle line:84%
The panels, they had
different colors,

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:84%
you know, the
gauges and all that.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Some of the control panels
were controlled instrument.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll put it that way.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How big were
these control panels?

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Hmm, they were maybe
about that big and in front

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:90%
of each of the seats.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: About three feet.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: 3 and 1/2, 4
feet, something like that.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was anything
displayed on there?

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.358 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: Oh, they had gauges.

00:24:11.358 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
were like the gauges

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.702 align:middle line:84%
I told you about before
that seemed two-dimensional,

00:24:15.702 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:84%
some of them were
three-dimensional

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.480 align:middle line:90%
on some of the craft.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:84%
On this craft, they
had some of both.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.240 align:middle line:84%
They had some
three-dimensional gauges.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Then they had the
two-dimensional gauges.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.760 align:middle line:90%
This one also had switches.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Those switches were black.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Like a toggle switch.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: And I don't know
what that was all about.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:84%
In the center between the two
panels, you had a large screen.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure that was
to view maybe the ground.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could see
outside of the cockpit.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:84%
But this large screen, it
could be for surveillance

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:84%
on the ground or
something like that.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:00.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite sure they
had a setup that

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:04.310 align:middle line:84%
was similar to us taking
photographs, taking pictures.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:84%
But from their technology
and from their perspective.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Then it was operational when
we went aboard the craft.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Why it was there?

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.650 align:middle line:84%
It was intact, but there
was no entities, no bodies.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the
shape of the craft?

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: This craft was much
more like an egg-shaped craft

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:90%
because it was larger in front.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Than it curved to the back.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What dimensions
are we looking at?

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.725 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Right here
we're looking at a craft

00:25:34.725 --> 00:25:41.190 align:middle line:84%
that's probably about 30-35 foot
long and maybe 12 to 15 foot

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.802 align:middle line:90%
tall.

00:25:42.802 --> 00:25:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other
shapes of craft

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
have you seen in the past?

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: I saw a
cigar-shaped craft.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I did not have the
privilege of going in it.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:90%
I had to stay out.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.200 align:middle line:84%
There was an opening, and there
were people going in and out.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.040 align:middle line:84%
But you know, they had
specific testing to do.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:84%
There have been other craft
that appear to be like,

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to put
this, but lin-shaped craft.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And did you notice
anything in particular

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:84%
about all the crafts that
maybe had something in common?

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: Not that I can recall.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:84%
The, shall I say,
battleship gray or whatever,

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.270 align:middle line:84%
was a commonality
among all of them.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you they wasn't
looking to go ahead and have

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.650 align:middle line:84%
spectacular colors,
things of this sort.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:84%
The lights they had,
wasn't like the lights

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:38.850 align:middle line:90%
we have on our craft.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.280 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
need the lights.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.740 align:middle line:84%
The lights actually
served a purpose

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:84%
of aiding in their
mode of propulsion.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And I can't explain that because
I actually ask OK, why is it

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:84%
they have sometimes blue lights,
sometimes red and blue lights,

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:90%
sometimes just white lights?

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And the way the Colonel
thought and explained it to me,

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:84%
he said, well, I guess I can
tell you that the lights have

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.490 align:middle line:84%
nothing to do with letting
other craft that might be around

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:84%
them know that
they're there, it has

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.280 align:middle line:84%
everything to do with
their propulsion system.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
that came into play.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But that's what I
was told at the time.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do the craft have
some of the same symbols?

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Well, from when I
saw, I have to use the term

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:84%
hieroglyphics because I
don't know any other term,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.490 align:middle line:84%
they would vary
from craft-to-craft.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember having
two exactly identical.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
But the key point to
remember is that out

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.470 align:middle line:84%
of me seeing some
of these, there

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:84%
were a total of 12 instances
that I was involved with.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And with that 12 that
I was involved with,

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see all the
crashes that occurred.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.320 align:middle line:84%
The situation is
that there could

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:15.550 align:middle line:84%
have been craft that originated
from the same cultures, that

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.030 align:middle line:84%
crashed at other locations,
people saw those.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.330 align:middle line:84%
This was just the exposure
that I had to the craft

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:90%
that I was involved with.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Of all these craft
that you investigated,

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.550 align:middle line:84%
were there any
lifeforms on board?

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: There was lifeforms
on a couple that I was involved

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.060 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:84%
The one in Indiantown
Gap, Pennsylvania.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Now I didn't go on
board that craft,

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.660 align:middle line:84%
but I actually got to
see the entity half out

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
of the side opening of the
craft underneath the cabin.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I know there were at least
three bodies in that craft.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:56.400 align:middle line:84%
The other craft had like
a Chinese figure on it.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And in this instance,
the entity was injured.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:02.950 align:middle line:90%
They went ahead.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And now, there's only one
which is hard to explain.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I have every
reason to believe that when

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:84%
they came to that
craft, they were trying

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.190 align:middle line:90%
to get all of their people.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Because they were going to come
and try to rescue their people.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
To leave the one behind, that
that was kind of weird and kind

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.450 align:middle line:90%
of strange.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:84%
But we went ahead
and we actually

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.900 align:middle line:90%
rendered first-aid to it.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.090 align:middle line:90%
And they moved it off.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.680 align:middle line:84%
That was the first thing they
did when we got on scene where

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.850 align:middle line:90%
that happened.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.392 align:middle line:90%
That was the Wyoming crash.

00:29:33.392 --> 00:29:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that
was the only time

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:39.590 align:middle line:84%
you saw beings that
were either dead

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:84%
or they've already
been taken off

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.490 align:middle line:90%
the craft before you got there?

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: As far as them being
associated with a craft site

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that I was at, the one I
helped there at Fort Belvoir,

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Virginia.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:55.287 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't aware of what
type of craft it got off.

00:29:55.287 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know how they came
into possession with that one.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who is
responsible for removing

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.560 align:middle line:84%
the bodies of these beings
before your team gets there?

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Well, a lot of times,
it may not have been us that

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:84%
removed the bodies or the
survivors had no injuries

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.140 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.122 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, they'd send
out a distress call.

00:30:16.122 --> 00:30:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times
their own people

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.640 align:middle line:84%
would show up first
before we even got there.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.640 align:middle line:84%
We were to stop and
go into a staging mode

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:84%
if their people were
there rescuing them.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.770 align:middle line:84%
We were not to go ahead
and move in on them.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.190 align:middle line:90%
Why that was, I have no idea.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe we could
have offered assistance.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't the game plan.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.930 align:middle line:84%
You had normally two
teams that would show up.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
You'd have the A team,
which was the first one

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:84%
to arrive within
the first two hours.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Then you would have
the B team, they

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.940 align:middle line:84%
had to be there
within four hours.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So was there a B
team or an A team

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.030 align:middle line:90%
that arrived there before us?

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know because
they never designated.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:03.700 align:middle line:84%
The only time I had a
designated was there

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:07.465 align:middle line:90%
at Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania.

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there
any time a pilot was

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.250 align:middle line:90%
needed to take the craft out?

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Or did they always just
airlift the craft out

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.550 align:middle line:90%
or take it on a flatbed?

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: We never flew one out.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And right now, I'll tell
you, the interesting thing

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:27.260 align:middle line:84%
about that is that you hear
all these talks about we back

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.120 align:middle line:90%
engineered a flying saucer.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.410 align:middle line:90%
And we're flying them.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, and it wasn't the guy
I always called the Colonel.

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:90%
This was an older guy.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm quite sure
he was a scientist.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say a civilian
scientist because he

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.570 align:middle line:90%
didn't talk like military.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, he went ahead
and he said, you know,

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.500 align:middle line:84%
we might be able to
get a pilot to where

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.610 align:middle line:84%
we can go ahead and get him
to lift one of these things

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:84%
off into the air and fly it
around for a little while.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.440 align:middle line:84%
The problem we would
have is getting

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:90%
him to land it in one piece.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.470 align:middle line:90%
So no, I don't think.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, did we back
engineer specific craft

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.930 align:middle line:84%
that was similar to
some of these craft?

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:84%
But far removed from the real
technology that was involved

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.260 align:middle line:90%
in that craft, did we do that?

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Have we been flying?

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:28.203 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest, yes,
we have done that.

00:32:28.203 --> 00:32:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how could
you tell the difference

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.360 align:middle line:84%
between an alien
re-production vehicle

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and a real
extraterrestrial vehicle?

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: The ETs have certain
functions that their craft can

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.660 align:middle line:90%
do that ours can't.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
we don't have which

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:56.590 align:middle line:84%
we may have is the
cockpit, or the pilots

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:03.780 align:middle line:84%
compartment within
its own right has

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.002 align:middle line:90%
an atmosphere within itself.

00:33:06.002 --> 00:33:10.280 align:middle line:84%
The reason I state
that, it can do

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.550 align:middle line:84%
turns and maneuvers
that would kill

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:17.400 align:middle line:90%
a pilot in a regular aircraft.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.140 align:middle line:84%
We have experienced situations
with some of our aircraft

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:84%
under combat conditions
whereas some of the maneuvers

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.040 align:middle line:84%
will actually cause some
of our pilots to pass out,

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.780 align:middle line:84%
normally it's just
for a couple seconds,

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.780 align:middle line:90%
but we know this has happened.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:36.920 align:middle line:84%
With the craft I'm talking about
right now, it doesn't happen.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.130 align:middle line:84%
If the pilot were to pass out
for just a couple of seconds

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.830 align:middle line:84%
in the craft that I'm
talking about right now,

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:47.800 align:middle line:84%
we would lose both the
pilot and the craft.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: With your own
gravitational field,

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I just believe that they can
do an unlimited amount of speed

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.730 align:middle line:90%
because you're not in this 3D.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:84%
You have created this
ionosphere around you.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.282 align:middle line:84%
So everyone in the craft
can do 1,000 miles an hour,

00:34:03.282 --> 00:34:04.240 align:middle line:90%
make a right-hand turn.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
or feel anything

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.666 align:middle line:84%
because they're like
barely in this dimension.

00:34:10.666 --> 00:34:12.874 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Well, yeah, I
mean, the whole situation is,

00:34:12.874 --> 00:34:20.330 align:middle line:84%
is that they're in a world all
to themselves because they have

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:21.150 align:middle line:90%
that atmosphere.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
feeling the G-Forces

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.830 align:middle line:90%
that are being exerted.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And also, you've
got to understand

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.690 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
special about the craft too.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:33.199 align:middle line:84%
Because when the craft is
going through these gyrations

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:90%
of speed, two things happen.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:41.960 align:middle line:84%
One, they're supposed to be
displacing the air around them

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.810 align:middle line:84%
where it goes over
the craft, collapse

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:48.560 align:middle line:84%
making a loud sonic
boom behind the craft.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.909 align:middle line:90%
This isn't happening.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:51.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.690 align:middle line:90%
There's no explanation for that.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Also, when a craft
is going that fast,

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.910 align:middle line:84%
it generates a lot of
heat on that aircraft.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Yet the aircraft is not
disintegrating in flight.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking
1,000-2,000 miles an hour.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.850 align:middle line:84%
We're talking speeds maybe up
to 5,000-6,000 miles an hour

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.800 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.315 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did you personally
experience from all of this?

00:35:21.315 --> 00:35:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: The bottom line is
that it was more confirmation

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:33.110 align:middle line:84%
that we are not alone
in the universe.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:37.360 align:middle line:84%
What brought great
concern to me was

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:43.580 align:middle line:84%
that we are learning that
they were not hostile

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.750 align:middle line:84%
towards us, that we were
learning, if we gain anything

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.590 align:middle line:84%
from gathering advanced
technology here,

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:54.380 align:middle line:84%
it should be for the
advanced technology

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:59.400 align:middle line:84%
to get us to explore other
places in the cosmos.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I already knew that we
were a world in quarantine

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.000 align:middle line:84%
because if we go ahead
with our warlike ways,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.090 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to let
us go out into space.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Sergeant Stone, thank
you for coming on this show.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.712 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: Thank you, sir.

00:36:14.712 --> 00:36:16.070 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure to be here.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:17.612 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: This is
"Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:36:17.612 --> 00:36:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'm Emery Smith
until next time.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:23.440 align:middle line:10%
