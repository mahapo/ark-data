>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty,
a retired Special Agent

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately involved
with UFO related intelligence.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Today we are discussing
the Gate 3 incident.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.025 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD C. DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Good to be on.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.595 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So tell us, what
is the Gate 3 incident?

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:41.262 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Well,
Emery, this is probably

00:00:41.262 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:84%
one of the most at one
point classified stories

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:84%
or incidents that ever
happened out of Area 51.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:84%
It beats all the other cases of
an extraterrestrial escaping,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
because there was
a lot of aspects

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.200 align:middle line:84%
to this particular
incident involving

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:90%
a lot of different people.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have
talked over the years.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
But it starts with the
fact that-- go back

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:84%
in history a little
bit, we have captured

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial creatures
or beings or entities

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
over the years from
the gift, I would say,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.480 align:middle line:84%
that were given by EBE1 in
1947 to the entities that

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
were found inside the
Kingman crash in 1953,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.910 align:middle line:90%
and then some others after that.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And we had to create
a facility for them.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Most of them at that time
period were stored at Los Alamos

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
because there were
facilities at Los Alamos that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
were built after the EBE1 was
there and the Kingman crash.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:84%
The five that they
got out of that.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So there were some facilities
at Los Alamos that were created.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And over the years,
they realized

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.814 align:middle line:84%
if they did have any kind of
conflict with extraterrestrials,

00:01:59.814 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
we, the US government, we had
to be able to put them in a jail

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
just like we would if we had
a war with the Soviet Union,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:84%
we had to put their soldiers or
captured or POWs in a facility.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So smart people
figured out that you're

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:84%
going to have to make
these facilities.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They made it
a little different.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Yeah, a
little different.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.090 align:middle line:84%
But they made them at S2
Annex North of Papoose Lake,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:90%
and they built a facility.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And some of these entities that
we captured or are obtained

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:84%
required special
living conditions,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:84%
a special environment,
atmospheres, and so forth.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And so they built this facility.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed to
be escape proof.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.537 align:middle line:90%
But again, we don't know.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know everything
about these extraterrestrials.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.595 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The full capabilities
of an unknown species.

00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: Exactly.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know
what they could do.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know if they
had supernatural powers.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So we had to build the best
facility that we could.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And we did that at--

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:84%
as it took a number of
years to build them.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And so they had a number of what
they call containment facilities

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.165 align:middle line:90%
there at S2.

00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:18.845 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And these
were underground?

00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Yeah, they
were all underground.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.220 align:middle line:84%
They had vents and they had
all these sophisticated tanks

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
of different types
of atmospheres.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
They even had some that had
a lesser gravity than earth,

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:84%
because these things that lived
on a planet that didn't have

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.690 align:middle line:90%
its higher gravity as we did.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Some had oxygen suppressors
because our oxygen--

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:84%
we talked about
this in an episode.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: The
oxygen level was--

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:90%
ours is too rich for them.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.305 align:middle line:84%
And these requirements, and plus
food and nourishment and all

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:84%
sorts of things that
they had to worry about.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And also the
materials to make those

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:84%
were different for
different species,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
like some were
organic materials,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
some they wouldn't
use metal with.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I guess there was also
problems with psionics,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.570 align:middle line:84%
making sure they couldn't
think out of the box, if you

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.510 align:middle line:90%
know what I mean.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.715 align:middle line:90%
No pun intended.

00:04:11.715 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Did you hear
anything about that?

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.298 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Yeah, you answered
all my questions for me

00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:16.458 align:middle line:90%
because that's exactly--

00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle line:84%
obviously you know
something about it

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what they require,

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:84%
because some entities were
able to bypass something

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:90%
or it was harmful to them.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Metal box, so to speak.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So they had to-- they had
to figure out and adjust

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to different needs of
these extraterrestrials.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wasn't fully
briefed on every aspect

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure, I'm thinking you
probably know a little bit more

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
about what their
needs were than I do.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.270 align:middle line:90%
But these facilities were there.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, in the 1980s,
when the Gate 3 incident

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:84%
happened, we had these
entities in captivity.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Please tell me more
about what kind of visitors

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
that you would believe that
they would be holding there,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.535 align:middle line:84%
and of course, we got to talk
about this one that got away.

00:05:09.535 --> 00:05:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Well, they
had different species.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:90%
At that time, we knew of five.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What kind of
visitor are we talking about?

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.745 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: We're talking
about the Quataloid.

00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:19.545 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:05:19.545 --> 00:05:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: That's the insect
praying mantis type looking.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:84%
About 6 foot-- could
be up to 6 foot tall.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:90%
They were the dangerous ones.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones,
as I understand,

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't know
a whole lot about.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But we acquired this
one, particular one,

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
from a crash site and it
actually harmed a human.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So we were very careful
of how we captured it

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.045 align:middle line:84%
and how we stored it at the
containment facility S2 Annex.

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, are there
different species of Quataloids?

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Yeah, because
they're genetically engineered

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:90%
and we know that much.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So there are other
species and they also

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:90%
can appear different to humans.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
They make themselves appear in
a particular manner to a human

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and would probably just
scare them, I would guess.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But we know that one
particular incident

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:84%
where one harmed
a human being, we

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:84%
felt that at that point that
these things were not friendly,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:84%
they were not
benevolent, and therefore

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that's why we had to
keep it in captivity.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And not really sure how
long it had been there.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.190 align:middle line:84%
That's one question
that was never

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:84%
answered when this
story was told

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.630 align:middle line:84%
to me by Gene Laskowski, who
was, in fact, one of the ones

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:90%
that was there.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that he knew
how long it would been there,

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:84%
but the facility
housing these things

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:84%
had been there probably
seven to 10 years.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.825 align:middle line:84%
So it probably during that
time period we obtained it.

00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why are they here?

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Are they here on--

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.780 align:middle line:90%
for peace?

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.560 align:middle line:84%
What are they-- do
they have an agenda?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: I wish we knew.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we knew
why the craft crashed.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I know that the craft
contained two others.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
There were three of
them, and two died.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:90%
And this one lived.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And it also had the ability to
heal itself, I remember that.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.040 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know much other
reason why they came here.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Their craft was one
of the bigger crafts

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:84%
that we had obtained, and it
crashed in the Nevada Desert.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.042 align:middle line:90%
And that's about all we knew.

00:07:28.042 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And I don't, again,
I don't know how long

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:90%
it had been in captivity.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.183 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So are they
concerning to us in any way?

00:07:33.183 --> 00:07:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Yes, because
they're hostile.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.507 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: And they've
already injured humans.

00:07:37.507 --> 00:07:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Elaborate that
incident that happened.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was hurt and
it just fought back.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Well, at the
time the craft crashed,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:84%
the recovery team, the STAR team
had formed at that time period,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and they were there
to recover it.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And there was also a local
law enforcement officer there.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
The local law
enforcement officer

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:84%
who had absolutely no
knowledge of any species

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.980 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
visiting Earth

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.630 align:middle line:90%
was the one that was harmed.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not sure exactly
the details in that,

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
but the other STAR team
were able to neutralize

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.662 align:middle line:90%
the Quataloid.

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:90%
So we knew it was hostile.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you've put yourself
in their position,

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
the craft crashed for
some unknown reason.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Two of their comrades are
dead and now you're alive.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And these humans are trying
to get in this craft.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a defense mechanism
might have reacted

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:90%
with this Quataloid or what--

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, we
can guess, but--

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, that's
what I'm getting at,

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:84%
is how can they just based
off that one incident,

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
say these Quataloids
are dangerous?

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
They're disrespecting
the human race here.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.993 align:middle line:90%
They're attacking us.

00:08:51.993 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:84%
It seems like there's
more to that story

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:90%
that we just don't know.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.303 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Well, the
more to the story

00:08:56.303 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:84%
is that we were able
to disable it some way.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how and transport
it to a containment facility

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and store it in a
container, basically.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would be
upset if that was me,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.020 align:middle line:84%
if I went to another
planet as an astronaut

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and I get captured and struck
and then thrown in a container.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yeah.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know how they think.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.583 align:middle line:84%
But this leads up
to why they buy it--

00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So this is the one.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead
and get into that.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.165 align:middle line:90%
Why did it escape and how?

00:09:29.165 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: It was able to
open a underground vault door.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that they ever
figured out how it opened it.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And then it had to navigate
a smaller tunnel system

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:90%
to get up to the surface.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And now this thing
was about 6 foot tall.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:90%
It had a large body mass.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't heavy, but it
was just structured larger.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:84%
It had this cape
on the back, so it

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:84%
wasn't easy-- probably
easy for it to maneuver,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.380 align:middle line:90%
but it somehow it did.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.870 align:middle line:84%
It got up to the surface
and it just took off.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does it run like a
bipedal, like on a couple legs?

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Or how?

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: It runs--

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.660 align:middle line:84%
it runs bipedal,
on two legs, yeah.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:90%
And it was able to escape.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And the alarm system that they
had inside the containment

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:90%
facility was shut off.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know that it shut
it off or how it happened.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But they had an alarm,
but it didn't activate.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So this thing was out in the
open for some time period.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How long was it
out there before they even

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:90%
knew it had escaped?

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: They had to do checks
every, I believe, two hours.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think, and it's
approximately two hours.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And when the people that were
in control of the containment

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:84%
facility found that it wasn't
in its containment area,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:90%
they set the alarm off that.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Hey, this thing is not here.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So they went down under
and they couldn't find it.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And they realized
that it had escaped.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.430 align:middle line:90%
So now they set the alarm off.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, from that point,
there was two people

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:84%
in a jeep traveling-- traveling
from one location, Groom Lake,

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:90%
into another area.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And there was a Gate 3, it
used to be called Gate 3,

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.470 align:middle line:90%
it's a different gate now.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But they're in a
jeep, a CJ-7 jeep.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And Gene Laskowski was
the driver and a passenger

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
was an OSI agent, a
counterintelligence officer

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:90%
for the base.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't me, OK?

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Everybody--

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You can tell us, Rick.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: When I tell this
story, I have to clarify,

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:90%
this was not me.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:90%
But I knew who it was.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.350 align:middle line:90%
I've worked with him.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Anyways, they were coming back.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And they go through the gate.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, at that time, the Nellis
test and Training Range

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
had a civilian
security company called

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Wackenhut that guarded
the perimeter of the base.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
They also guarded the
entry control points.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.540 align:middle line:84%
The control area of
the base was guarded

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
by Air Force security police,
both there and at Tonopah.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:90%
But this particular gate was--

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
housed a Wackenhut
security guard.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the jeep with
Laskowski and the OSI agent

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.800 align:middle line:84%
came out, originally,
they saw the guard there.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And the guard had
approved their pass

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.867 align:middle line:90%
to get into this other area.

00:12:21.867 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And they were in the other
area for several hours.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And they come back to
go back to Groom Lake,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.150 align:middle line:90%
and they come up to the gate.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.770 align:middle line:84%
At this point, they look over
and they don't see the guard.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:31.315 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Uh-oh.

00:12:31.315 --> 00:12:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: Guard is missing.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
looking and looking

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and the assistant sees
this splatter mark.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And the gate-- the
glass of the gate.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.150 align:middle line:90%
So he gets out.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this point
Laskowski has a handgun.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.000 align:middle line:90%
He's chief of security.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.200 align:middle line:90%
The OSI agent has a handgun.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And back in those days, we
carried 45s, modified 45s.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:84%
They were specially
made for OSI agents.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So the OSI agent walks up
and doesn't see the guard.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But as he goes in
the gate, he sees.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
What's left of a
human, human remains.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And so he realizes something
obviously happened.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:90%
So he runs back.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:90%
He gets on his radio.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:90%
And he had a portable radio.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And I remember what they were.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:90%
MX500 Motorola's.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately
notified his people.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.340 align:middle line:90%
The OSI agent tells Gene.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Hey, Gene, this guy
has just got massacred.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Something hit him or
something destroyed him.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And so Gene has a radio
telephone in his jeep

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:90%
and he calls his command.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, and Gene calls and said,
we need to get help out here.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.770 align:middle line:90%
And OSI agent said, same thing.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:90%
And so they're looking around.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The OSI agent-- there's a
culvert with a canal that

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.340 align:middle line:84%
runs up across the
road from the gate

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's for irrigation or
something, I'm not sure.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So the OSI agent goes
down there to look and see

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.868 align:middle line:84%
if this thing was down there,
and lo and behold, he sees it.

00:14:07.868 --> 00:14:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my goodness.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: Now, he confronts it.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And again, he only has a 45
with seven shots in it, OK?

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: And--

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's what
you mean by confront?

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.787 align:middle line:84%
He just was there
with his weapon?

00:14:19.787 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: He pulls
his weapon out,

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
he confronts it
and starts yelling

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:84%
at it because the
OSI agent number

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:90%
one doesn't know what it is.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: He has no
knowledge of this creature.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:84%
He's never been briefed
into the subject of species.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
There's certain
programs, MedStar Program

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and RLab program,
all these things

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.840 align:middle line:84%
dealt with the creatures
and the entities there.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So this OSI
agent, not to cut you off,

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:84%
is basically the first time
he's ever seen this creature.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: The first time he's
ever seen a creature, anything,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:90%
any species.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he didn't even
know that Groom Lake had

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.120 align:middle line:84%
him or Papoose Lake, S2
Annex had these things.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even think he
even knew S2 Annex existed.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, Gene knew
that they had him.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:84%
They had these
extraterrestrials because he

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:90%
was chief of security.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:90%
But the OSI agent did not know.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So when the OSI agent
went down to look,

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and he's expecting a
human did this somehow

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.090 align:middle line:84%
with maybe a ray gun or
something, but as he goes down,

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.920 align:middle line:90%
he sees this.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:90%
An entity stand up.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And these Quataloids, when
they are in danger or when

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
they try to scare a human, their
head enlarges and their cape

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:90%
opens.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So he's thinking he's looking
at some kind of a praying mantis

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:90%
that's huge.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to him
years later and he says,

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:90%
this is a Nevada test site.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:90%
They tested nuclear weapons.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:84%
There could be some strange
mutations that occurred out

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:90%
here, which they did.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:90%
There were.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he's
thinking he's looking at.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:90%
And he's yelling at it.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And I we always joke about this.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, not always, but
when I talk to him.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you expect
this thing to answer back?

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, hey, I'm trained to
challenge it before I shoot.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.850 align:middle line:90%
I did what I--

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.472 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So what was he saying?

00:16:27.472 --> 00:16:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Like, get out of there?

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:29.235 align:middle line:90%
Or what was he saying?

00:16:29.235 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: Get out of there!

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, get out of there!

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Keep your hands in the air!

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Typical challenge that a law
enforcement person would do.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:37.800 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't do it.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
It came at him and he
fired his 45 at him,

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.160 align:middle line:84%
hitting the creature
in the chest.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:90%
The creature fell down.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
He thought that the creature--
he killed the creature.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, at that time,
Gene is behind him.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, Gene has a 38
model, 1938, six shot.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Same thing the security
police carried.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:90%
He never fired.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But Gene, says get back, get
back, get back to the OSI agent.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And the OSI agent says,
what the heck is that?

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
He says, it's an
extraterrestrial creature

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:90%
that's contained here.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.180 align:middle line:90%
And it must have escaped.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:84%
And the fumes, when
it dies, is harmful.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So they all got back
up towards the gate.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And some time later, other
security police and security

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:84%
force people arrived on scene,
and also the containment unit.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
They had a containment team
that can contain this thing.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
contain this thing,

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:90%
put it in a container.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't dead, and
then transported it back

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.340 align:middle line:90%
to the containment center.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And now the
investigation starts.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
They had to bring in the
FBI because he's a civilian.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.910 align:middle line:90%
The guard was a civilian.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Now we have the
FBI, an outside agency,

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.655 align:middle line:84%
involved in this highly
classified investigation.

00:17:57.655 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well, that's not good.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.325 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't sweep that
under the rug that one, huh?

00:18:02.325 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: They
couldn't sweep it

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.765 align:middle line:84%
because they notified
everybody and your uncle.

00:18:05.765 --> 00:18:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, you mentioned this cape
that he was wearing, or was it

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.988 align:middle line:84%
part of his body,
his segmented body?

00:18:12.988 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: That was
part of his body.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the body.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.335 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Like wings?

00:18:18.335 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: It's like wings.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:84%
It's contained in
the back of its neck.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: And remember,
it's a praying mantis

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:90%
type looking entity.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And its head can also enlarge.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.540 align:middle line:90%
And the cape is behind.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.270 align:middle line:90%
And they sometimes hide in it--

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:90%
hide in it.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I was told that when they
first captured this one

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and put it in there, it would
put the cape over it and hide.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably used
to scare or frighten.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Now they have to investigate it.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Now, this human being
was virtually disintegrated,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:18:59.840 align:middle line:90%
the guard.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And so how did this
entity, being do that?

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.930 align:middle line:84%
This is what really,
really, really scared

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.530 align:middle line:84%
everybody there because
they didn't know that it

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.280 align:middle line:90%
had a capability of doing that.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.020 align:middle line:84%
They knew it had a
capability of clawing a human

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.905 align:middle line:84%
and harming him
with its strength.

00:19:20.905 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I was going to ask you,
like, a mantis has those really

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:90%
razor sharp claws on it.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Also, this creature have this?

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Well, they
thought that at first,

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:84%
but when they took
it back and they,

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I guess, they put it to sleep,
anesthetized it or something,

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:84%
to search it, they
found these glands.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And these glands
had acid in them.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: And they didn't
know that these glands--

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:90%
they didn't even know.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And they had this thing
for some time, years.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.980 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't know
that the anatomy of it,

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
inside of its claws
had this acid.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: And what they found
because they took these things

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.630 align:middle line:84%
out, and this acid,
they call it an acid,

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.400 align:middle line:84%
it's some kind of a
chemical, was the same

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:90%
as inside that gate shack.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.975 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the
color of the Quataloid.

00:20:12.975 --> 00:20:14.317 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: It's a dark brown.

00:20:14.317 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Dark brown?

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.375 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: Dark brown colored.

00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How are the eyes?

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Big, oval?

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: Very, very big.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Very sophisticated.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:10%
Has a number of lenses, lids.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:84%
It could-- they actually think
it could see through things.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What were the next
steps after this very horrible

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:90%
encounter with the Quataloid.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Well,
this is where it

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.080 align:middle line:84%
gets somewhat
difficult to talk about

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:84%
because they went back and did
a lot of different experiments

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:90%
and tests on this Quataloid.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:84%
We were able to put it to
sleep somewhat with some gas--

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:53.090 align:middle line:84%
gas or some method, to put
it to sleep, to examine it,

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Because once they
found the chemical that

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.180 align:middle line:84%
dissolved human skin, now
they're really, really worried.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, well,
if we took this gland out,

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.445 align:middle line:90%
do they grow another one?

00:21:05.445 --> 00:21:06.245 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:21:06.245 --> 00:21:07.045 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:21:07.045 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: How can
we prevent this thing

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:90%
from harming any humans again?

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.415 align:middle line:90%
So what they decided--

00:21:15.415 --> 00:21:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I guess this went
all the way up.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.395 align:middle line:84%
What they decided to do was
neutralize it or terminate it.

00:21:20.395 --> 00:21:21.455 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How unfortunate.

00:21:21.455 --> 00:21:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Yeah, how
unfortunate because apparently

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.770 align:middle line:84%
we only had one of
them at that time.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was providing us with a
lot of medical research and bio

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.680 align:middle line:84%
research on what other species
throughout the universe

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.070 align:middle line:90%
looks like or acts like.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: ANd what they're
made of and whether they have--

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.250 align:middle line:84%
eventually I'm sure they
would have tested the DNA.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But back in those days, although
they knew that there was DNA,

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
able to test it.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it shows
you how frightened

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:84%
the team was to not allow
this creature to live because

00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:00.210 align:middle line:84%
of its unpredictability
and our unawareness of what

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.200 align:middle line:90%
it's capable of.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: Exactly.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And you stop and think of how
rash that was for us to do

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.100 align:middle line:90%
or how difficult that--

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:84%
but what else were
we going to do?

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the
questions I had was,

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:84%
why couldn't you put it
back in its spaceship

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:90%
and send it off planet?

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Did you ask that?

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.715 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Yeah, I
asked that question.

00:22:23.715 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And the person telling me
this story, Gene Laskowski,

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%
said, do you actually
think we would

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:35.520 align:middle line:84%
trust them to fly that
spacecraft back to his planet

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:84%
when we've just
done this to them?

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:84%
What if there was
some horrible weapon

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.927 align:middle line:84%
system they had on that craft
that we haven't found yet?

00:22:42.927 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: We had the craft.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Yeah,
we have the craft,

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know its
full capability because we

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:90%
haven't reverse engineered it.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So you imagine us just putting
them in the craft and saying,

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:90%
get back to your planet?

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't been able to
communicate fully with it.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't any other
choice but to neutralize it.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.190 align:middle line:90%
And they never said kill it.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:90%
They said neutralize it.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you
aware of any time

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that we had a
Quataloid in captivity

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:84%
or any other extraterrestrial
that these other beings

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:84%
from the same race came
to try to help it escape?

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: There have been
stories of that happening,

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily the
Quataloid, but there

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:90%
have been others' stories.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the full
details, but there

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:84%
have been others
that came and got

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and captured or released
or freed their own.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:90%
One particular case in the old--

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:84%
the former Soviet Union
that this happened.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about that
in one of these episodes

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.810 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there have
been cases, but I

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.800 align:middle line:84%
don't know of any
relating to the Quataloid.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So where do you think
this incident taught us,

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and how does that change
what we do in the future

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.430 align:middle line:84%
when we capture these
extraterrestrials?

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Well, Gene said
that they did, obviously,

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:84%
the after action report that a
team came in from headquarters,

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:10.430 align:middle line:84%
did a full investigation,
developed new policies

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and procedures for the
containment facility,

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.680 align:middle line:84%
modernized the
containment facility,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and then set procedures
on if we were going

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.360 align:middle line:84%
to bring a species in
the containment facility,

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.910 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to
know a lot about them

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:31.080 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that they
can be properly cared for

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:90%
and not escape.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And every communications
effort possible

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.353 align:middle line:84%
must be made to try to get
through them, to inform them

00:24:43.353 --> 00:24:44.770 align:middle line:84%
that we're not
going to harm them.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm sure security
checks are not going to be just

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:90%
every two hours moving forward.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: No.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:53.325 align:middle line:84%
I think they've created a new
system with closed circuit

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:54.125 align:middle line:90%
cameras.

00:24:54.125 --> 00:24:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, do you know
our current relationship

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:90%
with Quataloids?

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: No.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know there's
others here now,

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.750 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know the
full story about what

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.235 align:middle line:90%
our relationship is with them.

00:25:05.235 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned these
down craft and the dark teams

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:09.870 align:middle line:90%
come.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:84%
We seem to be pretty aggressive
from what you told us.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Is there any way
moving forward that you

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:84%
think we wouldn't be so
aggressive to these beings?

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: Yeah, I
think now the STAR team

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.410 align:middle line:90%
has modernized its approach.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:84%
They have psychologists
and clairvoyant people,

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.470 align:middle line:84%
paranormal people
who immediately

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:36.830 align:middle line:84%
will try to communicate in a
different way other than vocal.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have learned
our lesson and we

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.665 align:middle line:84%
do have some different
specialties on the STAR team

00:25:42.665 --> 00:25:43.465 align:middle line:90%
nowadays.

00:25:43.465 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So in regards to
the Quataloids as a species,

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:84%
there's so many different kinds
of these Quataloids and races.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
What's your take
on the Quataloids

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.315 align:middle line:84%
as far as are they
good, are they bad?

00:25:57.315 --> 00:25:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Through your
experience, you just

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.093 align:middle line:84%
mentioned this negative
history of what just happened,

00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:04.135 align:middle line:84%
but have you heard of
anything that was positive?

00:26:04.135 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>C. DOTY: First of all, a
Quataloid is an insectoid, OK?

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But we can't categorize
all Quataloids

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:90%
with being malevolent.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:18.690 align:middle line:90%
They might not be.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:84%
There are so many other
species that are not dangerous.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are actually very,
very benevolent to humans.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we can't categorize
just this one incident

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.172 align:middle line:84%
as being so negative
against all insectoids.

00:26:36.172 --> 00:26:38.533 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, thank
you so much, Rick,

00:26:38.533 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:90%
for being on the show.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:84%
That was always a
fascinating story you told,

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.413 align:middle line:90%
and I appreciate you being here.

00:26:43.413 --> 00:26:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>C. DOTY: Thank you, Emery.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
