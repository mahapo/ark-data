00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Dr. Robert Wood,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:10%
retired aerospace engineer who
has worked on everything from

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.290 align:middle line:10%
ballistic missile defense
to the Space Station.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.619 align:middle line:84%
More recently, Bob is the
editor of a new book on William

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Tompkins called "Selected
By Extraterrestrials,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Volume 2, My Life in The
Top Secret World of UFOs,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Think Tanks, and
Nordic Secretaries."

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:90%
Bob, welcome to the show.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, this latest book about
William Tompkins was taken

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:10%
directly from his own words left
on his computer after he passed

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:10%
away in August of 2017.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of this information
he has shared previously

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:90%
in the public.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:90%
But much of it is new.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about some of his
outstanding experiences

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.940 align:middle line:90%
that you came across.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are three things
in the new book that I think

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:90%
are quite significant.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:10%
The first is there's a lot
more detail on the interviews

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:10%
that he was involved with
Admiral Rico Botta, where

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:10%
they were interviewing
29 Navy spies who

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.250 align:middle line:10%
had been in Nazi Germany.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.287 align:middle line:84%
And the new book basically
goes into those in some detail.

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's really convincing.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.480 align:middle line:84%
You get a feeling
that you're there.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:10%
The second thing that impressed
me was the details that he

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:10%
was able to add about
his time at the Douglas

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.375 align:middle line:10%
think tank, which is where
I worked at the same time

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:10%
with the same people.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:10%
In fact, his main guy, his
main boss in the Douglas

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.043 align:middle line:10%
think tank was my boss years
before when he hired me.

00:01:48.043 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:10%
And so I think
that's significant.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:10%
One of the people in that think
tank who was running the show

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:10%
was Bobby Ray Inman, who is now
an admiral, when he was just

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:10%
a kid.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
interesting, too.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the first
book only went up to 1970,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:90%
when he started to work at TRW.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.160 align:middle line:10%
And at TRW, he was involved in
some deeply classified programs

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.280 align:middle line:10%
all over the map, which he never
discussed in his first book

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.080 align:middle line:10%
at all.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about remote
viewing, for example,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and underground tunnels
and caverns and all sorts

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.400 align:middle line:90%
of exciting stuff.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>> For the audience, Bob,
tell them what TRW stands for.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Thompson Ramo Wooldridge is
the name of the three people

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.060 align:middle line:84%
who founded the company
which became TRW.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Then I believe it
became Aerospace.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:90%
And then it got sold again.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:84%
What he did at TRW
was so important.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It's because TRW had no limits
on what they could investigate.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And so they investigated
how to find out

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
to make cars that don't
have to run on gasoline,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and how remote viewing
really works, and is there

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:84%
anything to psychic phenomena,
and all sorts of things

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would an aerospace
company be interested

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
in psychic phenomenon
and remote viewing?

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, according to what
Bill Tompkins told me,

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
they were really funded
by the Detroit businesses.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
oriented towards gas.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Detroit
businesses meaning--

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Meaning yeah, the oil
companies and the car

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:90%
companies.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:84%
These were the ones
that were funding TRW.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of his stories,
which is included in detail,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:84%
is the story of how
they hired the guy

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Joe Papp
who claimed that he could

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:90%
make cars just run on water.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they developed
a program to do that.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And they got a car
that just ran on water.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
They got an engine that just ran
on water and demonstrated it.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:90%
But unfortunately, it blew up.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:10%
And then after that
happened, all the funding

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:10%
was totally canceled.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Just from that one accident?

00:03:58.285 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And Bill Tompkins was
actually the project manager

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.040 align:middle line:90%
of this project.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So where did they
all go from there?

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> They were told by the oil
companies to not try to pursue

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:84%
other techniques
for transportation.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Were they threatening them?

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>> He never discussed
the processes they used.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But it was pretty clear
that's what happened.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So Bob, why were they
interested in remote viewing?

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Bill made it very
clear that TRW's scientists were

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.360 align:middle line:84%
encouraged to be interested
in any unanswered questions.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.270 align:middle line:84%
They asked questions, well, how
were the pyramids really built.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Then actually tried
to build a pyramid

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:90%
with the technology of the day.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And so anybody had a
question about anything,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that was a guaranteed thing
you wanted to explore,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.380 align:middle line:84%
especially if it was
potentially important.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, nobody understood
how remote viewing worked

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:84%
or whether it worked,
as an example.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.090 align:middle line:84%
They also didn't understand
UFOs and why they were real

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:84%
or whether they were real
and how did they work.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:90%
So they did that, too.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.017 align:middle line:84%
There was a group
of scientists who

00:05:04.017 --> 00:05:06.350 align:middle line:84%
were given a green light to
study anything that occurred

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:90%
to their minds as interesting.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, tell me
about the book title.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Selected
By Extraterrestrials."

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Why did he come up with that?

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Why did you come up with that?

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it turns out that there
were really a couple of reasons

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:90%
why he picked that title.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:84%
The first was when
he was looking

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
for a title for his first
book he was talking to a girl

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:84%
that he knew casually, I
think one of his editors.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
They were talking about
what to title the book.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
in the first place,

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:90%
girls read more books than guys.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And so you ought
to pick something

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.885 align:middle line:84%
that has some sort of
appeal, that's relationships.

00:05:49.885 --> 00:05:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And the other reason
that he picked the title

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
is because he
personally believed

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
that he was, in fact,
selected by a Nordic group

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
during the battle
of LA in 1942 when

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:84%
he was illuminated
by a bright light

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and selected as their man
to represent their goals

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:90%
for the near future.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We have some interviews
done with William Tompkins.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:84%
This one is a brief clip
about Bill's early involvement

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:90%
in secret programs.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a look.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So I went to work,
then, at Douglas.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.400 align:middle line:10%
And I'm a draftsman
for two weeks.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:10%
And my chief, section chief,
started through my background.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
says all of this stuff

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:90%
that I had done in the Navy.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So he puts me in
this think tank.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we get
to the first think tank.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It's inside of Douglas
in a walled off area.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And there's 200 guys in it.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:03.380 align:middle line:10%
And we investigate every aspect
of extraterrestrial, military,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:10%
commercial, whatever.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:10%
And I was assigned to
design for the Navy

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:10%
about 16, 18 different classes
of US Navy battle group ships,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:10%
which didn't exist.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.600 align:middle line:10%
And the larger ones were from
1 kilometer to 6 kilometer.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:10%
These ships fly in space.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:10%
They're space craft carriers.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.530 align:middle line:10%
I designed US Navy
spacecraft carriers,

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:10%
which finally got built back
in the late '70s, up in Utah,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.790 align:middle line:10%
underneath the ground.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen the pictures
of US Navy spaceships, Solar

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Warden.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So Solar Warden came out
of a think tank inside

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:90%
of engineering at Douglas.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And a whole lot of
other stuff came out.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So Bob, tell us more about
what Bill shares from these

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.873 align:middle line:84%
think tank sessions of US
Navy spaceships from his book.

00:08:12.873 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the clip that
we just saw is particularly

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the two
drawings that were shown

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.403 align:middle line:84%
there were in his
own handwriting

00:08:20.403 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:90%
with his own initials in it.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And I have a copy of the
original that shows that.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.950 align:middle line:10%
So I think that was
very significant.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:84%
He claimed that the first
satellite that we ever put up

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.255 align:middle line:90%
was actually a Navy submarine.

00:08:37.255 --> 00:08:39.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, submarines
are sealed, so you don't

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:90%
have to do anything special.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.179 align:middle line:84%
They had taken out
the nuclear engine

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and put in the
anti-gravity engine.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And it took off from Newport
News and went to orbit.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd never seen that
in writing anywhere else.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
I've heard him say it,

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.410 align:middle line:90%
the interviews that I've seen.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So that would be new information
that came from my conversation

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.410 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, anti-gravitic
propulsion units.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Understood.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Germans had a very
developed space program, like,

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything we seem
to have at that time.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And according to
William Tompkins,

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.600 align:middle line:84%
how did they just become
so advanced so fast?

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The reputations the Germans
had for having a high quality

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:84%
UFO actually is a
little complicated.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Because what would
happen to begin with

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:84%
was that Maria Orsic
had a relationship that

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:84%
resulted in her
receiving psychically

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:90%
the designs and drawings.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And so there were a group
of people in Germany

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.710 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to build these
craft on those drawings

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:90%
and leave the planet.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:84%
In the mid-30s, Bill tells
me that the reptilians, who

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.800 align:middle line:84%
had underground
bases in Antarctica,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
made a deal with the Germans
who were exploring Antarctica

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:84%
at that time to help
conquer the world.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And they had also the same kind
of craft, anti-gravity craft.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So the Germans were working
two programs at the same time.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:84%
They were working one that
was related to the drawings

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
that they had received help
from from the reptilians.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were also working
on Maria Orsic's development.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And the Nazis SS let them do
those things at the same time

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:84%
because there was
some synergism there.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And tell the audience
about Maria Orsic.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Maria Orsic is one
of half a dozen girls who,

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
in the early '20s, I think,
had wanted to leave the Earth.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And she was sufficiently
psychic that she

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:84%
was able to communicate
with a race that

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:84%
was on a planet around
the star Aldebaran.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And the story is that they gave
her the drawings psychically.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to work with a
university professor in Germany

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
to take those drawings
and create a craft.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
anti-gravity craft

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:84%
really took off sometime
in, maybe, 1922.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Did we learn anything about
the species that Maria Orsic

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.110 align:middle line:10%
was involved with and were they
helping the Nazis build these

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.920 align:middle line:10%
craft?

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill did not tell me anything
about the species on the planet

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.143 align:middle line:84%
around Aldebaran that
gave her the designs.

00:11:46.143 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what kind of
race they might have been.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:90%
So it would be a guess.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.017 align:middle line:84%
All we know is that she got
these drawings psychically.

00:11:54.017 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:90%
And they built them.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:55.960 align:middle line:90%
And they worked.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:90%
That's what he told me.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's have a look
at this video with William

00:11:59.458 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Tompkins about Germans in space.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.050 align:middle line:10%
>> It's '42, 1942.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:10%
The war's on.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:10%
Rico Botta, his hobby is
sending these Navy operatives

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:10%
into Germany.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:84%
They've been going
all over Germany.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And they're staggered
at what they've found.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.250 align:middle line:84%
They've found that
Hitler and the SS

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
made an agreement with
reptilian extraterrestrials.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:34.280 align:middle line:10%
They found hundreds of different
types of advanced weapons being

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.900 align:middle line:10%
built.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:10%
These included 60
foot and 250 foot,

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:10%
500 foot UFOs,
round vehicles, OK?

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:90%
UFOs.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:84%
They built some of these
out of Chromoly steel.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
It would weigh tons
and tons and tons.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:10%
They had developed,
or they had been

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:10%
given, electromagnetic
anti-gravitational propulsion

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:10%
by the reptilians.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
The agreement
turned out that they

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:84%
were to develop a parallel space
navy that the reptilians had

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and operate out through the
galaxy with the reptilians

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.550 align:middle line:84%
taking over planets and slaving
the people on the planets.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:23.050 align:middle line:84%
But what they had
already accomplished

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:90%
was really strange.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.410 align:middle line:84%
They have all these
UFOs, different types

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:84%
of propulsion that
were unbelievable,

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:37.090 align:middle line:84%
laser weapon systems,
unbelievable stuff.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
All over the country, Germany
and the occupied areas,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
they had massive underground
production facilities

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that they were using that they
had developed for regular arms

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:84%
waste, like tanks and
places to build navy ships

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.530 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of stuff.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Most of it was underground.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So they started expanding
those facilities.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:10.400 align:middle line:10%
And they put 11 of these UFO
shape vehicles in production.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So the operatives are
trying to explain to us,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and the admiral would back
off and say, slow down.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe you.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:90%
And that went on.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the captains
would say the same thing.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.763 align:middle line:90%
The operatives were nice guys.

00:14:25.763 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And they knew they were going to
get the questions when they got

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.252 align:middle line:90%
back into the Admiral's office.

00:14:30.252 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that
nobody was going

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:90%
to believe what they said.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So fortunately, the Admiral
had a typist in there.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Admiral's
aide was not in there,

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.260 align:middle line:84%
he wasn't even cleared
to be in there.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And one or two of the captains,
the admiral, and myself, and we

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
were the only people
that this information

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:90%
was given to by the operatives.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to step sort
of back to my job

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:84%
in the Navy there working
for Admiral Rico Botta.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.950 align:middle line:90%
We talked about my mission--

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:90%
not my job, my mission.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.360 align:middle line:90%
It's documented.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:84%
It's written by the Secretary
of Navy Forrestal who

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:84%
became the number one
guy in the military.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:10%
Then he, like
several other people,

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:10%
including our
president at that time,

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:10%
were talking to a
lot of other people.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And so he was supposed to
have had a mental breakdown.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.025 align:middle line:84%
So they took him to
the hospital there

00:15:34.025 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:84%
in Washington at the top floor
and pushed him out the window.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the guy that
wrote Admiral Rico Botta's

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:48.800 align:middle line:84%
mission, which has been--
my mission came from his.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
That was the level of this
information in the United

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Now no other country
but Germany knew

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:90%
about the extraterrestrials.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Nobody did.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Now as they start to unveil
a reality of what Germany

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
was doing, it was, like, the
war is going to be over, period.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:84%
They're going to take
the whole planet.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And they could do
it in five minutes.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:24.560 align:middle line:84%
They even had trained
a group of soldiers,

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:84%
en entire battalion of
them who were cloned.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:84%
They had cloned a whole
battle group of soldiers.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:84%
They sent him out front and
they were killing the Russians

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.810 align:middle line:90%
unbelievably.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just the material.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But-- and advance medical
systems, longer lives, the size

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and the magnitude of
what was taking place

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
was unbelievable
to everybody that

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:90%
got involved in the program.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
The SS found out that
people could live longer.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So there was another
big massive program

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:84%
given in pieces brought back by
the Navy operatives, plopped it

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.720 align:middle line:84%
on the table in front
of Admiral Rico Botta.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that ended
up with about 24 packages

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.890 align:middle line:84%
because of the different
magnitudes of living longer.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And I guess if you ask the
question for the Nordics,

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
their comparable life spans
are 1,400 to 2,200 years.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:90%
But they look exactly like us.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:84%
There is a study
that we did later

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:50.485 align:middle line:84%
on at TRW on advanced life
systems, yes, extended life.

00:17:50.485 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And that program is down now
to within less than two years.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:02.320 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be available to
some people on this planet.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:90%
The way it works--

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm very involved with it--

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.990 align:middle line:84%
essentially, you take four
aspirin over six months,

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.790 align:middle line:90%
pop them.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Or you get four shots.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:90%
And you immediately change.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Everything is nicer.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything is nicer.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you revert
back to the girls, 21,

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:90%
and the guys, 29.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Now it takes a while
for you to do this.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:84%
You then stay at that
time for, essentially,

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:90%
a couple of thousand years.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Your brain, then, which
collectively we're

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:84%
only using 2.2% of
our brain, I don't

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.660 align:middle line:90%
care what they're telling us.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.100 align:middle line:90%
We're only using 2.2 percent.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:84%
You get a minimum
of 400% capability

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:90%
over what you normally had.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And now what this does is
this allows you to contribute,

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:90%
allows you to contribute.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.350 align:middle line:84%
You go to work for
the company here,

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
20 years they give
you the watch,

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a couple,
three years later on.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:90%
And you're out of the picture.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't
contribute very long.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Now you're living 2,000 years.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can contribute,
and you also

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:90%
can have fun for 2,000 years.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.800 align:middle line:90%
And you don't change age.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.630 align:middle line:90%
You stay there.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:46.420 align:middle line:10%
Five of the top medical
research groups,

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:10%
just like Scripps right
here in San Diego,

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:10%
are involved in this.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:10%
And there's hundreds of
companies involved in this.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
lot out there that

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:04.900 align:middle line:84%
is being removed from
our part of our life.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:10.170 align:middle line:10%
And that we are in
this position where

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.450 align:middle line:10%
everything that we've
been taught, whether it's

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:16.560 align:middle line:10%
in the university or in medical
or in any technical field, even

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:10%
mathematics, is baloney.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Yet, because we have
allowed reptilians

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:84%
to put the stuff in our minds,
it removes our capability

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
to operate, learn our
entire history, all the way

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.840 align:middle line:84%
back thousands of years,
has been being controlled.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:90%
We now know this.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.470 align:middle line:84%
This is not something that
we think could happen.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.040 align:middle line:90%
We now know this.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:90%
So if you look at countries.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:90%
You look at the Roman times.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And you see, if you take in
parallel these events back

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:84%
with that, the Romans were
being mind-controlled.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.303 align:middle line:90%
They had the elite group.

00:21:05.303 --> 00:21:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And then they had
all of the army.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:90%
And then they had the slaves.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we are now.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:84%
We're just finding
out about this.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:90%
And we need to fix it.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Did Bill share anything
that you can comment on about

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
the life extension that
was just mentioned?

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:10%
You know, taking these
pills, getting inoculations?

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as I got to know
Bill pretty well over the 10

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
or so years before
the book came out,

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:84%
I began to ask him really
personal questions.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, Bill,
you're talking about this.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:90%
You're getting old.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Like, he was 92 at the time
or something like that.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I said, are you
taking pills or not?

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.340 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, I'm not.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I think for the most part,
when he and I were talking

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and I looked him in the eye, he
would tell me the real truth.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:10%
I mean even through my
experience in the projects,

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle line:10%
we definitely were experimenting
with longevity and also

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:10%
deep space travel and keeping
the body at a certain age.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.980 align:middle line:10%
Not so much, you
know, taking it back,

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:10%
but at least keeping the
person from aging any longer.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he's mentioning,
also, clones.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that is something
I'm very familiar with.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:10%
And I definitely
believe in that.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.040 align:middle line:90%
What's your thoughts on that?

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I thought that
the video we just saw,

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:84%
where he mentioned that
the Germans actually had--

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:84%
the Italians had cloned guys,
that was a new thought for me,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.300 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans might have
been that good that early.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.490 align:middle line:90%
They had so much help.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:90%
And they were so smart.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that's possible.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
any evidence for it.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
have any evidence.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.198 align:middle line:90%
but the one thing I did learn--

00:23:01.198 --> 00:23:02.240 align:middle line:90%
this is kind of an aside.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing that
I learned as a result

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:84%
of meeting Bill and
understanding his story

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:84%
is there's almost nothing
that can't be kept secret

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:84%
effectively by the
government and by people

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.710 align:middle line:90%
who want it kept secret.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.830 align:middle line:84%
There are no limits
on the ability

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:90%
of people to keep secrets.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of the
people in the world today

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:84%
do not believe that there is
an underground tunnel system

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and cavern system for sending
people here and there covertly.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And most people do not
believe or have ever heard

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:84%
of a secret space
program that has

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
multiple different craft with
multiple different visitors

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:90%
from various places.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So those things have
been kept secret

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:47.750 align:middle line:84%
from the public, in fact,
very, very effectively.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:90%
I had a top secret clearance.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And I met a lot of
people who thought

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.110 align:middle line:84%
they knew at all when they had
the right level of clearance.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.330 align:middle line:90%
But it turns out they didn't.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:84%
There's no level
of clearance you

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
could have that gives you access
to the things that are really

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:90%
kept secret.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying eventually
the truth always comes out

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.420 align:middle line:90%
with these projects?

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Or are you saying
that we'll never know?

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there is no plan at
the present time for the secret

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:90%
to be revealed.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Because for the
most part, there is

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:84%
no one person who knows
the secret, especially

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.755 align:middle line:90%
the president.

00:24:27.755 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, little
bits and pieces.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.755 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's a
good way to put it,

00:24:30.755 --> 00:24:33.030 align:middle line:90%
no one person knows everything.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so
compartmentalized.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's also
disinformation sometimes thrown

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:38.750 align:middle line:90%
into it--

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>> --to discombobulate these
people with high clearance.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, William writes about
having worked with the Nordics.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how did that come about?

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And in what fashion
did he work with them?

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Bill emphasized that
he had some secretaries who he

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:04.230 align:middle line:84%
later found and concluded they
were Nordic secretaries who

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
were so important to him because
he realized that they were

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.830 align:middle line:84%
actually helping him
be the person he was.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Bill was not a modest guy.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And he made a lot of claims
of having the right idea

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.180 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he quotes his
bosses as saying, Bill,

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.830 align:middle line:84%
you're always
right on top of it.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.400 align:middle line:84%
But in the book, he
admits that really most

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:84%
of the really good
ideas that he got

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.660 align:middle line:84%
came from his secretaries
who were Nordic

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and gave him the
right information.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Bob, if the Nordics
are so brilliant--

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:39.880 align:middle line:84%
they know telepathy, they
know a lot more than we do--

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.783 align:middle line:84%
why were they put in
place as his secretaries?

00:25:43.783 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the simplest,
most straightforward answer

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.110 align:middle line:84%
to that is you'd have
to ask the Nordics.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But they decided
that this was a way

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:84%
to have a non-obvious
influence on the process,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to having a higher
level situation where it would

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:84%
have been evident
to lots of people

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:84%
that the Nordics were
somehow controlling things.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:84%
I think they wanted to
stay in the background.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.640 align:middle line:84%
The impression I
got from Bill was

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.580 align:middle line:84%
that the Nordics wanted
the Apollo program

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:90%
to be successful.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to help
him make it successful.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And he gives a lot
of details as to how

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.190 align:middle line:84%
he helped them make it
successful with the help

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:26.210 align:middle line:90%
of the Nordics.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.043 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think it's
really strategic, too.

00:26:28.043 --> 00:26:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Because it blends in.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, they blend
in with his team.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.065 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's have a look at
this video with Maria Orsic

00:26:34.065 --> 00:26:34.900 align:middle line:90%
and the UFOs.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So we had a
young girl, Nordic,

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:90%
just outside of Germany.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Some people talked to her.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And they said you are now
involved in a new program.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have
great support in this program.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.770 align:middle line:90%
She had developed--

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.240 align:middle line:90%
I think she had eight girls.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:84%
They were continually
talked to telepathically

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.760 align:middle line:90%
to go and design spaceships.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:10%
The little blonde
actually built them.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, two of those
got over here in Area 51.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But Germany found
out about the blonde.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Took her over,
stopped everything.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, got to
this point where

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:84%
there was some sort of
pressurized program by the SS

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:90%
to control that original group.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Now several times they
did work together.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But Hitler allowed them
to operate independently

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.270 align:middle line:84%
of the whole SS program,
a whole development.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So we had two developments
going on in Germany.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:84%
The girls didn't
want their vehicles

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.360 align:middle line:84%
to be used for anything
else but travel.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.210 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid that somebody
would get a hold of it

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:90%
and they'd use it for military.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Which is, of course,
what they got.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But the girls finally
ended up in Antarctica

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.945 align:middle line:90%
in the large facilities.

00:28:14.945 --> 00:28:22.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the reptilians
had three massive caverns.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.960 align:middle line:84%
They let Germany
use two small ones.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
talking about small,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.910 align:middle line:84%
it's, like, as
big as California.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And so there's cities in both
the extraterrestrial caverns,

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and manufacturing
everything that you

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:44.860 align:middle line:90%
would need on a planet.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So then Hitler's group
did the same thing.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Four years before
the war was over,

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.610 align:middle line:84%
it was decided that the
war could possibly be lost.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:02.820 align:middle line:84%
But if we win it, we still
need to get out of the area.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Because the Allies are going
to bomb us off of the Earth

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and there won't be
anything here left for us.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to move
everything to Antarctica.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And we'll burn-- they're
going to go down there,

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to take out
the whole thing in one week.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:26.010 align:middle line:84%
The top people in
every area of the Navy,

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:30.300 align:middle line:84%
best aircraft, best of ships,
best weapons, everything.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And five weeks later, things
didn't look very good.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.050 align:middle line:84%
When we got down
there, they had decided

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.830 align:middle line:84%
they were going to have one
thrust from the west side

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
of Antarctica and then
the opposite side coming

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:50.290 align:middle line:84%
into both them towards the
center of the continent.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And so before we even
got all the guys around,

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about
these four engine

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:84%
flying boats and ships,
battleships and destroyers

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and submarines, and you name
it, before they got there,

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:16.830 align:middle line:84%
these fairly large-- they were
a hundred foot diameter saucers,

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:21.920 align:middle line:84%
came up out of the ocean
and took down everything.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a misnomer
on some documentations

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:84%
about the pictures, photographs
of some of the German UFOs.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Many of the closeups give
you a little clearer picture

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.910 align:middle line:90%
of the cross on them.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.230 align:middle line:10%
What was partially incorrect
and, in that information

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:10%
that's been released, was
that not all of the vehicles

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:54.280 align:middle line:10%
came up out from the German
side to take out ours,

00:30:54.280 --> 00:31:02.390 align:middle line:10%
but from the large caverns
adjacent to them, unmarked UFOs

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.860 align:middle line:10%
and unmarked cigars came up.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Which then, it was
a joint venture

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:84%
by the extraterrestrials
that lived there, operated

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.540 align:middle line:84%
from there, and built
the vehicles that

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:23.370 align:middle line:84%
went to the moon and Mars
and all these other places.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.440 align:middle line:90%
But we lost that war.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:90%
That was very impressive.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've heard about
this story over and over.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.050 align:middle line:84%
We know that Admiral Byrd
did return with his fleet.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.795 align:middle line:84%
But how much damage
was actually caused?

00:31:36.795 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my impression was that
they lost a substantial amount,

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:43.350 align:middle line:84%
like 20%, 30%,
somewhere in there.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:84%
They had an aircraft carrier,
I think, that was not sunk.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.510 align:middle line:90%
But they lost several ships.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a disaster from the
point of view of a Naval battle.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:01.070 align:middle line:84%
After this battle, he
talked about being attacked.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, he talked about being
able to fly from one pole

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:04.970 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And that was kind
of the only hint

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.350 align:middle line:84%
he gave that there might
have been advanced technology

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.150 align:middle line:90%
involved in this battle.

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Now do you still
believe they're there?

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.890 align:middle line:90%
Does he talk about that at all?

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:19.232 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
Germany still exists.

00:32:19.232 --> 00:32:20.690 align:middle line:84%
But with the
underground facilities

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:24.230 align:middle line:84%
there, are they still continuing
to work with the reptilian race

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:25.800 align:middle line:90%
down there?

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, Bill's position
before he died

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:32.770 align:middle line:84%
was that, yeah, the Nazis and
reptilians have a relationship

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:35.460 align:middle line:90%
that's in harmony.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And that that
relationship is in harmony

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of corporations
in this country who

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.660 align:middle line:84%
are getting money from the
government and all sorts

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:50.580 align:middle line:84%
of sources that they're
building secret space craft.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of those are being used
for evil purposes like slavery

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.270 align:middle line:90%
and mining other planets.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And others of them are
being used, for example,

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.090 align:middle line:84%
like the navy solar warden
program to kind of protect us

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:07.290 align:middle line:84%
from inappropriate attacks
by other alien races.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:12.840 align:middle line:84%
So there is a multitude
of goals and a multitude

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.590 align:middle line:84%
of responses and
capabilities that we have,

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.240 align:middle line:90%
all of which are secret.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Which is, as I said
earlier, is one

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.860 align:middle line:84%
of the things that has impressed
me so much in meeting Bill,

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:84%
is there's nothing that can't
be kept secret from the public.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, Bob.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
here and sharing

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.930 align:middle line:90%
all these amazing stories.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Emery Smith.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:38.520 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.570 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.720 align:middle line:90%
