00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.918 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:21.710 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Hi, I'm
here with John Lear.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking about
the underground world of Las

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.938 align:middle line:90%
Vegas.

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:26.480 align:middle line:84%
John, how are you
doing this morning?

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN LEAR: Real good,
Emery nice to see you.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So tell me
about this test site.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:10%
>>LEAR: You know, this story,
Emery, starts back in 1980 when

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:10%
I was flying for the Department
of Energy North American OV-10.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was told they were
going to get me a Q clearance.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, the Q clearance
is pretty high clearance.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And I can't-- I didn't
understand why I would have

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:90%
to have one.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was nice to get one.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: But the
paperwork was massive

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.008 align:middle line:84%
because I had to
account for every time I

00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:90%
flew in and out of the country.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And my application was six
pages single type, you know,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:90%
entries and exits.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And it took 18 months
to get the clearance.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the reason I needed
the clearance is they

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
were upgrading the security
for the entire test site.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So even although I flew
over the new places,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:84%
my job was to give them
the winds from ground level

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.290 align:middle line:84%
at 10,000 feet before they
shot the test so that they

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:84%
would see that if it
vented, it wouldn't

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.232 align:middle line:90%
be going towards Vegas.

00:01:26.232 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What were
they actually testing?

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Nuke.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.350 align:middle line:84%
They were testing an
underground nukes.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
But what that did is
it gave me a chance

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
to look around and
see what was going on.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see into
Groom Lake or anything

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:84%
like that, but to
the north of where

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I was flying in the the
Pahute Mesa, Rainier mesa.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, as it started
to get finalized,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I heard through
several contacts that I

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:84%
had that the Sandia was going
to need 2,000 people a day.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
That meant they were going
to have to take 2,000 people

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.642 align:middle line:84%
and take them up to
Sandia on the Pahute Mesa

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and bring them back
in the evening.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Now that's a lot of people.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't do it--

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:84%
we could do with airplanes, but
they wanted to do it secret.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want anybody
to know what was going on.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't get
Special Projects,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
which ran the Boeing
737, get a bunch more 737

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:84%
because that would
have alerted somebody

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:90%
that something was going on.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to build an
underground secret maglev

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.440 align:middle line:90%
subway.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You did
mention Pahute Mesa.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But you also mentioned Sandia,
which is in New Mexico.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people
to be confused

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
What they-- they, the
secret government--

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:84%
started to do in the 80's
was name secret projects

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
with names that were common
so that, you know, we

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:90%
had the secret--

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.027 align:middle line:84%
we had the Sandia laboratories,
Sandia mountain range.

00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Manzanas.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And so if they named the new
secret base Sandia, if it

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.217 align:middle line:90%
got accidentally mentioned--

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: People would
think it's over there.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Exactly.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.462 align:middle line:84%
They had to get
2,000 of them started

00:03:08.462 --> 00:03:10.548 align:middle line:90%
to build the maglev subway.

00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And they needed-- as you
know, when you build a subway,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:90%
you don't start underground.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:84%
You start at the
top and work down.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So they needed about
70 acres of an empty lot

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
where they could dig
down on the strip.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: On-- how
did they hide that?

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Well,
they-- first of all,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:84%
they used the area of
the Stardust Casino

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:90%
which had been demolished.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:90%
And that area was free.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:90%
It was just an empty lot.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:90%
They were trying to sell it.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the major casino
that was in operation

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:84%
of this whole underground
massive effort

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:90%
bought that empty lot.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.772 align:middle line:84%
But it was right on
Las Vegas Boulevard,

00:03:55.772 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:90%
so they had to hide it.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So what they did is they
built a fake casino.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.060 align:middle line:90%
And that was called Echelon.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And they told
everybody in the press

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:84%
they were going to
build this great casino.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:90%
And they put up the framework.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:90%
But it was really just to hide--

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, to hide.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: --the operation--

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: --from Las
Vegas Boulevard,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.797 align:middle line:84%
and industrial on the West
Side, and Desert Inn Road.

00:04:19.797 --> 00:04:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, I understand.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So fortunately, somebody
had taken aerial pictures

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:90%
of this operation.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So when I put this
on Facebook, I

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:84%
had pictures of
that huge equipment,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
you know, right there
in that empty lot.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And the holes, the
tunnels going down in.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And we're
talking huge equipment.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.140 align:middle line:84%
The audience needs to
know these are very large.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So I had a friend that
worked on this fake casino.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that they
were briefed every morning.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Every morning.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Do not look over the
side because if you do,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:84%
we have CIA sharpshooters
with highly accurate rifles

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.702 align:middle line:90%
that will kill you instantly.

00:05:05.702 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were pretty
open about it.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Don't look.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how
this managed with OSHA.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, if they
had a hard hat on.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a Kevlar helmet on.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So they were all
briefed on this.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And it took, I think, a year
before they got this finished.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But what they did is they
dug down, and then went up

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:90%
to the Luxor.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is all, like,
100 feet underground.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:84%
The reason they used the
Luxor was because number one,

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.500 align:middle line:84%
the Luxor provided a place that
they could take an elevator

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and go down to the terminal for
the beginning of the subway.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: To get over.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: But it was also
directly across the street

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:90%
from Special Projects.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Now Special Projects has been
around for, you know, 40 years.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And their job is to
transport workers

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
in Las Vegas up to Groom Lake
and to Tonopah test range.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And they had that brand
new base-looking terminal

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:84%
on the northwest
side of McCarran.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they
parked their six Boeing

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:84%
737, and their Beechcraft,
and all their other aircraft.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So what they have is an
elevator that goes down

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and a moving sidewalk
that takes the people that

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
are authorized to use the
subway under the Luxor.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Now from the Luxor, it
goes to the Bellagio

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:84%
where there's another
huge terminal.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason they
used the Bellagio

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:84%
is the Bellagio already
had underground parking

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:84%
for their customers
already built.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And this was perfect for
the thousands of people

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:90%
that they had to hide.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And all they did was
tunnel to the terminal.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.770 align:middle line:10%
So if you go on the web and
type in power failure 2004,

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:10%
you will see that when they
were enlarging the terminal

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:10%
under the Bellagio,
they accidentally

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:10%
hit the major power
grid for the Bellagio

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.880 align:middle line:10%
and knocked out the
power for three days.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Now as you know,
Emery, when they

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
build a casino, one thing they
plan for is to never ever,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:84%
ever lose any power
because they've

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
got millions of dollars going
across to tables every second.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And this knocked out the
power for three days.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
It was a massive intelligence
failure because of the fact

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:84%
now they had to get help to
get this power grid back on.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.558 align:middle line:84%
And they had to tell
Nevada Power, which

00:07:24.558 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:90%
was what they were called then.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Not called Nevada Energy.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
They had to get those
guys out and tell them

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.170 align:middle line:84%
what was going on, which
means they had to sign NDAs,

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
nondisclosure agreements, where,
you know, the 12 or 15 people

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that they needed to get
this back into operation.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.080 align:middle line:90%
It was a massive--

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's a cluster.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: --massive screw up.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know how they
dealt with the owners

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:84%
of the Bellagio, who then
it was Steve Williams.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm sure they would
have to compensate them.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Or how they told them.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
But in the newspaper,
you can see

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
that it says the power
failure was never explained.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:84%
I thought that
that was hilarious.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Never explained.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
So from the Bellagio,
it goes direct to--

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:90%
went direct to Sandia.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And then they had another
one that went to Groom Lake.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's all over.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:84%
They have all these
massive subways

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:90%
under the entire test site.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Now the trip from Bellagio
to Sandia takes 21 minutes.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's about 300 miles an hour.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 300 miles an hour.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
John, we have a map here of
the underground maglev tube

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:90%
system coming out of Las Vegas.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.187 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain
this map to me?

00:08:33.187 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah, Emery.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Right here is Las Vegas
where the terminus is.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.122 align:middle line:84%
The original terminal
is under the Luxor.

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's
under the Luxor

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%
is it's right across the
street from special projects.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And those people
who are authorized

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.010 align:middle line:84%
from special projects take an
underground moving sidewalk

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:90%
to the terminal at the Luxor.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.623 align:middle line:84%
From the Luxor, it
goes to the Bellagio.

00:08:56.623 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Bellagio-- the
reason they use the Bellagio,

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.940 align:middle line:84%
the Bellagio already had
underground parking which they

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:84%
could use to get the
2,000 people up to--

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Brilliant.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And made a tunnel from
the underground parking

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:90%
to the Bellagio terminal.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:84%
From the Bellagio, it
goes up to Pahute Mesa.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, right there.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.430 align:middle line:90%
No, to your left.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:90%
That's Pahute Mesa.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
new secret base is.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.277 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they need 2,000
people a day up and back.

00:09:27.277 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that's why they
nicknamed it Sandia to kind

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:90%
of disinform people.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Exactly.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Now over to the
right, you see Groom Lake.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And they decided to make
another terminal there.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:90%
Up here is Coyote Springs.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.527 align:middle line:84%
That's a secret
underground base.

00:09:44.527 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are
they doing up there?

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: We don't know.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.570 align:middle line:84%
But I had a friend wanted to
know exactly where it was.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And he got a job as
a flight attendant

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.910 align:middle line:84%
with Key Airlines who
ran the subcontract.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.550 align:middle line:90%
And he saw where it was.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:90%
But he was-- he won't tell me.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:90%
But he told me-- said, yeah.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:90%
He said it's there.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:84%
When the people get
out of the air--

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:84%
that lands right in the
middle of the desert.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: There's nothing there.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said when the people go
down the stairs at this place,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
he said there's a little sand
dune maybe eight feet high.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And they used to walk behind
this thing and disappear.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.938 align:middle line:84%
So that's obviously
where the stairway goes.

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they making
them wear those glasses?

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Some of the employees--

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Not there.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Not there.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Because all they have
to do is walk over the sand

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and there's no indication.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
This is about 10, 15 miles
to the West of Panaca.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:90%
And up here is where Panaca--

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and there's another
city out there.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you drive up there and
try and get into that dry lake

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
area, there's fences and guards
that won't let you go in there.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Now the other line that
goes to the Northwest

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.232 align:middle line:84%
there goes up to the
Tonopah test range.

00:11:02.232 --> 00:11:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, Tonopah.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they
have the big elevator

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
on the dry lake that goes
down maybe 15 stories.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.645 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And that's where
they hide all their flying

00:11:15.645 --> 00:11:18.101 align:middle line:84%
saucers that we
have that are ours

00:11:18.101 --> 00:11:21.130 align:middle line:90%
that use our anti-grav stuff.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And that area is hundreds
of acres under there.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:30.380 align:middle line:84%
For the last six years, Google
has not changed that picture.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And just last summer,
they put the new picture.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And right in the
middle of the dry lake,

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.680 align:middle line:90%
there's a perfect circle.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's not hidden at all.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:84%
This secret government
is so arrogant,

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
they don't care
whether people see

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.145 align:middle line:90%
this elevator ready to go down.

00:11:47.145 --> 00:11:49.520 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they figure
people won't believe it anyway.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So why bother to
try and conceal it?

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Then up to the top there is the
assembly goes to Ferber Flats.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:03.320 align:middle line:84%
That's 44 miles south
of Wendover, Utah.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's the big
airbase where they

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.590 align:middle line:90%
fly the black triangles out of.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's hidden by
a holographic image.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
project a holographic image

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.420 align:middle line:84%
over the airport that
makes it look like desert

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:90%
or wherever it is.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:84%
If it's in a forest,
it looks like a forest.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Pilots flying in there
are radar vectored

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.160 align:middle line:90%
onto final at about 200 feet.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.582 align:middle line:84%
They turn the image off
so he can see the lights.

00:12:30.582 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: See what's going on.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: He lands.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And then they turn
the image back on.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Now the people
that work up there

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
are told that it's
done with mirrors.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:84%
They want to keep this
holographic image secret.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: So they're--

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where did you
get that intel from?

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: From somebody
who worked up there.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Have you been up there?

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: No, I have not.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you been
to Sandia or Dreamland?

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Sandia, no.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Dreamland, I told you I went
there in 1977 to take pictures.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:90%
And I've been to several areas.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.910 align:middle line:84%
You can see that one area
up there that says Ely.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, Ely.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: A friend of mine used
to drive that twice a week.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And every time he would go
by 10 miles south of Ely,

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:84%
always 2:00 in the morning,
he would occasionally

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
see runway lights
about 10,000 feet long.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.623 align:middle line:90%
Blue, a secret military color.

00:13:25.623 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And he never figured
out what was there.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:84%
He never had time
to drive over there.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So there is a strip up
there for something.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.583 align:middle line:84%
But we never did
find out what it was.

00:13:34.583 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do they
keep the restricted areas

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:84%
up there by Utah at the
farthest base up there?

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:47.400 align:middle line:84%
You know how it's not only
airspace and it's not on land.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: They keep the intact--

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.380 align:middle line:90%
the original restricted areas.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: But to extend it, they
used MOAs, military operating

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:84%
areas, to hide the secret
strip at Ferber Flats.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was right in the paper.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And it showed a
map and everything.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
we need more area

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:90%
for our F16s to practice.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:90%
Ha!

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Not likely.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But didn't it belong
to a US citizen or rancher

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:90%
probably, or somebody?

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Some of the land up there
before it was taken over?

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:90%
Or was it BLM lab?

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: I'm sure that was all
BLM because they issued hunting

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:90%
certificates for that area.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.557 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
originally found

00:14:26.557 --> 00:14:30.210 align:middle line:84%
it is one hunter
was tracked by SUVs.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, he was experienced
with his time in Vietnam

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
escaping invasion to
get rid of these--

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, evade
these white SUVs

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:90%
which were guarding the base.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.542 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
the Hoover Dam, John?

00:14:43.542 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about that?

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Well, that's
where area 51 originally

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.940 align:middle line:90%
got all their power.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And now
I think they have

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:84%
their own nuclear
generator up there.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't have absolute
confirmation of it.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:84%
But I'm pretty sure
that's what they have.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.520 align:middle line:84%
But the original power
came from Hoover Dam.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.992 align:middle line:90%
A massive draw of power.

00:15:05.992 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah,
that's what I heard.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
I used to do some
military ops there

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:84%
when I was stationed in
Kirtland Air Force Base

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:18.040 align:middle line:84%
just in case there was a
terrorist attack on that area.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.150 align:middle line:90%
So there was always--

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:84%
there was always a
military presence there.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And some of the guys
and security guards

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:84%
told me that there's actually
big areas dug into the mountain

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.300 align:middle line:90%
and underneath it.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.017 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That they were
doing some things that

00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:90%
were clandestine.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Now just to the north
of Hoover Dam right

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
here, is the secret new Lime
Canyon helicopter base, which

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:90%
they started to build in 2006.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Now I wouldn't have been
aware of this, except my--

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:84%
the gold mine I was
trying to resurrect

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:90%
was right there at Gold Butte.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And in 2006, I heard
dynamite going off.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: I was the only one that
I was authorized or licensed

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.370 align:middle line:84%
to have dynamite, so
I couldn't understand

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:90%
who else was using dynamite.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:84%
It turned out that where they
were building the helicopter

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:07.660 align:middle line:90%
base right there.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:13.560 align:middle line:84%
About this time, we had a ranger
patrolling the Gold Butte area

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:84%
who found a brand new
case of dynamite current--

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
had just fallen
out of a helicopter

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
apparently-- that
they were using

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:90%
to build that helicopter base.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And that helicopter base was
operational in 2008 or 2009

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:90%
along the Lime Canyon ridge.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't been
able to find it.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well, I'll be.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.610 align:middle line:90%
And who's running that facility?

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:42.675 align:middle line:84%
Is that corporation
based military guarded?

00:16:42.675 --> 00:16:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: It's the
same people that

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.810 align:middle line:84%
are operating the secret
helicopter base that's

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:90%
just north of Nellis.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:90%
It's over that range.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
work up in that area

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
say they see the helicopters
coming up and over that range,

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.598 align:middle line:90%
but nowhere to come from.

00:16:58.598 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're just
coming out of the mountain.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: They just come
right out of the ground.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.519 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And you want to
explain how these maglev systems

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:08.319 align:middle line:90%
actually work?

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.763 align:middle line:90%
The electromagnetic ones.

00:17:09.763 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: You know, I don't
know exactly, Emery.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:84%
I've just heard, you
know, for years of maglev.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.779 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
form of a vacuum.

00:17:17.779 --> 00:17:18.579 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Vacuum.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.536 align:middle line:84%
They actually use
both at the same time.

00:17:20.536 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Oh, they do?

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:22.119 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:23.786 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: When I
originally got into this,

00:17:23.786 --> 00:17:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I heard about the
Navy transportation

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:34.340 align:middle line:84%
system, which started at the
submarine base in San Diego.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And the Navy people
who would ride,

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.843 align:middle line:84%
they said these were like
cars that only had one person.

00:17:41.843 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:90%
And you would get in there--

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: --lay back,
and they they'd

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:84%
take off your watch, and
your jewelry, and everything.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And within minutes,
you'd be in North Dakota.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And they never figured
out how that worked.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And they also go all the
way around the world.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
time I heard of that.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And then we started
hearing about, you know,

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
those type of transportation
going to Pine Gap.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Pine Gap.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: People would be
at Groom Lake, and then

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
a couple of minutes
later being at Pine Gap.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:90%
How did they do that?

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We're talking about
2,000 people going out here,

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:84%
you know, or more
a day, of course.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting here
by these maglev trains

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:90%
and being flown in.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Does these maglev
trains, you know, hold--

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.335 align:middle line:84%
what's the maximum capacity
have you heard of this?

00:18:31.335 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: I don't know.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
any-- really heard

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:84%
from anybody that actually
rode on them that will tell me.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's got to be at
least 200 people per car

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.310 align:middle line:84%
for the transportation
because you're

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.810 align:middle line:90%
talking about 2,000 people.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.167 align:middle line:84%
Have to get them up
there within two hours.

00:18:50.167 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right, it's either
traveling really fast,

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
or they have a very long tube
system along a train there.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the single ones
that you have talked about.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.370 align:middle line:90%
These capsules.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And I have
witnessed the long train.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But I've never
actually rode in that.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I've rode in a
smaller versions that

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.995 align:middle line:90%
hold maybe four to 10 people.

00:19:10.995 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Exactly how you say
where you lay down.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.930 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
off all your stuff.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're still using
the old technology

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:84%
back in the early 90's is
what I'm talking about.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm sure it's
a little bit more

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:84%
advanced of what they have
to get all these employees up

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.718 align:middle line:84%
So when they built that massive
construction of the West

00:19:31.718 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Wing of the White
House, people said,

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle line:84%
well, it must be for 74
megaton bomb protect.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:90%
No, it wasn't.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Terminal?

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: What they were doing
was accessing the White House

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
with the underground
transportation.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
went down 60 feet.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So not everybody
in the White House

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:84%
is authorized to know
about that transportation.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the
president is because he

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.730 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have enough clearance.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And the way clearances
work is top secret

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:90%
is the lowest clearance.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:10%
And then above that,
there's 38 levels.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:10%
There's 28 levels of
top secret crypto.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.010 align:middle line:10%
And then 10 names
above that, which

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:10%
is Ultra all the
way to Majestic,

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:10%
which is a top clearance.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.060 align:middle line:10%
So the president of the
United States, you know,

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:10%
he doesn't have
very high clearance.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.430 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't need to know.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.470 align:middle line:10%
He's only in office for
a maximum of eight years.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And it takes
long-- you know, very long

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.322 align:middle line:84%
time to vet him for
these clearances.

00:20:22.322 --> 00:20:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So he might have
top secret crypto

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.920 align:middle line:84%
17, which would allow
him to know some stuff.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:84%
But when you get a clearance
of, say, top secret--

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:90%
top secret crypto 17--

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.050 align:middle line:84%
you don't get to know
everything in that level.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:84%
All you get to know
is what you work on.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.388 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that was kind
of my situation.

00:20:42.388 --> 00:20:43.346 align:middle line:90%
I had a different code.

00:20:43.346 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
It was just A22 with
working on the devices

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:90%
and also working on the beams.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And also, not knowing
where I'm going,

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.150 align:middle line:84%
but we're escorting
you to this place,

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:55.910 align:middle line:90%
you know, through this maglev.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And within 30 minutes, I
don't know where I was.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.820 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't tell me, you know,
because I'm not there to know.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm just there to be escorted
to look at this craft.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:05.865 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that's
it, you know?

00:21:05.865 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was kept very
compartmentalized.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until later on
getting out of the military

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:84%
and kept doing some contract
work where I actually started

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.410 align:middle line:90%
getting more clearances.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
faster that I

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.340 align:middle line:90%
wasn't active duty at the time.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.950 align:middle line:90%
So, John, what is the--

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you had Q clearance.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain,
like, what level

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:90%
that is on the totem pole?

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Q clearance is a
clearance they give civilians.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's equal to military
top secret clearance.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Top secret is the lowest
clearance you can get.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And the Q clearance
is equivalent to that.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
everybody has to have

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:84%
if they even sweep the
floors up at the Groom Lake.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Above Q, I don't
know what they call it.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Above top secret is the
top secret crypto to 28,

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and then the 10
names above that.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.675 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And do you
know any of these--

00:21:56.675 --> 00:22:01.645 align:middle line:84%
of some of the higher
Echelon crypto guys?

00:22:01.645 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Balthazar
is the only one

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:90%
that I know that had Majestic.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to
get his clearance elevated

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:90%
as quickly as possible.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:84%
He was only up there
for four months.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And when he would be
taken into his room

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:84%
to read these briefings, you
know, there was 150 of them

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.218 align:middle line:90%
with a blue front.

00:22:21.218 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
piled there and he

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.310 align:middle line:90%
could read any one he wanted.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And it covered all the aspects
of the secret operations

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.320 align:middle line:90%
that were going on.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you have a
list of that Majestic group

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that was released
a few years back?

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:90%
The majestic group?

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.037 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Yeah, on my
computer I do have one.

00:22:41.037 --> 00:22:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you know-- did
you recognize any other name

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:44.180 align:middle line:90%
on there?

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yes, Vandenberg--

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: --was one of them.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And he had a romantic
attachment to my mother.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, wow.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, tell us about that, John.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.470 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.745 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: You know, I was--

00:22:58.745 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
you know, that would
have been in '54, '55.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:90%
I would have been 13 or 14.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Know nothing about that.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.440 align:middle line:84%
All I knew was that Jimmy
Doolittle was over at the house

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And we lived at 222 14th
Street in Santa Monica.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And Jimmy Doolittle
lived on Third Street--

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.910 align:middle line:90%
he and his wife Jo.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Jimmy Doolittle was good
friends with my grandfather

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:84%
who was Ollie Olson of
Olsen and Johnson, a very

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.220 align:middle line:90%
famous Vaudeville team.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.580 align:middle line:84%
They had Hell's A Poppin', which
was the longest running show

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.370 align:middle line:90%
on Broadway in those days.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And friends with
Jimmy Doolittle, which

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:90%
made him friends of my father.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And they used to be over
at the house all the time,

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:46.400 align:middle line:84%
along with Vandenberg, as I
told you, had a crush on my mom.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very close
relationship through the years.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And then when Doolittle's wife
passed away, Jo passed away,

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.570 align:middle line:84%
he moved up to
Carmel, California.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Retired there.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:84%
He was a member of the
QB organization up there.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.040 align:middle line:90%
What was he famous for?

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Jimmy Doolittle?

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Jimmy Doolittle was
famous for the raid on Japan.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:84%
They had the B-25s that took
off from the aircraft carrier

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:90%
and actually bombed Japan.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And this was in response
to Japan's attack on us

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:90%
on Pearl Harbor.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.245 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And they
were successful.

00:24:26.245 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it didn't
cause much damage.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:84%
but it was mostly
a newsworthy thing

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.620 align:middle line:84%
that we're getting
back at Japan.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And then after the
war, Jimmy Doolittle

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:90%
was a executive with Shell Oil.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And he used that position to
go to the different places

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:84%
where the UFO crashes were
ostensibly to be for Shell Oil.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.380 align:middle line:90%
But really, he was a member.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.485 align:middle line:84%
Now he wasn't a member of MJ-12,
but he was right at the top.

00:24:51.485 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: He was
right at the top.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So when Bill Moore
Eisenhower briefing came out

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:07.060 align:middle line:84%
from the 35 millimeter photos
of the Eisenhower briefing,

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I had to find out if
MJ-12 was real or not.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if it was real, that
means everything else is real.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:10%
The Eisenhower briefing
was a 12-page briefing

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:10%
for President
Eisenhower for when

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:23.470 align:middle line:10%
he was elected as President
of the United States in 1952.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And this gave him an
overview of extraterrestrials

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:90%
and flying saucers.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And it told about the
recovery of Roswell

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:84%
along with four or five
other crises and recoveries.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:10%
It gave a list of
the members of MJ-12

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.740 align:middle line:10%
and what their background was.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.458 align:middle line:84%
There was a number
of addendums--

00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Additions, yeah.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: --additions
to this document.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was just listed
as their number, and--

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.000 align:middle line:90%
it could retrieve them.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.600 align:middle line:84%
When I saw this document, a lot
of this stuff was blacked out.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Blacked out, yes.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: But I realized
that MJ-12 was the key.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And I knew by that time
that Jimmy Doolittle

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.640 align:middle line:90%
was at the very top.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And I also knew that my mom
talked to him every month.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:10.840 align:middle line:90%
She lived in Reno.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.380 align:middle line:84%
He was retired and
lived in Carmel.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And I started a--

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would take
advantage of this relationship

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and ask my mom to ask
Jimmy if MJ-12 was real.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Now it took about
four months for that

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:27.100 align:middle line:84%
to happen because, first of
all, I had to get her convinced

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.270 align:middle line:84%
that it was important enough
for her to ask Jimmy that.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we had to
wait until he called

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
so it wouldn't look like she
was calling for the information.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.310 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, it did happen.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:90%
She asked the question.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, yes, Moya, it is, but
I can't say anything about it.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And when she told me that,
that was the beginning for me

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:84%
of the more total immersion
into the UFO investigation.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What is their agenda?

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:57.890 align:middle line:84%
What are they-- like, what do
you think is going on there?

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:58.810 align:middle line:90%
What's your opinion?

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: You know, Emery,
when Bob got his--

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Balthazar got his original
Majestic clearance,

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.970 align:middle line:84%
he was told that it
was only 22 people.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And he was given a list of
the names of the 22 people

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.310 align:middle line:90%
that had Majestic at that time.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:15.550 align:middle line:84%
At that level of clearance,
that's when you find out

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.770 align:middle line:90%
there is no God.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:90%
And there was no Jesus.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.970 align:middle line:90%
There was no Mary Magdalene.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what that
Majestic clearance

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.880 align:middle line:84%
is because when you get
that level of knowledge,

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:90%
you have to know the truth.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is,
there was no God.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Now there certainly is
gods of the universe.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:90%
Plenty of them.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: But not as we envision.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Right, it's been
misconstrued in a program.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And When you
get to Majestic level,

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.380 align:middle line:90%
you have to know the truth.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: John, what's the
knowledge level in Majestic

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:51.940 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.710 align:middle line:84%
What are they doing on a daily
basis since they know so much?

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Well, Emery,
obviously, that

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:84%
would be pure speculation
because I don't

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:90%
have anywhere near Majestic.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But the things that
we've talked about

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
is what they know-- they
are authorized to know.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And I have the same problem
that you do, is when we know--

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.440 align:middle line:84%
you and I know
the truth, talking

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.220 align:middle line:84%
about the stuff we do is
just impossible for people

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to believe some of
the things we say.

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult.
So I would only

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.900 align:middle line:84%
speculate that they know
the truth about religion.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:33.990 align:middle line:84%
They know the truth about
who made us and why.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.973 align:middle line:84%
You know, all that
kind of stuff.

00:28:35.973 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you
have any knowledge

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.630 align:middle line:84%
of Majestic having
extraterrestrial communication

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:41.980 align:middle line:90%
or assistance?

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Absolutely.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.750 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
that essentially

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.770 align:middle line:90%
manage the agreement with ET.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And the agreement is you
can have all this cool stuff

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.580 align:middle line:84%
that we're giving
to you, but you

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:90%
can't let the public have it.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can't let them
know that we exist.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say the
disclosure will never,

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:05.260 align:middle line:84%
ever happen because they
cannot tell the truth.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And they made an agreement
not to tell the truth.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why were these
individuals picked for this?

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:84%
How did they-- it's just
their-- is this their life

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:17.510 align:middle line:84%
path and they wound up like you
and I, where we're at today?

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: I can only
speculate, Emery.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, they were in the
right place at the right time.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think there
is some sort of voting system

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.370 align:middle line:84%
in Majestic that they say, well,
this guy needs to be on board,

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:33.490 align:middle line:84%
this guy does not
need to be on board?

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yes.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
original Majestic 12

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:84%
were all military
and scientific.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And then as they started
to pass away, die off,

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:90%
it became political.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And then it didn't matter
whether the director of the CIA

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:57.850 align:middle line:84%
needed to know, they gave
him an MJ-12 number and--

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:90%
or an MJ number.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that wasn't
the right thing to do.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There was 12 beginning
founders of the Majestic group.

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Do you know now if there's
more than that in there?

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Supposedly there's more.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.482 align:middle line:90%
Supposedly there's 20 or 30.

00:30:15.482 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's what I heard.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: But I don't
know that for a fact.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I know that the last original
Majestic member died in 1982.

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
reason that they

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.640 align:middle line:84%
were able to start the release
of the information, which

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.425 align:middle line:84%
included the
Eisenhower briefing.

00:30:32.425 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who else has
a clearance that you're

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.370 align:middle line:90%
aware of with Majestic?

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Would be former
Vice President Dick Cheney.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:10%
He held a very high position
within the secret government.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So high that several
years ago, they

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:52.180 align:middle line:84%
built access to the underground
transportation under his house.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And there was huge
tarps all over that

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.050 align:middle line:84%
the neighbors were
complaining about.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.425 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
they were digging

00:30:58.425 --> 00:31:01.450 align:middle line:84%
down so that he didn't have
to go anywhere other than go

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:03.980 align:middle line:84%
downstairs in his house to
access the transportation

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.780 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, we went over
all these amazing maps.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.795 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, there's--

00:31:10.795 --> 00:31:13.420 align:middle line:84%
this is-- you know, this
is worldwide going on.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:84%
This maglev system and
this vacuum tube system.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.640 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about the cities.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, are you aware of
some of these larger cities

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:26.290 align:middle line:84%
built, you know, not only at the
facilities, but other places?

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Massive.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Under every American city, there
is another city under there.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And we know that only for
people who've been there.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.780 align:middle line:84%
But from truck
drivers who deliver

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.630 align:middle line:84%
massive amounts of
foods and other stuff

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:46.630 align:middle line:84%
to secret underground tunnels
or tunnels inside a mountain

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.320 align:middle line:90%
to keep these things stored.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Now the secret
government is obviously

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.610 align:middle line:84%
preparing for something
that we don't know about.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.662 align:middle line:84%
That's why those
cities are there.

00:31:56.662 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they're preparing

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.060 align:middle line:84%
or when it's going to happen,
but they think that something's

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.090 align:middle line:90%
going to happen.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well, that's obvious.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's
not going to happen,

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.853 align:middle line:84%
they're always going to be
spending money and preparing

00:32:09.853 --> 00:32:11.270 align:middle line:84%
because the more
money they spend,

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.360 align:middle line:84%
the more money they make
that they put on the side.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And the "Nation"
magazine in December

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:21.730 align:middle line:84%
estimated that their total
take for the last 20 years

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.953 align:middle line:90%
was $22 trillion.

00:32:24.953 --> 00:32:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I believe it.

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:84%
John, that was a very
interesting instruction.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:34.460 align:middle line:84%
From Las Vegas to talking
about these underground maglev

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.780 align:middle line:84%
tubes and other train systems
that stretch around the world.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, John, so much
for explaining all that.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:42.690 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you soon.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: My pleasure, Emery.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:55.723 align:middle line:90%
