>>EMERY SMITH: Jason Shurka
is a real estate entrepreneur

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.100 align:middle line:10%
and author who has recently
been tasked to speak publicly

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.080 align:middle line:10%
about the clandestine
organization

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:10%
with extraterrestrial
connections that he says

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:10%
has secretly existed on this
planet for thousands of years.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Jason, welcome to
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON SHURKA: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is TLS,
and what's its mission?

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SHURKA: Sure.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So TLS, first of
all, those letters

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:90%
stand for The Light System.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:90%
That's what they stand for.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.583 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The Light System.

00:00:46.583 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SHURKA: Yes.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a little bit of
structure of how they work.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:90%
They're a global--

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, worldwide--
organization,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I would even say
universal-wide organization.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many
members are there?

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: There are
7,000 initiated agents.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.840 align:middle line:84%
When I say initiated,
there's a certain process

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
that you go through to
become an initiated agent

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:90%
into the actual organization.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:84%
There came a point
in June of 2018

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:84%
where I was approached
by somebody.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:84%
At that point, it
was a stranger.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And when he approached me in
just a regular conversation--

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I like your necklace,
what is it--

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:90%
he knew exactly who I was.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that at the time.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Over time, he started sharing
more and more information

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:84%
with me and putting me through
this disclosure process,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:84%
we could call it, as I was
prepared to receive it.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So it started with more so
metaphysical conversations

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.530 align:middle line:84%
of, really, anything--
the fundamental base

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and how things
work on the energetic level

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:84%
all the way to
extraterrestrial races

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and their levels of awareness
and their technology

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and many, many different
things-- very wide

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
sort of array of
topics and subjects.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:84%
There came a point where
he revealed his affiliation

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:84%
with a specific
organization known as TLS.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:90%
We're going to call him Ray.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
That's his pseudo
name that he chose.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
reason that he doesn't

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
want to come out and tell
the world who he is is he

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
has a very distinguished
cover in the world.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Nobody actually knows who he is.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:90%
He's a pretty prominent person.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows him for his
cover and not who he is.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:90%
He's an older man.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And for him to come
out and say, hey,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:84%
this is what I actually do--
because he works with TLS--

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:84%
for him to come and say that
would be a complete change

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:90%
of his entire life overnight.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, it's
just not something

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:90%
that he wants right now.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So why do you think
they picked you specifically

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.005 align:middle line:90%
to deliver this message?

00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: So originally,
at least to my knowledge,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't supposed to be the one
to put out this information.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.630 align:middle line:84%
There is a book written
called "Rays of Light"

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
that was written and more
so documented by Ray.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.370 align:middle line:10%
It's like a
consolidation of a bunch

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.460 align:middle line:10%
of different conversations,
dialogues, lectures, insights,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:10%
knowledge, information, that
Ray accumulated over the period

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:10%
of 2010 to 2014.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
What happened was
TLS, at that point,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
gave him permission
to put it out.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Ray actually did say that he's
willing to publish the book

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
contingent on the fact that he
can reveal the codes to unlock

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:90%
the book's power.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:84%
TLS does not allow
him to do that,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.555 align:middle line:84%
partly because they feel
that humanity is not

00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:24.805 align:middle line:90%
ready for something like that.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to agree
with them on that aspect.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.595 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So tell me
about the mission of TLS.

00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: Yes, so their overall
mission, the reason why they're

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:84%
here today, is to help
assist and guide humanity

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
in reaching a higher level of
awareness, specifically gamma.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Gamma is referred to
what many people call

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:90%
fifth-dimensional awareness.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.210 align:middle line:90%
That's what gamma is.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:84%
That's this new
era, this new age,

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.720 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to assist
and guide us into reaching.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, everybody-- agent, no
agent, just every human being--

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
is born with a specific
frequency, a specific energy.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So there is, as I was taught,
10 different dimensions

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
is made out of.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Each dimension is
infinite, but there's

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:90%
10 different dimensions.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
The name of the first five
is what modern-day science

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.480 align:middle line:84%
calls brainwave frequencies,
or brainwave patterns.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:84%
So that's beta, alpha,
theta, delta, and gamma.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.567 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those
frequencies are actually

00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
different dimensions
on the spiritual level,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:84%
only science is more focused on
the physical phenomenon instead

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
of the non-physical,
so they keep it

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:90%
limited to that understanding.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
These frequencies are all
different dimensions and levels

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
of awareness that, when
you're in resonance with them,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:84%
allows you to do
different things.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, most
of the human race

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:90%
today is in mid-beta.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Each dimension is
broken up into 10 parts.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's beta 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, delta 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10,

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.690 align:middle line:90%
all that, and gamma and so on.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: For example,
anywhere from beta to alpha

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:84%
is more materialistic,
very preoccupied

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:84%
with the material
aspects of life.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Theta is-- I'll give you some
examples-- more somebody that's

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
more preoccupied with the
spiritual aspect of life--

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.160 align:middle line:90%
They generally read a lot more.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
The way they eat is a
little bit different.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
It's more correlated to
higher vibrational foods.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Delta gives the
ability to do things

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.640 align:middle line:90%
like out-of-body experiences.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And gamma is when all
of this is just not

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.380 align:middle line:84%
a problem for you-- levitation
with the body, flight

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:90%
with the body.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
are second nature.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
TLS, I mean, you

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
could think of them as like a
spiritual version of the CIA

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.535 align:middle line:84%
because that's pretty
much how they're built,

00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
organizationally speaking, only
they're a lot more powerful.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.640 align:middle line:84%
People that have the abilities
to levitate with the body,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.770 align:middle line:84%
fly with the body,
all of those things

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:84%
are part of humans
and non-humans

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:90%
that are a part of TLS.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.645 align:middle line:84%
When I say non-humans, there
are extraterrestrial beings--

00:05:57.645 --> 00:06:00.020 align:middle line:84%
physical beings that you could
touch, that you can smell,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:90%
that you can hug--

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:90%
that are a part of TLS.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Some of them look like us.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Some of them don't.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, over time, shift
into looking like a human being

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:90%
to assimilate into Earth.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Also, in TLS, when it
comes to their structure,

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
explain that, they

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.160 align:middle line:84%
have a branch in every
major city in the world.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Each branch, or division,
is referred to as a chapter.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So in New York, let's say,
their main New York branch

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:84%
would be called their
New York chapter.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.852 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes
to TLS, as well, it

00:06:32.852 --> 00:06:34.310 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do
with religion, it

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do with race
or age or gender or ethnicity

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.060 align:middle line:90%
or any of that.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:90%
There's all ages, all ranges.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.030 align:middle line:84%
There are very old people who
are part of the organization.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
I know of two--

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:84%
one is over 400 years old,
another one is 613 years old,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:90%
if I'm not mistaken.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:90%
And they're human beings.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
They're very powerful human
beings that have access

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:90%
to very high dimensions.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
They're in a state of
gamma at all times.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:84%
These people are not people
that you would know exist.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't want
to be in a picture,

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:84%
you will not see
them in a picture.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.740 align:middle line:84%
They have abilities that
they can look at you

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and erase a certain memory
that you have if they want to.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:84%
It's complete control but
coming from a very high

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:90%
vibrational place.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.405 align:middle line:90%
How far back does TLS go?

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: I could tell you
that they've been in existence

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:90%
for over 5,000 years.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And, again, their power is
something that's incredible.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And do they meet,
these chapters, once a month

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.052 align:middle line:90%
or a week?

00:07:32.052 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SHURKA: There are meetings.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.160 align:middle line:90%
They have an office.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:84%
You just won't know
that it's a TLS office.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.610 align:middle line:84%
They have an office
in New York City.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:84%
They have an office
in Los Angeles.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.970 align:middle line:84%
They have an office everywhere,
especially in the major cities.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, are they militaristic?

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Are they trying to seek
any type of control?

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Are they similar to
the Illuminati, being

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.610 align:middle line:90%
hidden behind closed doors?

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: Number
one, they're just not

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
even close to a part
of the Illuminati.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:84%
They're the exact
opposite, especially when

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:90%
it comes to their intentions.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.853 align:middle line:84%
So again, ultimately,
they're here to--

00:08:03.853 --> 00:08:06.020 align:middle line:84%
if you want to talk about
the idea of the Illuminati

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:84%
without putting names
and all that out there,

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
it's suppression of humanity,
suppression of knowledge,

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:84%
suppression of
spirituality, in order

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
to keep us on a
certain resonance

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:84%
that we don't understand
what our true power is.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:84%
What TLS does is
the exact opposite.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a certain
timeline, based

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.980 align:middle line:84%
on how ready humanity
is at any given moment,

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
for things to be
able to be shown.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:84%
And it's one thing to
hear about a shapeshifter.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:90%
It's another thing to see one.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm an advocate
for the process of disclosure.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
it's very important

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:84%
to, first, tell somebody
that something strange exists

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:84%
before you show them that
thing that exists in order

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:90%
not to induce chaos.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:90%
They don't want chaos.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to bring us to
this new level of awareness

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
without causing problems along
the way, to wake us up slowly.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Jason, how does
TLS survive financially?

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what does that
structure look like?

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: First of all, to
run an operation like this,

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:84%
of this magnitude, of
this size, is something

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.360 align:middle line:90%
that does take a lot of money.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a very big operation.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a very organized operation.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So TLS is not dependent
on any donations

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:90%
or any of those things.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.780 align:middle line:84%
They have and operate
their own businesses

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.550 align:middle line:90%
through many different mediums.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:84%
There can be big businesses that
we know of today that they may

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:90%
be operating behind the scenes.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.275 align:middle line:84%
So through that is where
they have the financial means

00:09:34.275 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:90%
to do what they have to do.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And when they pay
their agents, they also

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:90%
pay them under an alias.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you
got a check from TLS.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.240 align:middle line:84%
It's an alias based on the
cover story that that agent has

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.070 align:middle line:84%
of what they do,
where they work.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell me how they
actually get the word out

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.800 align:middle line:84%
if they're so hidden
and secretive.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:84%
You're here, it looks
like, representing them.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:90%
But who else?

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.105 align:middle line:84%
How do they get this
information out to help us?

00:09:58.105 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: So there are
some initiated agents who

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
are very, very well-known
and world-renowned people

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that you just don't know
that are a part of TLS.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are
not those people.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.663 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are just
everyday human beings.

00:10:10.663 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Your mother could
be a part of it.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:90%
You would have no idea.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a cover.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Everybody gets paid
for their work,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:84%
with the exception of
the spiritual agents.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that's on
the spiritual side,

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.175 align:middle line:84%
generally, for the most part,
they do it as volunteer work.

00:10:25.175 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to the
physical side, all of them

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:90%
are paid.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to how
they get the word out,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:84%
take certain celebrities that
have impacts and influences.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Take certain producers that
create certain content.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Take certain authors
that write certain books.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Take certain people in the media
that give certain messages.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:90%
It could be subliminal.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.960 align:middle line:90%
It could not be subliminal.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.020 align:middle line:84%
They do it on purpose
through mediums

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
that we don't
necessarily understand

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
what's happening that's
affecting us energetically.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.068 align:middle line:84%
And again, there
are people that are

00:10:55.068 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
very well-known in the world
that are a part of it that

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:84%
can maybe stop certain
things from happening,

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.490 align:middle line:84%
make certain things happen,
depending on what's going on.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's all with the
intention of guiding

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
us to get to the place of
not being suppressed anymore,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.450 align:middle line:90%
to wake us up to our true power.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
here to control.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:84%
They let the evolution
of humanity's awareness

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.573 align:middle line:90%
happen as it has to happen.

00:11:20.573 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
things that they

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.828 align:middle line:84%
don't interfere with, like
elections, for example.

00:11:24.828 --> 00:11:25.870 align:middle line:90%
That's against the rules.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to
interfere with that.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:84%
But I will touch
up on something.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:84%
People ask me, well, if TLS
is this divine organization

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.570 align:middle line:84%
with all of this power
and they're so great,

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.480 align:middle line:84%
why do we have evil like
we do in the world today?

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they
just wipe them out?

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to
that-- and this

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:84%
is an answer that I was given,
understood, through them--

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:90%
was where is the power held?

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Is it in the few who are
controlling the many,

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:90%
or is it in the people?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And the illusion is that
the power is in the few.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure that
TLS can go wipe out

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:90%
certain individuals tomorrow.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that they can induce
a heart attack without even

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:90%
touching the human being.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And they could.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:90%
But they won't.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
they won't do that

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.650 align:middle line:90%
is because, let's say they did.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's say they wiped out
every being that's controlling

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:90%
and suppressing humanity today.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.870 align:middle line:84%
What's stopping those
people from being replaced?

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And the key to where
all of that exists in--

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is something
that I was taught and given

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
a lesson, understanding,
on-- is the reason

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84%
why these evil people,
if you want to call them,

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and controlling people
exist is because we

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:84%
the people allowed them to
exist in the first place.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So we empowered them.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SHURKA: We empowered them.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Look at Hitler.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.860 align:middle line:84%
We literally elected him into
power through a democracy.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a dictatorship
to begin with.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:90%
It was something that we chose.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, if
you take Hitler,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:84%
he was a reflection of our
consciousness at the time.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So the key to changing--
and this is how TLS works,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:84%
this is the key of
understanding their mission--

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:84%
is not directly to
take down the evil.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:84%
It's to educate and wake up the
masses so our resonance rises.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And when our resonance
and awareness rises,

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:84%
the reflected reality
will not be one

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:84%
where evil can exist
in the first place.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's a group,
collective, collaborative

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:90%
manifestation of positivity.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: It's an understanding
of just the basics

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.600 align:middle line:90%
of how energy works.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Our perception, our reality,
is a direct reflection

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.210 align:middle line:90%
of our awareness.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.790 align:middle line:84%
What we're in resonance with
is what we'll experience.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:84%
If we're in resonance with
lower vibrations like fear,

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:84%
corruption, and greed, we'll
experience fear, corruption,

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:90%
and greed.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And the moment we become
aware of how to tune out,

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and we're guided of how to
tune into a different frequency

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:84%
where evil and
corruption and greed

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:84%
are no longer in
resonance with us,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:84%
they won't be a part
of our reality anymore.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:90%
So that's how TLS works.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
It's to shift the awareness
and consciousness of the masses

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:84%
in order to reflect a shift
in our world into the way

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:09.930 align:middle line:90%
that we want to see it.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does TLS
have any type of bases

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:84%
that they can go and train at or
facilities that are clandestine

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:90%
around the planet?

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: For example,
there's a school.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I can't reveal the
location of that school.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But there's a school
where one of the leaders--

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
one of a few-- but
one of the leaders

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
has hundreds of students where
he teaches certain things more

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.520 align:middle line:90%
on the physical level.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to certain
bases, if you want to call it,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I know that in New Jersey and
in many places around the world,

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.100 align:middle line:90%
there's a specific field.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like a landing
strip but for UFOs.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really a strip,
it's just an open field.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:90%
It's public property.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not private.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.543 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
use whenever they either

00:14:54.543 --> 00:14:56.460 align:middle line:84%
have to load something--
it's like in and out,

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
things like that-- with
other races, other beings,

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.620 align:middle line:90%
with their crafts and all that.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:84%
What they do have, which
is pretty interesting,

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:84%
is it's like, OK,
well, how do you

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.120 align:middle line:84%
not see a ship
coming and landing

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of New Jersey?

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are a significant
amount of UFO sightings there.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:10%
But when it's on
the ground, there's

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:10%
this electromagnetic
field that-- they

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.950 align:middle line:10%
have this technology
that creates

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.620 align:middle line:10%
this field around the
craft that pretty much,

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.423 align:middle line:10%
if you were looking at
it, you wouldn't see

00:15:26.423 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:10%
that there's anything there.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.615 align:middle line:84%
It's like "Men in Black,"
if you've ever seen.

00:15:29.615 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:84%
There's something there,
and you can't see it.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's like a
cloaking device of some sort.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.107 align:middle line:90%
>>SHURKA: Yeah, pretty much.

00:15:33.107 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:90%
It's about a hundred feet.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So you can see when they're
coming in and going out.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's not slow landings.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely fast.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:84%
What I find interesting is that
there is no mark on the ground

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:90%
after they leave.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What
technologies does TLS

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:84%
have that we may not
see in everyday life?

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: The whole idea of the
Tesla grid, free energy system,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.700 align:middle line:90%
it's there.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:90%
It's 100% real.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.650 align:middle line:84%
They have access-- and I'm
saying access because it's not

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:90%
theirs--

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:84%
they have access to
certain, we can call

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.680 align:middle line:90%
it extraterrestrial technology.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
The crafts are the biggest
things that they really have.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And the way that those crafts
work are pretty unbelievable.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:90%
What I will add on to that is--

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is a missing
factor that I haven't

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:84%
seen in, at least,
a community and how

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:90%
things are being spoken about--

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.510 align:middle line:84%
we're under the impression
that these crafts work

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:90%
through physical technology.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And yes, it's a part of it.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just
physical technology.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It's what would be referred
to as spiritual technology.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:90%
So I'll explain what that means.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:84%
They have technology that
we all know of called EMP--

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic pulsation--
which, by the way,

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:84%
also existed in the
times of the pharaohs

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and those ancient
extraterrestrials.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:84%
They came here with
that technology.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing new.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:84%
There is EMLP, which is
an electromagnetic laser

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:90%
pulsation.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes
to certain crafts,

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:84%
the crafts don't
just work off of EMP

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and EMLP on the physical side.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.089 align:middle line:84%
They also work from the energy
from the sun and magnetism.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:84%
The real question
is, well, how do

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:84%
these crafts
operate at thousands

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of miles per hour
and suddenly make a 90 degree

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:27.780 align:middle line:90%
turn?

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:84%
How does that happen without
the craft blowing up and any

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:84%
being inside it being
squashed against the wall?

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
The key that I was taught that
I haven't seen, for some reason,

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:84%
anywhere else-- maybe it's
just I haven't done enough

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:90%
research--

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:84%
but when I say
spiritual technology,

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:84%
there is something called
the power of thought.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:90%
So there's the speed of sound.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:90%
There is the speed of light.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's
faster in the universe

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:84%
than the speed of light
is thought and the way

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:90%
that it travels.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.510 align:middle line:84%
But there's all different
shapes and sizes

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and pyramids and triangles and
saucers and pills and all that.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.018 align:middle line:90%
The inside doesn't look like a--

00:18:08.018 --> 00:18:11.930 align:middle line:84%
it's not like a 747 cockpit with
a bunch of different buttons

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.270 align:middle line:84%
that you have to know how
this and this and this.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.970 align:middle line:84%
There are a few
touch-screen buttons,

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:21.530 align:middle line:84%
but there's this like panel or
dashboard of some sort that's

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.780 align:middle line:90%
made of crystal or glass.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:84%
That's what connects the
consciousness of the operator,

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:32.510 align:middle line:84%
through the power of thought, to
the actual physical technology

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:90%
that's operating the craft.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that
has to be understood,

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and this is what these
beings understand

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
at their level of awareness,
is that there is no such thing

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:90%
as something not being alive.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Everything is alive.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Everything is connected,
whether it's a rock,

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a cup, whether
it's a human being, whether it's

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.510 align:middle line:90%
a plant.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:84%
No matter what it
is, all matter is

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.000 align:middle line:84%
connected to this unified
field of consciousness.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And through their level of
awareness, which is very high,

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:84%
they have the ability to
connect to this unified field

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So right now, we're just
talking about it conceptually.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:90%
They can actually do it.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.297 align:middle line:84%
So through that power of
thought, they take their hand.

00:19:16.297 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they don't even
have to touch the panel.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.330 align:middle line:84%
But let's say they're
touching the panel.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the craft
takes on the consciousness

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.590 align:middle line:90%
of the operator.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So the fact is is that this
higher level of consciousness

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:90%
that the operators hold--

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:84%
in this case, the ETs
and, in some cases,

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:84%
humans that are put
through certain training,

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.310 align:middle line:84%
they can transcend the
limitations of time and space.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:90%
That's where their awareness is.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And because their
awareness transcends

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:84%
the limitations of time and
space, so does the craft.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And it works in
ways that don't work

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:84%
according to the laws of
physics as we know them today.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Because our understanding
of the laws of physics

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.370 align:middle line:84%
today are a reflection
of our awareness

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.880 align:middle line:90%
today on the collective level.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with science.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.730 align:middle line:84%
What science deems are
the criteria for something

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:90%
to be alive, it's very limited.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And there will
come a day where we

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
reach a higher
level of awareness,

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:84%
like these beings who
operate their crafts,

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and will come to
understand that way.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
about something

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:84%
that has genetic material
and that can replicate.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.080 align:middle line:84%
It's something that has
to do with what everything

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
can be deduced to, which is
energy and consciousness,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.340 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So their technology
is extraordinary.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:84%
They can travel
intergalactically

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.955 align:middle line:90%
in five minutes.

00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
intergalactically,

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.510 align:middle line:84%
we're talking not
within the Milky Way.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.002 align:middle line:84%
You could-- trillions
of light years away.

00:20:38.002 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Because those things
don't affect them anymore.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.793 align:middle line:90%
It's not about time.

00:20:40.793 --> 00:20:41.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not about distance.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right, there is no
time or space or distance.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.748 align:middle line:90%
>>SHURKA: None of that.

00:20:44.748 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Time doesn't exist the
way that we experience it

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:90%
here on those planets.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:90%
It's completely different.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
What type of projects
and technologies

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
does the TLS have that are
for our future benefit,

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.542 align:middle line:84%
the civilians, the
humans of the planet?

00:20:59.542 --> 00:21:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that
they have lined up

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.435 align:middle line:90%
for us that could help us?

00:21:02.435 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SHURKA: They have crafts.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.010 align:middle line:84%
There are certain-- if we go
to ancient, more ancient--

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.615 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When are they going
to release this technology?

00:21:09.615 --> 00:21:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: When, in
terms of a timeline?

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of when in a
different way to answer-- when

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.440 align:middle line:90%
we're ready to receive it.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we come in.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just a matter of
TLS is doing things for us.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:84%
It's humanity is
responsible for humanity.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
freedom of choice.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
We can choose to
keep ourselves not

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:84%
being ready to receive
certain things.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.590 align:middle line:84%
We can choose to open our minds
to receive certain things.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So personally, that's
part of my motivation

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:90%
for doing any of this.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:84%
It's to kind of
facilitate in any way

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.078 align:middle line:84%
that process of becoming ready
in a more efficient and timely

00:21:45.078 --> 00:21:46.370 align:middle line:90%
manner, if you want to call it.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It definitely sounds
like their consciousness

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
is extraterrestrial, based
through my experience.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
are always asking,

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:84%
why can't they just come here
and give us all this stuff?

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you
said, we're just not

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:84%
ready yet for that
before giving us

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:84%
so much power in a lot of
these amazing technologies

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:90%
you have mentioned.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.985 align:middle line:90%
>>SHURKA: Absolutely.

00:22:06.985 --> 00:22:09.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, just to
piggyback off of that,

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of people
that say, OK, well,

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.110 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about all
these extraordinary things.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:90%
Where is the proof?

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very important
thing to talk about.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Because where's the proof?

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to
certain teachings--

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and this also connects to space
and certain things that exist

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.305 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:22:30.305 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
the foundation is there's
an energetic understanding,

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.720 align:middle line:84%
or there must be an energetic
understanding, of how

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:90%
frequency and resonance works.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
our range of awareness

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:84%
is limited from frequency or
dimension-- let's say 1 to 5,

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.370 align:middle line:84%
or let's go back to the
gamma, beta, theta, alpha.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:53.420 align:middle line:84%
If we're in beta 7,
or if I'm in beta 7,

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I will not be able to
perceive something in beta 8.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in gamma 5, I will not
be able to perceive something

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:90%
in gamma 8, and so on.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Our range of awareness,
it pretty much

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:84%
dictates our perception
and what we can see.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just about physical
seeing, it's also about the way

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:90%
that you understand information.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why I bring
that up with the idea of where

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:84%
is the proof is there could
be proof in front of us

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:84%
right now,
perceptually speaking,

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:90%
and we can't perceive it.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.730 align:middle line:84%
There can also be proof that's
already been given to us,

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and we just don't
understand that it's proof

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:84%
because we're not at
the level of awareness

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.675 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
this truly means.

00:23:34.675 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, absolutely.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.785 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: So that's
where I would go in

00:23:38.785 --> 00:23:40.160 align:middle line:90%
on where's the proof.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How is TLS
going to reveal itself

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.203 align:middle line:84%
to the general population,
do you believe?

00:23:44.203 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: So I'll
say they already

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
started through this
medium of me putting out

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:90%
certain information and whatnot.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:84%
But let's say TLS came out
today and showed high technology

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:84%
crafts and extraterrestrials
and hologram beings

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.177 align:middle line:90%
and everything in between.

00:24:02.177 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:84%
It would probably freak
a lot of people out.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.500 align:middle line:84%
There are many people that
are ready to receive that.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But on the collective level of
our human race on the universe,

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:90%
it would cause a lot of chaos.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:84%
They will reveal
themselves to that extent

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.240 align:middle line:84%
when people are ready
to receive that.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.040 align:middle line:90%
But that's up to us.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.880 align:middle line:84%
How open are we to changing
our belief systems?

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
How open are we to letting
our belief systems dissolve

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and start fresh, even
if it's uncomfortable?

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And how open are we to accepting
that new possibilities that we

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
might have thought in the past
were impossible may actually

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.720 align:middle line:90%
be possible?

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do
the humans interact

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:90%
with the non-TLS humans.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: Just like
it is right now.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Because they're taught to have
a standard of communication.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So there is telepathic
communication,

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.300 align:middle line:84%
but everybody's taught
how to communicate.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.920 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
if they're here,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.870 align:middle line:90%
you communicate like earthlings.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.770 align:middle line:90%
So we speak.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:90%
We talk.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And other beings that come
here that work with TLS

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:90%
are trained on how to do that.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How far along is
TLS in the process of doing

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.575 align:middle line:90%
what they were created to do?

00:25:12.575 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: In terms of
how far along they are,

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I think right now, we're
in a very significant time

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
period that's a very big turning
point, and it's a milestone.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the fact that an
organization like TLS that's

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:10%
been in existence for over
5,000 years behind the scenes

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.260 align:middle line:10%
is suddenly coming
and feels humanity

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:10%
is ready to accept this, it
shows that we're making shifts.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they say
that we're in what's

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.110 align:middle line:90%
called the Age of Light.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So the Age of Light is
this age where we're in now

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:90%
that things are being exposed.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.435 align:middle line:90%
Information is being exposed.

00:25:46.435 --> 00:25:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
what we're seeing.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Look at what we're
doing right now.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And the next age that
they want to bring us to,

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:84%
which is what I
refer to as gamma,

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.900 align:middle line:84%
or fifth-dimensional
awareness, is

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:90%
what they call the Age of Love.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's a time where our
world looks very much like ET

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.240 align:middle line:90%
planets today.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.440 align:middle line:90%
There's no borders.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:90%
There's no war.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:90%
There's no disease.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:84%
There's none of this
low-vibrational experience

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.210 align:middle line:84%
of me and you, and
we're separate.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's none of that.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a time where there's
intergalactic unity.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a time of love.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a time where evil is not
a part of our reality anymore.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:90%
There is no corruption.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.690 align:middle line:90%
There's no greed.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.330 align:middle line:84%
There's no doctors because
there's no sickness.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.910 align:middle line:84%
There's an understanding
of how nature works

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and how to guide
through it intuitively

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:90%
through your understanding.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:90%
You don't need a nutritionist.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You speak
about the Age of Love.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:84%
What happens if humans
don't reach a higher

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.890 align:middle line:84%
level of awareness
and consciousness

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.847 align:middle line:84%
to be relevant for
the Age of Love?

00:26:44.847 --> 00:26:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SHURKA: When it comes to
timelines and the information

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.060 align:middle line:84%
that I've received from
TLS when certain things are

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
going to happen,
and the answer is

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:90%
we could experience this now.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.550 align:middle line:84%
We could bring this
in our lifetime.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:84%
We could bring it in five
years, in 10 years, in 30 years,

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.110 align:middle line:90%
or in 50 years.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:84%
It's all dependent on what we
decide to do along the way.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we step in,
where they're not controlling

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:90%
us, they're just guiding us.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
freedom of choice comes in.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there
a vision of TLS

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:90%
that maybe this will not happen?

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SHURKA: No.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:84%
No, this is what they would
call the collective destiny

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:18.782 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:27:18.782 --> 00:27:20.490 align:middle line:84%
No matter what, we're
going to get there.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:90%
The question is how.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Their purpose,
really, their mission,

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.510 align:middle line:84%
is beyond just assisting
and guiding us to reach

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.110 align:middle line:90%
this new level of awareness.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.690 align:middle line:84%
It's doing so with as
little damage along the way.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what they always try
to do-- as little bloodshed,

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:84%
as little damage, as little
problems along the way,

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:40.050 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate our awakening
process in a comfortable way.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.590 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, I think we're
in a very positive place right

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.390 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Although some people
may not see it that way,

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I think we're in a
very good trajectory.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I think the fact that episodes
like this are happening

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
in the first place
is proof that we're

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:84%
in the right direction
of disclosure, awareness,

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.070 align:middle line:90%
knowledge.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, so long as
we keep doing what we're doing,

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.580 align:middle line:84%
we learn from our past,
from our history--

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.520 align:middle line:84%
again, that's why I think
this is happening right now--

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.610 align:middle line:84%
we can make our next steps
in the right direction

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:13.640 align:middle line:84%
for not just the
benefit of humanity

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:84%
but the intergalactic
connectivity of all life

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.610 align:middle line:90%
in the universe as a whole.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Jason, thank you
for being on the show.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.210 align:middle line:90%
It's been a great awakening.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And I can't wait to hear the
viewers' responses to this.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.587 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:28:28.587 --> 00:28:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SHURKA: Thank you.

this is "Cosmic Disclosure."
