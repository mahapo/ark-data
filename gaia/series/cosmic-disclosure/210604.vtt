00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with John Ramirez,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:10%
a retired CIA officer who served
as chief of the electronic

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:10%
intelligence branch and
specialized in ballistic

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:10%
missile defense,
weapons systems radar,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:10%
and technical
collection operations.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Today he shares his experiences
at the CIA and his perspectives

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:90%
on the UFO UAP reality.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:90%
John, welcome to the show.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> John, for our viewers,
please explain about who you are

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:90%
and your work at the CIA.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:10%
>> So I entered the CIA in 1984
in the signals intelligence

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:10%
field.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:10%
And I had a background
in signals intelligence

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.440 align:middle line:10%
through the Navy when I
served six years on board

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.410 align:middle line:10%
various ships collecting
signals and learning

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.920 align:middle line:10%
how to counter
missile seekers that

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:10%
may be threatening the ship.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And that was a skill set
that was a value to CIA

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:84%
because I knew
about electronics,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.550 align:middle line:90%
I knew about radars.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:10%
And after I left the Navy, I
went to school for four years

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:10%
at George Washington University
majoring in political science.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:10%
And while I was there,
I contacted CIA,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:10%
and they offered me a position.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, that position was
in a newspaper advertisement

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:10%
for people with military
SIGINT backgrounds.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:10%
And so I applied in a year
later through a security process

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:10%
that took a year,
including what they

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:10%
call a lifestyle polygraph,
which is very intrusive.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:10%
I finally was
invited to join CIA,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.632 align:middle line:10%
and I entered CIA
in June of 1984.

00:01:57.632 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you tell us a little
bit about what you did there,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.890 align:middle line:90%
John?

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, most of the work is
classified, but I can say this.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:10%
Signals intelligence as a
discipline is not classified.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:10%
It is the analysis of
electromagnetic emissions.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:10%
And in my case, these
electromagnetic emissions

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:10%
were emanated by
weapons systems radars.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:10%
And I specialized in
antiballistic missile radars--

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:10%
ballistic missile defense
radars and systems.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:10%
And so I was given an account.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:10%
What we call account
is area of expertise

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:10%
where I became
the subject matter

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.720 align:middle line:10%
expert in certain classes of
these ballistic missile defense

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:10%
radars in the Soviet
Union at the time.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.380 align:middle line:10%
And so through analysis
of these signals,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.230 align:middle line:10%
I gained some expertise
in these systems.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.010 align:middle line:10%
And this led to an
understanding that some

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:10%
of the targets of
interest to the Soviets

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:10%
were like unusual targets, what
we would call UFOs or UAPs.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:84%
They didn't call them that, but
they were tracking something

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't a missile.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.850 align:middle line:10%
And usually, when
these radars operate,

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.710 align:middle line:10%
it's against a missile target.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So they will launch a missile,
and they'll go to its range.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:10%
And it will then
reenter the atmosphere

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:10%
and then impact about
2,000 miles away

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:10%
from the launch point.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.630 align:middle line:10%
And these radars
will be operating

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:10%
to track these missiles.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So we noticed that
these radars were

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
operating in the absence
of a missile test.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And these radars were
tracking something

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:84%
in the absence of
a missile test.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:10%
And of course,
that interested us.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.225 align:middle line:10%
And so through various
technical means,

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:10%
we were able to determine
there was something

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:10%
in the aerospace domain
and then the atmosphere

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:10%
that was of interest to them.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:10%
And they were transmitting track
beams as if it was a missile.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.040 align:middle line:10%
But as far as exactly
what they were,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:10%
we did not know at the time.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there any ideas of
where it was coming from?

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Did you guys think maybe it
was one of the countries?

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Did you think it maybe it was
our own maybe secret program?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.229 align:middle line:10%
>> We knew it wasn't ours
because we very much know what

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:10%
we have.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:10%
And we would not be flying
anything over Soviet airspace

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:10%
because that's an act of war.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:10%
We also knew that there was some
reporting of something called

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:10%
domes of light that
appeared over certain test

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:10%
ranges, certain nuclear
facilities in the Soviet Union.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:10%
And at first, we thought
the domes of light

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:10%
were some type of ballistic
missile countermeasures.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.360 align:middle line:10%
That is that they would
create these domes of light

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:10%
to confuse our
ability to discern

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:10%
the composition of
their attack in case

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:10%
a nuclear war broke
out, they would

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:10%
want to protect their missiles.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:10%
And so that these domes of light
may have been a countermeasure

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:10%
to prevent us from determining
how many missiles were arrayed

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:10%
against us and where the
impact points of those missiles

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:10%
might be.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:10%
However, the Soviets were also
seeing these domes of light,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:10%
so we were like
pretty much thinking

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:10%
that these domes of
light were technology

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:10%
arrayed against each
other from our adversary.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:10%
And the Soviets thought
that the adversary being us

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:10%
that it was our technology.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:10%
So the domes of
light were actually

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.672 align:middle line:10%
what we might call today orbs.

00:05:37.672 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:10%
But back then, they were
called domes of light.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:10%
And the analysts at the
foreign technology division

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:10%
at the time at Wright-Patterson
Air Force base,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.910 align:middle line:10%
they assessed these domes
alight as ballistic missile

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:10%
countermeasures.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us a little bit more
about your exposure to ET

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.160 align:middle line:90%
intelligence and UFO.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I have no exposure to
intelligence officially.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.820 align:middle line:10%
Most of them have been through
my own personal experiences.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm a lifelong experiencer
since the age of four

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.622 align:middle line:84%
when I first saw
through a telescope.

00:06:08.622 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us a little
bit about that.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:10%
I saw through a telescope, and
I had this profound feeling

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:10%
that I didn't belong
on the planet.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:10%
That what I was seeing through
the telescope, the moon,

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:10%
the stars, maybe some planets,
that's where I belong.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:10%
And I felt that very strongly
even at that young age.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:10%
And that was in Japan.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:10%
And so when I was five
years old, I moved to the US

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:10%
with my father and my
mother followed later.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:10%
But I was living with
my aunt and uncle.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:10%
And so with my cousins,
we were playing outdoors.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:10%
And this was in Fort Lee,
Virginia military housing

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:10%
because my uncle
was in the army.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:10%
So we were playing with my
cousins and our friends there.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:10%
And I looked over to my
right and above the tree

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:08.010 align:middle line:10%
line of a forest nearby,
I saw this silver shape

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:10%
rising above the tree line.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't like
a blimp or anything.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:10%
There was no Gondola, there
was no means of propulsion.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.160 align:middle line:84%
It was just this silver
kind of blimp-like shape

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.330 align:middle line:90%
with no means of propulsion.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Did others view it
too that were there?

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:10%
>> I pointed it out to them
and they could not see it.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:10%
They could not see
what I was seeing.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And it rose above the tree
line and then went away.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>> With everything you've
been exposed to up to today,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:84%
how could you explain yourself
looking at this craft but no

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:90%
one else saw that?

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Perhaps it was meant for me.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps that this sighting
was my sighting and not anyone

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:10%
else's.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:10%
And that became part of my
experience throughout my life.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I used to have
these memories of being taken

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:10%
to a house where we lived.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:10%
This was after we left
Fort Lee, Virginia.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:10%
My mother has now
joined the family.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:10%
And so we're at 1959,
1960, first grade.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:10%
And I remember being
taken to a house that

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:10%
was like I would call
a Victorian-style house

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:27.850 align:middle line:10%
with a turret on the left
side and a wraparound porch.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:10%
There was a picket fence,
you know, and a sidewalk.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:10%
And I was being
led into the house

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:10%
by a woman who
was not my mother.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:10%
And I would go into
the house, and she

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:42.010 align:middle line:10%
would lead me to a room on
the left side of the house.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:10%
And there was a medical
examining room, but not

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.650 align:middle line:10%
anything that would be current
for 1959, 1960 time frame.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:84%
It looked like I was back
in the Victorian era,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:90%
some bygone time.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:10%
And the doctor and a
nurse there were also

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:10%
dressed as if they
were from that era.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:10%
And they would undress
me and put me on a table

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:10%
where they would examine me.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have
any memory other

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:90%
than they would examine me.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>> In what way?

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:middle line:90%
Like in detail, did they--

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:84%
you said they took
your clothes off,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.110 align:middle line:84%
they put you on
a table of sorts.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:10%
>> They examined me just
primarily just like listening

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:10%
to my heart, opening my mouth,
say ah, that kind of thing,

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:10%
looking into my ears.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.735 align:middle line:84%
It was just a routine, I would
guess a medical examination.

00:09:35.735 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> But there's no other
children around from the school.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:90%
It was just you--

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.125 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:39.925 align:middle line:90%
>> --this woman.

00:09:39.925 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Just myself, the woman who
escorted me there, a doctor,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.355 align:middle line:10%
and a nurse.

00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened right after
that, after the examination?

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I would get dressed again.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:10%
They would dress me
again, and the woman

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:10%
would lead me out of the house.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:10%
And there, the memory fades.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.680 align:middle line:10%
But this was a
recurring experience

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:10%
because I had it again.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.150 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes, they would
lead-- she would lead me up

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:10%
to the right side of
the house or a staircase

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:10%
and then going to the left
to another medical examining

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:10%
room above the previous
one on the first floor.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:10%
And there, the same
process would happen again.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:10%
And I'll be let out of that
room after it was over and down

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.980 align:middle line:10%
the steps and out.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.313 align:middle line:90%
And then the memory fades again.

00:10:23.313 --> 00:10:24.113 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:24.113 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Did you talk to your
family about that?

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.820 align:middle line:10%
>> I asked my mother about it,
and she said that she never

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:10%
took me to any kind
of exam like that.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Later on, did you come to
a conclusion what might have

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:84%
happened or why you
had those memories?

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:10%
>> I did much later on.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:10%
I think that it was my
first contact experience

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:49.370 align:middle line:10%
where perhaps they
may have in some way

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:10%
identified me as a person
of interest to them.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:10%
>> And what year was that?

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.220 align:middle line:10%
How old were you?

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:10%
>> My first realization
of that came much later--

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.900 align:middle line:10%
much later in life when I looked
back upon it because there were

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:10%
other experiences where
I did receive some kind

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.185 align:middle line:10%
of messaging of sorts.

00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So this has been building
up over a decade or something?

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:90%
More?

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Because right after that
memory of being examined,

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I was in a department
store, Five-and-Dime

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:90%
as they called them back then.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I guess they're called
dollar stores now.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:10%
But a Five-and-Dime, and
there was a bin of books.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:10%
And I was really
interested in books.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:10%
And my parents, they
may not buy me toys,

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:10%
but they encouraged me to read.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:10%
And so they had no qualms buying
me a book if I wanted one.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just thumbing
through the spine of books,

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and my parents were
shopping elsewhere

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:90%
in that department store.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:10%
And I opened up a book
and thumbed through it.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was a picture on the
left side on the left page.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And on the lower left
side of that page,

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.830 align:middle line:84%
there was an
illustration, a drawing.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:84%
It was two, I guess, you
would call them cave people,

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:84%
but they were
dressed primitively.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.680 align:middle line:10%
And above them were two saucers.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And the saucer, one was
illuminating the woman.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And she had in her
hand a human baby,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and she was lifting
it up to the saucer.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And that human baby
looked more modern.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.280 align:middle line:90%
It didn't look like the parents.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:10%
And I got that message
that this is who you are,

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.680 align:middle line:10%
this is where you came from.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think maybe they
showed you this picture,

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.302 align:middle line:90%
guided you to this book?

00:12:35.302 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the name of
the book or anything like that?

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I did not.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I wanted that book.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I put it down so I
can get it again,

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and there was hardly
anyone in sort I remember.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.260 align:middle line:84%
I got my mother and I
wanted to show the book

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and where I placed the book.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.140 align:middle line:90%
It disappeared.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:90%
I could not find it ever again.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And how old were
you around that time?

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I was about 6 or seven
years old at the time.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Six or seven?

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Was there any other
more experiences

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:90%
that you started having?

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, right after that,
I had a profound interest

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.510 align:middle line:90%
in astronomy.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And I picked that as a
profession for the future.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:90%
I was interested in space.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:10%
It was during the
Mercury program,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:10%
of course, so there was a lot of
interest in space exploration.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to
be an astronomer.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And so my parents purchased
a telescope for me--

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and it was a fairly
good telescope--

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:90%
and an astronomy book.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And in the astronomy
book, I learned

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.230 align:middle line:84%
about there's something
called the Andromeda galaxy.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And it showed me
where to look for it.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I got my telescope
out and it was very cold

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:90%
and it was crisp winter evening.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking for
the Andromeda galaxy,

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and I was so happy to
find it in my telescope.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.620 align:middle line:84%
There it was, a small
disk, because it

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.107 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a really good telescope.

00:13:53.107 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:90%
It was something you give a kid.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>> But you could still see it,
sometimes with the naked eye.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a disk.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:58.520 align:middle line:90%
It was a disk.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked
at that disk, I

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:84%
had this message that
there was someone there

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.670 align:middle line:90%
looking back at me.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:12.140 align:middle line:84%
That as I was wondering, you
know, what am I looking at?

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Is there someone there?

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
The answer I got was,
yes, someone is there

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:90%
looking back at me.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And again I felt like I was
abandoned on the planet,

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't belong in the
planet, and that they

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:90%
forgot to pick me up.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.588 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted them to pick me up.

00:14:28.588 --> 00:14:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And this was going through
your head while you were having

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:90%
this download?

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.690 align:middle line:84%
I guess you would call
it today a download.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:10%
But that's been the theme of
many of my early experiences.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Since then, have you had
contact with anyone from

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Andromeda?

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if
they're from Andromeda.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any idea
where they're from.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:55.100 align:middle line:84%
But as I entered my
adolescent years,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
some of these experiences
started to reoccur.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was being inside
a cave and be led into the cave

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:90%
by small people.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.680 align:middle line:90%
I call them small people.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:90%
They're not like the greys.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.990 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the
almond-shaped eyes.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:90%
But they were small.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>> In size, like how
many feet or meters?

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Like four feet.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:84%
They seemed very human,
except that they were small.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>> What were they wearing?

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Some type of jumpsuit,
I would call it.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Some tight fitting.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they small and
looked like adults,

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.650 align:middle line:84%
or were they small
like children?

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> They didn't
look like children.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.445 align:middle line:84%
They look like adults
that were small.

00:15:34.445 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> But their head did seem a
little larger than what you

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:90%
would think to be a human.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:46.685 align:middle line:84%
There were-- seemed to be about
a dozen or more escorting me.

00:15:46.685 --> 00:15:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And they all look the same?

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>> They pretty much
looked all the same.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:90%
I felt a little fear.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
go into that cave.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.580 align:middle line:84%
But I guess telepathically
they told me

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:84%
because I don't remember them
speaking to me through voice,

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.850 align:middle line:90%
"You have nothing to fear."

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:06.455 align:middle line:84%
>> And where did
you end up going?

00:16:06.455 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't remember.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I just remember OK,
I'll walk with you.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Right after that, did
anything else start happening

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.265 align:middle line:84%
in your life that
changed anything?

00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Did you have more experiences
that you could share?

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I did, but not immediately.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I had this feeling that I
needed to plant sunflower seeds

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:84%
outside my bedroom
window because I

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.580 align:middle line:84%
wanted the sunflowers
to grow so that they'll

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:90%
know where to find me.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.770 align:middle line:10%
And sure enough, one
evening after the sunflowers

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:10%
have grown, one evening, I
guess I was sleeping then,

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:10%
I had this sensation
of arms and hands

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:10%
grabbing me and taking me out
of my bed through that window

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.560 align:middle line:10%
and up into a craft.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And could you explain, did
you see any beings or just

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.780 align:middle line:90%
the arms is all you saw or?

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Once I was inside the craft,
I was held in a prone position

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:10%
in the arms of another
being that was tall.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being
carried in that manner.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:16.079 align:middle line:10%
And I remember that the walls
of the craft in this corridor,

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:20.430 align:middle line:10%
I guess you would call
it, were concave, I think.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was circular
because I could tell

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:90%
that the walls were turning.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.975 align:middle line:90%
And he, the being, was walking--

00:17:31.975 --> 00:17:33.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us about the being.

00:17:33.523 --> 00:17:34.323 align:middle line:90%
>> --the corner.

00:17:34.323 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> How tall was he?

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.395 align:middle line:84%
And give us some features
of what he looked like.

00:17:38.395 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't remember the face.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I remember my head being tossed
back as he was carrying me.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't support my head,
he just supported my torso.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:10%
So my head was tossed
backward, and then

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.250 align:middle line:10%
I could see through my eyes
that it was a tall being,

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.260 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't see
the face so much.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
As he was walking
me into a room,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I remember a platform of
sorts and that he placed me

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:84%
on the platform and there were
other beings there as if there

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.995 align:middle line:84%
was going to be an
examination of some sort.

00:18:17.995 --> 00:18:20.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you recall
the examination or?

00:18:20.845 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't recall
the examination.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:10%
The entire craft internally,
inside wasn't lit with lights.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It sort of like
glowed on its own.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:90%
It was white.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very white.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't
tell that there was

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.890 align:middle line:90%
any kind of external lighting.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The material seemed
very luminescent.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:10%
And the room that I was taken
to was very, very bright.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.395 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the next thing you
remember is waking up in bed

00:18:54.395 --> 00:18:55.195 align:middle line:90%
or?

00:18:55.195 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The next thing I
remember is waking up.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But strangely, I had
markings on my body.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, so there's like physical
evidence from this that you--

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> There were markings on my
body, yes, in the groin area.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:90%
And they disappeared.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:10%
It was nothing I told
my parents about.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>> What did they look like?

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Just red.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Were they hurting,
was it painful or?

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not at all.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like it was some
type of device placed there

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.435 align:middle line:90%
that left a mark.

00:19:22.435 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, tell us a little bit
when you were around 16 years

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:84%
of age, you had some
other experiences.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:90%
This was a two-part experience.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't connect the
entire parts until later.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> But when I was
about 16 years old,

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I had a very vivid dream of
being in a, I guess you were

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:84%
calling an ethereal kind of
cosmic place of light beings.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I saw other light
beings there and I

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.980 align:middle line:90%
was one of the light beings.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was really happy, I
said, finally, I'm home.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.690 align:middle line:90%
This is where I belong.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go anywhere.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But a voice came on
my left side saying,

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:84%
it's time for you to
continue your work.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:90%
You need to go back.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.110 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't want to.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And the voice said,
you have to go back.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.360 align:middle line:10%
You have a job to do, and it's
time for you to do that job.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.200 align:middle line:10%
But you can choose
who you want to be.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:28.570 align:middle line:10%
And I was presented
with a vast, vast field,

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:33.640 align:middle line:10%
I guess you would call it,
of little shiny spheres

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.490 align:middle line:10%
of cloudy light.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And the light that I picked when
I was flying over these spheres

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.340 align:middle line:90%
was a blue and white light.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like a glass globe with
lit blue and white smoke in it.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you see
your body, John,

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
or it was just you
or that of the light?

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I was like an ethereal being
looking into this glass globe.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked into it, I
saw this person's entire life

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.240 align:middle line:90%
from birth to death.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this is
who I want to be.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.640 align:middle line:90%
And the voice said, go.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.450 align:middle line:10%
And at that moment, I
remember being born.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Vividly remembered being born.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I remember the voices of
the doctors in attendance,

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:90%
the nurses in attendance.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:90%
I remember my birth experience.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So years later under hypnosis,
under past life regression

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.820 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis, I was able
to connect the two.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I had a quantum healing hypnosis
technique by a practitioner.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And through that session,
I was able to connect

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.440 align:middle line:90%
what happened prior to that.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:51.457 align:middle line:84%
And in that experience, I was
a man in Victorian England.

00:21:51.457 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's that
Victorian connection.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.165 align:middle line:90%
>> There it is again, yeah.

00:21:54.165 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had a wife, and we
were sitting outdoors in a field

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:90%
where there was a picnic.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:90%
And I remember I was a printer.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we went back
to where we lived.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a print shop, and we
lived on the second floor.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, she passed away young
because she had some kind

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:90%
of respiratory ailment.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember going
forward in that session,

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:90%
I went to the end of my life.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the practitioner asked
me to go to the end of my life.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I am in a
Victorian setting in some kind

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:90%
of medical setting, I'm dying.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's nurses
and doctors there.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'm now dying.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not rising
above my body.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And she told me, look
back, and who do you see?

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:10%
And I saw myself.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:90%
I saw what I looked like.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And I said they're putting
the sheet over my head

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:90%
because I'm gone.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:10%
And she said, turn around
and continues your journey.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I saw not what
I call a tunnel of darkness.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.880 align:middle line:84%
It was like dark grey that
got progressively lighter.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So from dark grey
to lighter grey.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And as it became lighter
grey, I saw two light beings,

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:16.690 align:middle line:84%
one on the left, one on the
right coming to escort me home.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And I felt very happy because
when they escorted me home,

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.950 align:middle line:90%
it got lighter and lighter.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I was back
into this world of light

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.355 align:middle line:84%
with these other
light beings like me.

00:23:29.355 --> 00:23:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there anything else that
you discovered that linked you

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:90%
to these ETs?

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Not directly, but I had I
would guess you would call it

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:90%
precognitive experiences.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And even before then when I
was six or seven years old,

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I knew exactly
what school I'd be

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:84%
going to because my parents took
my sister and I to Washington

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.680 align:middle line:90%
D.C. and we got lost.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:90%
And we got lost in, what was it?

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.030 align:middle line:90%
College campus.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was the George Washington
University, I learned later on.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But I told my dad,
this is where I'm

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:90%
going to go to school someday.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I was going to
join the Navy because my aunt

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and uncle lived near
Yorktown, Virginia

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:middle line:84%
in the Tidewater area of
Virginia, a lot of Navy folks

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.040 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sure.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And I saw like Navy officers
in the area in their vehicles.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And I told my dad, I'm
going to join the Navy.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And when I was seven
or eight years old,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:90%
we had to write an essay.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And the essay was, what do you
want to be when you grow up?

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:44.490 align:middle line:90%
And I said I wanted to be a spy.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And everyone laughed
at me, of course.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But I had this feeling
that that's where

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.360 align:middle line:90%
my career path would take me.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And how many of these
premonitions came true?

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.933 align:middle line:90%
>> All of them came true.

00:24:55.933 --> 00:24:56.850 align:middle line:90%
All of them came true.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is what
led you to the CIA.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I always had an interest
in Naval service.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I had an interest in
intelligence field.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that's
why they contacted you?

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Was that what was
the agenda there?

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm wondering if
they put these ideas

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.200 align:middle line:10%
or put these thoughts
in my mind that this

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.370 align:middle line:10%
is something I should pursue
because everything led to CIA.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was at CIA when I
started learning more about what

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.410 align:middle line:90%
is going on in the UFO field.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had some
experiences through my life

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.230 align:middle line:84%
while working at CIA where I
had beings appear in my bedroom.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And there were
friendly beings.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
They were not
harmful in any way.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Again, I had the
same experience,

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.990 align:middle line:90%
we're not here to hurt you.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.490 align:middle line:90%
We just want to check up on you.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.230 align:middle line:84%
We just want to
see if you're OK.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't go anywhere.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go into any craft
or anything like that,

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.060 align:middle line:90%
but they were there.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Just making themselves--

00:25:59.957 --> 00:26:01.540 align:middle line:84%
making you aware
that they were there.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.830 align:middle line:84%
But I did have one
such appearance

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:84%
of a being that tended to
be more hostile or maybe

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.560 align:middle line:90%
more aggressive, I should say.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was
malevolent, but I fought it off.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
It came toward me
and for some reason,

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I rose halfway out
of my bed and I start

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:90%
punching it and punching it.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing
I remember was waking up.

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And again, there were
markings on my body,

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:36.815 align:middle line:84%
specifically my right arm that
I used to punch this being.

00:26:36.815 --> 00:26:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you recall what the being
looked like or was it a shadow?

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It was very much what
we would call a reptilian,

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.160 align:middle line:90%
but not like a lizard.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I want to make plain and make
sure that these beings are not

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.710 align:middle line:90%
like lizard beings.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.930 align:middle line:84%
They were reptilian in the
sense that their ancestry may

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.210 align:middle line:84%
have come from what
we call reptiles,

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.330 align:middle line:84%
much as we may have ancestry
from the great primates,

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:84%
but we don't look
like great primates.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:09.445 align:middle line:84%
And so similar to that they
were reptilian but not lizards.

00:27:09.445 --> 00:27:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything relayed to
you from this reptilian?

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The reptilian being
wanted to take me somewhere,

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't want to go.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.460 align:middle line:90%
And so I punched it.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was rewarded with like
claw marks on my right arm.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Was that your only experience
with a reptilian being?

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know who these
other beings that are friendly,

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:84%
but they identify
themselves as Saurian,

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.060 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily reptilian.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So I guess reptilian-like
in the sense

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.550 align:middle line:84%
that they were more
humanoid than reptilian.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:84%
They may have had reptilian
ancestry in their bloodline.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:47.170 align:middle line:90%
Or Some sort of hybrid maybe.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Perhaps.

00:27:48.485 --> 00:27:49.285 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps.

00:27:49.285 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>> During your time at the CIA,
can you tell us your exposure

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.245 align:middle line:84%
related to refers and
extraterrestrial intelligence?

00:27:56.245 --> 00:27:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:03.040 align:middle line:84%
My official exposure was through
a briefing that I received.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And this briefing
was very unusual

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:10.060 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't a formal
official briefing in the sense

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.910 align:middle line:84%
that it was held in
a classified space.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:18.790 align:middle line:10%
This was held in a hotel room
in Tysons Corner, Virginia.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:23.150 align:middle line:10%
And I was invited to this
meeting in an unclassified

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:28.010 align:middle line:10%
conference room at the
hotel by an individual who

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:10%
was a member of
the science office

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.240 align:middle line:10%
and the directorate of
science and technology.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And this individual
knew of my interest

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:84%
in the entire field
of UFOs and ETs.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a, I guess you
would call it a plush toy,

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial gray except it
was green with the almond eyes.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And I could bend this toy
into a seating position,

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and I used to set
him on my monitor.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.010 align:middle line:90%
And so he knew I was interested.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.827 align:middle line:84%
He invited me to
a meeting saying

00:29:02.827 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that, I might be interested
in the subject matter,

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.930 align:middle line:84%
but you didn't tell
me what it was.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:11.460 align:middle line:84%
It's unclassified and go to this
hotel room or hotel conference

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.260 align:middle line:90%
room.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.340 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to the
hotel, I went into the room

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.460 align:middle line:90%
with absolutely no security.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.720 align:middle line:84%
There was no security
officer checking badges.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I could carry my cell phone in,
which is unheard of in a skiff.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:29.120 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a skiff sighting.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>> No badge check, no security
check, cell phones allowed.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So right there, I knew that
it's going to be an unclassified

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.280 align:middle line:90%
talk or a briefing.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what the
subject matter was.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I signed my name into
the sign in sheet.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that the other
people attending had .edu

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.670 align:middle line:90%
as part of their email address.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:84%
So I knew they
were from academia.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And I noticed that--

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I looked around the room
and there were two officers

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:90%
that I recognized personally.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.920 align:middle line:84%
One was the officer who
invited me to the meeting,

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and another was a senior officer
in the Office of Scientific

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.740 align:middle line:90%
and Weapons Research.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I took my seat and
they handed out the agenda.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I looked on the
agenda, and there

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.360 align:middle line:84%
is what I saw that the
first item on the agenda

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:25.670 align:middle line:84%
would be a talk by the history
staff about CIA's involvement

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:29.420 align:middle line:90%
with refers going back to 1947.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the members
of the history staff

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:38.580 align:middle line:84%
got up to talk about have
photos going back to 1947,

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.960 align:middle line:90%
CIA's involvement with it.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.125 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that
after Roswell,

00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:47.620 align:middle line:84%
when we were definitely
involved with UFOs,

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:51.790 align:middle line:84%
we had a study program
dealing with UFOs.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And that was separate
from Project Blue Book.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Project Blue Book was Air Force.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.030 align:middle line:90%
This was an internal CIA study.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:05.430 align:middle line:10%
And that it really
ramped up in 1952

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:10%
when there were objects flying
over the skies of Washington

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:10%
D.C.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, was this different than
what the public was receiving

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:18.310 align:middle line:84%
as far as the news on and
education on UFOs and ETs

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:19.110 align:middle line:90%
at that time?

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Did you notice this was
something that was just

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.920 align:middle line:90%
the first time you heard of?

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, I knew some
of the background already

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:30.930 align:middle line:84%
because the history
staff published a report

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
on CIA's involvement in
refers from 1947 to 1990.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I read the classified
version of that.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.570 align:middle line:84%
What was released to the public
was unclassified, of course.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So it built upon that,
but still unclassified.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And so in 1952, CIA he came
forward with a study panel

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.540 align:middle line:84%
to go forward and
actually study this.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's not none of the
panels that you've heard of.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not the Robertson
panel or Condon panel.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:90%
This was internal to CIA.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was conducted
by the Office

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:14.870 align:middle line:84%
of Scientific Intelligence,
which was created in 1949.

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And that office was actually
created prior to that.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.370 align:middle line:84%
During the time of
Roswell, this office

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:26.300 align:middle line:84%
was called the Office of
Research and Estimates.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And inside that office was the
scientific intelligence branch,

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.880 align:middle line:90%
which had the UFO portfolio.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And that scientific
intelligence branch

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:41.570 align:middle line:84%
became an office on its own
with many other divisions

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:46.070 align:middle line:84%
within it, one of them
being life sciences, physics

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:90%
and electronics division.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And there was another
division as well,

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.420 align:middle line:84%
three divisions
dealing with equipment,

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:84%
scientific equipment,
technical equipment

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:84%
that all had some aspect
of the UFO portfolio.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.430 align:middle line:84%
What interest me
was life sciences

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:10.880 align:middle line:84%
because the other
divisions were more

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:84%
into the physics side of things,
the science side of things,

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:18.380 align:middle line:84%
the aeronautical engineering
side of things, if you will.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But life sciences is
all about biology.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.990 align:middle line:84%
It's about physiologists, it's
about neurologists, physicians,

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:31.970 align:middle line:84%
medical professionals inside
working in that division.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Why would they be--

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Why would that be there?

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Unless they were actually
recovered bodies that they were

00:33:38.265 --> 00:33:39.065 align:middle line:90%
studying.

00:33:39.065 --> 00:33:40.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Were there?

00:33:40.782 --> 00:33:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> That was in part
2 of that meeting.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So I did learn that CIA knew
about the UFO phenomenon,

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:53.190 align:middle line:90%
that it was a real phenomenon.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And Project Blue Book did
its thing for the Air Force.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.200 align:middle line:84%
They went ahead and
did their thing,

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:03.350 align:middle line:84%
but CIA earnestly studied
internally the UFO phenomenon

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:84%
to the point that
when the U-2 spy

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.940 align:middle line:84%
plane was being developed
at Area 51, which

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.409 align:middle line:90%
we didn't call area 51.

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:15.830 align:middle line:84%
It was actually called
Station D as in delta.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:16.940 align:middle line:90%
It was called The Ranch.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.080 align:middle line:90%
That was its nickname.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.120 align:middle line:10%
The U-2 was actually
silver, and it

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.580 align:middle line:10%
would fly on a flight
path well known,

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.590 align:middle line:10%
already preplanned in advance.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.719 align:middle line:84%
And all along that
flight path, people

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:30.330 align:middle line:90%
would start reporting UFOs.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA knew, OK,
that's our U-2 spy plane.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.830 align:middle line:84%
It will silver,
not black, silver.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.790 align:middle line:90%
And it was flown in daylight.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Why daylight?

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Because it had cameras, and
they needed to test the cameras.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And back then, we didn't
have fancy infrared cameras.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.239 align:middle line:84%
They needed optical
photography, sunlight.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So we flew them there in
daylight and they were silver.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And when we developed
A-12, the follow on,

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:84%
which was the precursor to
the SR-71, it was also silver.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And again, on its flight paths,
people started reporting UFOs.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, 10% of these reports
could not be accounted for

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.030 align:middle line:90%
according to the history staff.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:23.530 align:middle line:90%
10% were actual UFOs.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And the history
staff person then

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:90%
showed a picture of a real UFO.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:35.290 align:middle line:84%
This person put up a picture
of the McMinnville UFO,

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:38.800 align:middle line:84%
the famous photographs
taken by the Trints

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:44.050 align:middle line:84%
in McMinnville, Oregon, which
appeared in major magazines.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And the historian said
that this is a UFO.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:90%
This has never been debunked.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.860 align:middle line:84%
This is what a real one
is, and we know it's real.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And so that was very interesting
that they would say that.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.900 align:middle line:84%
This is before they
actually disclosed

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.240 align:middle line:90%
anything, way before AAWSAP.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Way before "The New
York Times" piece.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.270 align:middle line:84%
In December of 2017, I was
hearing this in an unclassified

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:14.650 align:middle line:84%
setting with other people
from academia and two CIA

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.590 align:middle line:90%
officers whom I recognized.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So the second part is about
CIA's interest in alien DNA.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And the historian
said that we had

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:84%
an interest in alien DNA
going back since World War II.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, didn't say
that they completely

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:45.676 align:middle line:84%
knew about the alien DNA genome
because that technology--

00:36:45.676 --> 00:36:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>> --didn't come around--

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>> --until the 1990s.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:54.010 align:middle line:84%
But there was an interest
in some aspect of genetics--

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:56.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:36:56.055 --> 00:37:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>> --dealing with alien DNA.

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And more profound
was that CIA was

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.710 align:middle line:84%
interested in
certain humans that

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:13.020 align:middle line:84%
may have had an enhancement
of this alien DNA.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.660 align:middle line:84%
That is to say that
basically, we're

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.420 align:middle line:90%
all aliens in some respect.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:22.770 align:middle line:84%
But some of us, some
humans have an enhancement

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.370 align:middle line:90%
of that alien DNA.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
time I ever heard that.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.210 align:middle line:84%
To me, that was the most
shocking thing I ever heard of.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:32.230 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Why were they so interested
in the DNA of extraterrestrials

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and the DNA of humans that
may contain extraterrestrials

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.505 align:middle line:84%
for maybe enhancements,
I don't know?

00:37:42.505 --> 00:37:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a
cognizance, I believe,

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.150 align:middle line:84%
within the intelligence
community, particularly CIA,

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that there are humans
among us that might be more

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.350 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial than human.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:58.810 align:middle line:90%
And how do you identify them?

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:03.610 align:middle line:84%
That could be a major factor why
they were interested in that.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
the, I guess, you

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:84%
would call contact
tracing of like who's who.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did reveal
that there was an interest

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:19.542 align:middle line:90%
in certain families.

00:38:19.542 --> 00:38:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>> How would you
understand families?

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand families
to mean bloodlines.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.125 align:middle line:84%
That they were interested in
certain bloodlines going back

00:38:28.125 --> 00:38:28.925 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:38:28.925 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Ancient times.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Who knows?

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Ancient times.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they mention other
heritages around the planet

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.040 align:middle line:90%
that threw this marker?

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I was specifically told
that the Cherokee heritage,

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.630 align:middle line:84%
the Cherokee Nation had
something to do with

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:46.010 align:middle line:90%
the phenomenon.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore,
that it has something

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:54.010 align:middle line:84%
to do with perhaps even the
actual existence of Atlantis,

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that they may have been
survivors of Atlantis.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.510 align:middle line:90%
But then I can't prove that.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:00.880 align:middle line:90%
I can't divulge a source.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I was told by a very
credible source.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And what was their take on
Atlantis since we're speaking

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.245 align:middle line:90%
about it?

00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that their
take is it's actual--

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:90%
and it's not myth and legend.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.150 align:middle line:90%
It's an actual place.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they know where it's at?

00:39:17.042 --> 00:39:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:19.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
it's at, and they

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:21.120 align:middle line:90%
didn't tell me where it's at.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But what would give them that
idea that the Cherokee heritage

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:33.770 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the Atlantean
time unless they had some sort

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:84%
of DNA to compare
it to from Atlantis?

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I think because that there
is a preponderance of people

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:47.330 align:middle line:84%
in the intelligence community
and in the military community,

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:53.620 align:middle line:84%
especially special operators
who've had these experiences.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And when they
examine these people

00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and start questioning them
about their background,

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:05.070 align:middle line:84%
about their family
heritages, that it

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:09.540 align:middle line:84%
was a preponderance of
Cherokee heritage associated

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:14.100 align:middle line:84%
with not only having
these experiences

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.135 align:middle line:90%
but with having implants.

00:40:17.135 --> 00:40:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So the suggestion of implants
means it's possibly currently

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.430 align:middle line:90%
ongoing.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it is because implants
have been recovered from

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:31.910 align:middle line:84%
people, not just those who are
in the military or intelligence

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:33.350 align:middle line:90%
community, but from others.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>> While being in
this meeting, John,

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and listening to the biology
and all the tech being presented

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:45.680 align:middle line:84%
to you and you going through
this experience already

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.950 align:middle line:84%
your whole life of these
different experiences with ET

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.138 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, what was
going through your mind?

00:40:51.138 --> 00:40:52.055 align:middle line:90%
What was your emotion?

00:40:52.055 --> 00:40:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>> My feeling was that this
was why I had those experiences

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.905 align:middle line:84%
to begin with, but
perhaps I was taken.

00:41:00.905 --> 00:41:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And I never used
the word abducted

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.240 align:middle line:90%
because I wanted to be taken.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I was only disappointed
when they brought me back.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.430 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps this
is why I was taken

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:16.590 align:middle line:84%
that I may have had this lineage
in my own family history.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.100 align:middle line:90%
What is their purpose?

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
for many, many years.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it wasn't
until 2020 that I

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:27.870 align:middle line:90%
knew what I was supposed to do.

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>> And what is that?

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is to do exactly
what I'm doing now with you,

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.900 align:middle line:84%
is to share my story and to
share my experiences with

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.250 align:middle line:84%
others who may have had
similar experiences.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And so on July of 2020,
it was my birthday.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:50.490 align:middle line:90%
There was a CE6 global session.

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was called
Harmonic Convergence 2020.

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:58.970 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I participated
in this global CE6 session.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked up and didn't
see anything for a while.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I saw this bright orb.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:11.080 align:middle line:84%
It was a white, bright
orb right in front of me

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:90%
over the mountains.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're only like
2 and 1/2 to 3 miles

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.100 align:middle line:90%
away from the mountains.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.890 align:middle line:90%
So it's above those mountains.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:20.800 align:middle line:84%
My wife saw something
simultaneously,

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.980 align:middle line:84%
but she says it's
over to my right.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.410 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, it's right ahead.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.790 align:middle line:90%
She was sitting on my right.

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:30.160 align:middle line:84%
She should have
seen it on her left.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But she saw it all
the way to her right.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:37.640 align:middle line:10%
And so I looked up and then
the message came to me.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:42.690 align:middle line:10%
And the message was, there are
things that you've learned,

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:46.190 align:middle line:10%
and it's time for you
to share what you know.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And that was in reference
to their existence,

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:51.620 align:middle line:90%
the reality of their existence.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned
through my work at CIA,

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.900 align:middle line:90%
it's time for you to share.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And sharing meaning all the
stuff that you've worked with

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:08.110 align:middle line:84%
the CIA or the exposure to
the beings and these visions?

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The work was what exposure
I had to the reality that there

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:19.000 align:middle line:84%
are craft, they're real, and
there are beings in these

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:19.800 align:middle line:90%
craft.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.080 align:middle line:84%
They're here for a
purpose, for a reason.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And that reason is not so much
to warn us of impending doom

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.870 align:middle line:84%
or anything like
that, but to remind us

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that we're stewards
of this planet

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and that we're doing a
terrible job of that.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe we
inherited the planet?

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Or do you believe there was
extraterrestrials here way

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.315 align:middle line:90%
before us that started this?

00:43:45.315 --> 00:43:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, to answer
your question,

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe we are also
extraterrestrials.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I think we were brought here
and that we forgot our origins.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And that some of
the beings that are

00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.050 align:middle line:84%
being encountered
by humans today

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.340 align:middle line:84%
have been here a
long, long time.

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And they may have had some
input into how we developed,

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and that they have our
best interests in mind.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:13.330 align:middle line:84%
But they're concerned about
the stewardship of the planet,

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.970 align:middle line:84%
that we are doing a
terrible job of taking care

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:18.070 align:middle line:90%
of their planet and our planet.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And that when we explode nuclear
weapons in our atmosphere

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:26.980 align:middle line:84%
like we did decades ago,
it not only affected us.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.060 align:middle line:90%
It affected them as well.

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why they're
so interested in us,

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.640 align:middle line:84%
especially after what we call
the nuclear age dawned upon us,

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that we now have the means
to destroy ourselves.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And by destroying ourselves,
we're also destroying them.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I think we're their children,
and that they have--

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:51.850 align:middle line:84%
like a concerned parent,
they want us to grow up,

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:53.860 align:middle line:84%
but they've given
us enough leeway

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.080 align:middle line:84%
to become cosmic
adults, if you will.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And that once we
become cosmic adults,

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:03.010 align:middle line:84%
we can then join them
in the full knowledge

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:07.060 align:middle line:84%
of our true origins
and why we're here

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.290 align:middle line:90%
and what our purpose is.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps we
can then join them

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.755 align:middle line:84%
in becoming a spacefaring
planet with them.

00:45:14.755 --> 00:45:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Very well said, John.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.160 align:middle line:84%
John, I want to thank you
for being on the show.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.590 align:middle line:90%
It was great information.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:37.000 align:middle line:90%
