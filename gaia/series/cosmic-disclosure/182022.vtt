00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hi everyone.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.310 align:middle line:90%
My name is Jay Weidner.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:10%
Today we have Tony
Rodrigues who claims

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:10%
to have been in the
Secret Space Program.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:10%
Hi Tony.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.655 align:middle line:10%
>>TONY RODRIGUES: Hey, Jay.

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:31.220 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: So far we've
learned that you

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:10%
were involved in some
trauma-based mind

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.290 align:middle line:10%
control, which apparently gave
you some psychic abilities.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Once you were in the
Secret Space Program,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.120 align:middle line:84%
you went to the moon,
and you were trained,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and then you went to Mars, where
you were fodder for like bait,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:84%
almost, for the soldiers
in a war on Mars

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle line:90%
between insectoids and humans.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: We were
a support force.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.780 align:middle line:90%
We were support soldiers.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle line:90%
We weren't trained to be--

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't a full-on soldier.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:84%
We were a support
force for there.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And from Mars, I was
shipped to Ceres Colony,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.692 align:middle line:90%
to the Ceres planetoid.

00:01:09.692 --> 00:01:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Let's talk about that.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Ceres is a planetoid that
is between Mars and Jupiter,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:84%
right on the edge of
the asteroid belt.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yes.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: How did you get to Ceres?

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: One day, an officer
came to get me out of my room

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and walked me down a completely
different set of corridors

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:84%
into a big area that
looked like a mall--

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:90%
another nice area.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was a train station.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.842 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, during the whole
time, I rode on many trains,

00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:84%
so it's hard to distinguish
one from the other.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.220 align:middle line:84%
But it was a completely
different train than anything

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:90%
I had rode before.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And when it turned on, you could
feel it lift up, and it went.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:90%
And there was a--

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So it was Maglev.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was more obvious than
anything else that I'd been on.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And then it went going, and
the people that I rode with

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.190 align:middle line:90%
were free.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't full of
military personnel.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:84%
It was full of professionals,
people that were dressed well

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and people that were interacting
in that society with authority.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:90%
And I could hear them talking.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It was just like being
in a city and listening

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.463 align:middle line:84%
to people talk about
their day-to-day business.

00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:15.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a different
part of society

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:84%
than I'd been exposed
to up until that point.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And it lifted off, and it went
into a tunnel and gained speed.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
You could feel it accelerate,
and then there was a poof,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:84%
like a there was a
feeling and then almost

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.113 align:middle line:90%
like a ringing in my ears.

00:02:29.113 --> 00:02:30.530 align:middle line:84%
There was something
that happened.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:90%
There was a shock--

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
to decelerate.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And when the door opened when we
stopped, it was another planet.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Instead of red dirt, it was gray
dirt, and they were Germans.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:84%
I was in a giant hangar
area, a big place

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:84%
the size of many gymnasiums
that it opened up into,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:90%
and there were troops.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
It was a day where everybody
was being delivered.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:90%
I saw a disc fly over--

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:90%
your straight-up chrome disc--

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:90%
The other thing--

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So you were outside.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: We were inside.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:90%
It was underground.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:90%
It was that big.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.422 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: A carrier so big that--

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: The
disc flew over us,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and there was a kind
of electrical crackle

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:90%
when it went over.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
You could feel
static electricity.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Back to the flash--

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.385 align:middle line:84%
you said you felt a shock
or electricity or what?

00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Like
a poof, a poof.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.968 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And what did you feel?

00:03:26.968 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And slightly
disoriented, a little dizzy.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: No electricity
or anything,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.898 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: No.

00:03:31.898 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:84%
It was a strange--
it was a strange--

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the train
went through a portal.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.267 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: It portaled.

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It came out
of the other side--

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: --to Ceres.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.463 align:middle line:84%
And they said on the train
over the intercom-- they said,

00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
you had to drink
water immediately

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:84%
because your electrolytes
were off-balance,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.042 align:middle line:84%
and it could be
dangerous if you didn't.

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:90%
And so we all lined up.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
They had people there
waiting, giving us water.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And the people, like I said,
that were professional people--

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:84%
they were giving them
bottles of water.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.035 align:middle line:84%
Guys like me, which there
were a handful of us--

00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I'll put a number on the guys,
maybe eight guys like me,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:90%
maybe 15.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember for sure.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
They gave us a
little cup of water.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:90%
And I remember going--

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:90%
I was swallowing.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I was dying of thirst,
and I wanted more.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But there was a line
that said, hurry up.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.688 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get over
there and line up.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.333 align:middle line:90%
It was like the old Nazi movies.

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:19.250 align:middle line:84%
There was a guy on a
podium talking in German.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:84%
There were soldiers, hundreds of
soldiers lined up in formation.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:90%
They came.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
There was a German guy
in a German uniform

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:90%
with a gun on sidearm.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And he handed us green
little pieces of paper

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.175 align:middle line:90%
with German writing on them.

00:04:34.175 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you guys
are going to take this--

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I think he called us
slaves, you slaves.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, you slaves are going
to read this when you're

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.285 align:middle line:90%
called upon, and as your best.

00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
want to read it,

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.827 align:middle line:90%
you can go right over there.

00:04:44.827 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And he pointed, and there was
a black spot on the ground.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.043 align:middle line:84%
He said, last month
we had some slaves,

00:04:50.043 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
want to read this,

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and we took them right
there, and we shot them.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Is anybody going
to get shot today?

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And we all just
sat there quietly.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say anything.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:90%
He said, good.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Now get over there in line,
and when you're called upon,

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
you're going to read this,
and when you're done,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
salute that flag.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was he speaking
in fluent English?

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: European-accented
English, yes.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So then what did you do?

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: We did
exactly we said,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:90%
and it went on for a while.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:84%
The podium guy went on talking
in German or another language--

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle line:90%
it was German, but--

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I'm a little
confused about this.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.918 align:middle line:84%
What are the Germans
doing on Ceres?

00:05:24.918 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: The Germans moved.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
They have a breakaway
civilization there.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.110 align:middle line:84%
They had about 225,000
people living there.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: On Ceres?

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.618 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: They had
about 40,000 slaves

00:05:33.618 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
like me living there in
the area that I was living.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.213 align:middle line:84%
There are two other alien
species that are living there.

00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And are you living on
the surface, or is this all--

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES:
Completely underground.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.960 align:middle line:84%
They had monitoring stations
on parts of the planet.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It might look like a weather
station that were like a rock,

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:84%
but they were watching
outside of the planet,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and they did their best
to hide their presence

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:90%
as best they could.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Inside on Ceres,
there are places

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:84%
that are called cold
traps in craters

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:90%
that never show the sun.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And they had the
entrances to their hangar,

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
the one that I went to,
there inside a cold trap.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But they had observation
posts, and they

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:84%
have satellites around Ceres
that are watching nearby.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:84%
They wanted their presence
to not be obvious, as much as

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:84%
But they had found the
caverns there first.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.030 align:middle line:84%
They had found it and
then built onto it.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.923 align:middle line:84%
They found ruins
there and moved in.

00:06:29.923 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So like the
ancient builder

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.860 align:middle line:84%
race or something had come
and built this place out,

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:90%
and then the Germans found it.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I don't know
a whole lot about that,

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:90%
but I believe so.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:90%
They kept a lot of it secret.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And there were places that I
went that still had technology

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.610 align:middle line:90%
from what they had found.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.167 align:middle line:84%
There were doors that
were mentally interacted.

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:84%
The door knew you were
there, not the person

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of the door.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And it would tell the person
on the inside of the door

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that somebody was there--
all telepathically.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.045 align:middle line:84%
And that person could make you
go away, could cause you pain,

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and make you go away if
you weren't welcome--

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.660 align:middle line:90%
or open the door.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:84%
The door itself could
literally cause pain to you.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And how is
this cavern lit?

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: There were
many different caverns.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
artificial lights.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Most of the bigger ones--

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:84%
the Germans had built European
replica buildings inside.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.158 align:middle line:84%
There was an entire
area that was a replica,

00:07:25.158 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and I might be wrong
when I say this,

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:84%
but I believe it was a
replica of Copenhagen

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.702 align:middle line:90%
inside a big natural cavern.

00:07:31.702 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And there were other
places that were connected

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.100 align:middle line:84%
that were long trapezoid-shaped
caverns that were smooth,

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and they had rows of
buildings with columns.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:90%
They were big on the--

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
it looked like
1930s, 1940s marble.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:84%
There were marble
steps everywhere.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.455 align:middle line:90%
There were columns everywhere.

00:07:50.455 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And there were narrow
streets that they

00:07:52.080 --> 00:08:00.530 align:middle line:84%
had electrical vehicles for
emergency staff or the police,

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.145 align:middle line:90%
for 911, for that.

00:08:04.145 --> 00:08:06.270 align:middle line:84%
There was a train system
that connected everything.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
walking or a train system.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And there were craft
that would go up out

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
of the gravity into the
microgravity and then fly.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.320 align:middle line:84%
There were ferries that
went into the big caverns,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:90%
and I rode one one time.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the
artificial gravity only

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:84%
went up 30 feet or so, and
you would get on a craft,

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.663 align:middle line:84%
and it had big skids that
lifted it up out of the gravity,

00:08:27.663 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and then it would float
there, and it just had

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:90%
fans, jet fans that moved it.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:90%
And it was like a tour bus.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And it
would fly, and then

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.497 align:middle line:84%
the skids would
be waiting for it,

00:08:38.497 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:84%
and it would lower back
down into the gravity, where

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.730 align:middle line:84%
the gravity range was,
and you would disembark.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they are still
using the gravity floors here

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:90%
on Ceres, too?

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And there
were miles of it.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Miles.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Miles and miles and
miles of artificial gravity--

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:84%
because Ceres itself
is only 500 miles wide,

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:84%
so it's a microgravity
environment.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.120 align:middle line:84%
There was this
alien species there

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.190 align:middle line:84%
that was about nine
feet tall, and they

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.820 align:middle line:84%
wore some kind of
jewelry, like a bracelet,

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and wherever they
went, the gravity

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:84%
turned down because our
gravity was too heavy for them.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So where they were standing
locally on that floor block,

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
the gravity would
lower for them.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So there was an
AI that was controlling

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:90%
it or regulating it?

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Or you don't know?

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And so did you
communicate with these Germans?

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: They could turn
on the translator-- on and off.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What's a translator?

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.205 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: They
had the ability

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to be talking like
we were in German,

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and they could flick a
switch, and I could understand

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.110 align:middle line:90%
what they were saying.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Like a little
machine or something?

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: No.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:90%
It was locally.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
It was built into
the area you were.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:90%
And it worked for other people.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I worked with people
that spoke Italian,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and when you were in the
local area at the door,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.195 align:middle line:84%
leaving the ship,
there was one there.

00:09:51.195 --> 00:09:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you stood
near it, the translator

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:84%
worked, or in the
elevator of the ship.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Literally, I was
outside the elevator,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and I listened to two
guys talking in German.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
We all three walked on to the
elevator, and all of a sudden,

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I could understand
what they were saying--

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:90%
like the damn thing blew apart.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.400 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't believe it.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.447 align:middle line:90%
And then they shut up.

00:10:08.447 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want me to
hear what they were saying,

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.508 align:middle line:84%
and when they got
off the elevator,

00:10:12.508 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:84%
they started talking
in German again.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:84%
It was just localized
to certain areas.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Because you were at the
American base on Mars, and then

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:84%
you were sent to
the German base,

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:90%
apparently by the Americans.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Is there an alliance?

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Sold off.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know
the political--

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:84%
but like I said, I was tested
to see what I was ideal for.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: When you were
obsolete for one task,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.220 align:middle line:84%
you would be tested and then
put in your next optimal task.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Makes sense.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: So I'm sure
they're trading resources.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.620 align:middle line:84%
All the colonies up
there-- and there's

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.287 align:middle line:84%
many, more than
anybody knows about.

00:10:48.287 --> 00:10:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So you were traded.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: They were trading
assets between each other.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't they?

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sure.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Especially if there's a
shortage of personnel.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.695 align:middle line:84%
All right, so then
what happened?

00:10:56.695 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
You're on Ceres, and you
have artificial gravity,

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:90%
and there's Germans.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Are the Germans nice to you?

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: No, absolutely not.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What are they like?

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:06.827 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Militant.

00:11:06.827 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:90%
I was a slave for them--

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.160 align:middle line:84%
the same way they would
treat slave labor here.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.570 align:middle line:90%
We did our salute.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
We read our thing
as best we could

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:84%
in German, which I had
no clue on how to do.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:84%
We had to stagger
through the words,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
thinking that I was going to
and fearing of being shot.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.238 align:middle line:84%
They made us do the--
we did that salute.

00:11:27.238 --> 00:11:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they took us to
our area where we lived,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
where I lived for the
next 11 or 12 years.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:84%
You lived 11 or
12 years on Ceres?

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a prison
with no bars, with no doors.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
It was probably a 5 by 10
with a cot and a little drawer

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.318 align:middle line:90%
next to me.

00:11:46.318 --> 00:11:47.985 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
prison cell, and there

00:11:47.985 --> 00:11:49.950 align:middle line:90%
were all guys in there.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.548 align:middle line:84%
And you could come and
go, but it took money

00:11:52.548 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:84%
to ride the trains
and get into town,

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and I had no money,
so you're stuck there.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Unless you want to
walk it, and you

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
had to be back at a certain
time, or you'd be disciplined.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.642 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So there was a town.

00:12:01.642 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: There were many.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.017 align:middle line:90%
There is a network of towns.

00:12:04.017 --> 00:12:05.970 align:middle line:84%
There were rings around
of the train stops,

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and they were
building like crazy.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:84%
From the time I got there
until the time I left,

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.450 align:middle line:84%
they added many
more train routes.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:84%
You could walk up and see
them at the train station.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So is the
population growing there?

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yes.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Real estate was a big deal.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.562 align:middle line:84%
It was the biggest
deal to them on Ceres.

00:12:21.562 --> 00:12:23.520 align:middle line:84%
They had another outpost
out in the Kuiper Belt

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.158 align:middle line:84%
where they stored--
like a warehouse--

00:12:25.158 --> 00:12:27.450 align:middle line:84%
where we would take cargo
because they didn't have room

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:28.840 align:middle line:90%
to store it on Ceres.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do the Germans have
any exotic technologies

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.717 align:middle line:84%
like life extension
or anything like that?

00:12:34.717 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: I believe so.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So these could have been like
maybe older than they appeared,

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:90%
these Germans?

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: The command crews
of the ships that I was on

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.310 align:middle line:90%
were born there.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Or they were Germans
from Ceres, and they

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
had completely
different educations.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:84%
They had a completely different
version of Earth history

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.098 align:middle line:84%
that they were educated
in than we are.

00:12:56.098 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:84%
They had a completely
different upbringing.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.588 align:middle line:84%
They had different morals, and
they believed different things.

00:13:00.588 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they were
doing selective breeding

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
arranged marriages

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:90%
for genetic advantages.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And so they believed themselves
better than everybody on Earth

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.280 align:middle line:90%
for that reason.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What is the
point of the Germans?

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:90%
What are they after?

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:15.975 align:middle line:90%
Are they after resources?

00:13:15.975 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Now, the
first ship I worked on,

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:84%
when I did repair, I had
no idea where we were going

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:90%
or what we did.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.090 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.618 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea if
we even left dock.

00:13:25.618 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:84%
We just went in the ship
and did what I was told,

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and it was Groundhog Day
for seven years, six,

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:90%
seven years, eight years.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how long.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.740 align:middle line:90%
That's how blurry that was.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It was just the same
thing every day.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:84%
But later on, I
was promoted, and I

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:84%
ended up being a
cargo engineer and put

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.940 align:middle line:84%
on a more modern ship and
advanced ship when that one was

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:90%
antiquated and fell apart.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And our mission on
that ship was purely

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:84%
to get technology from
other races, other sentient

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:90%
races in the universe.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And we went to other star
systems in the galaxy

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:90%
most of the time.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:84%
We used a natural portal
to go to other galaxies.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.938 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: We
did trade missions.

00:14:07.938 --> 00:14:09.680 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to trade
goods for tech or tech

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:84%
for tech or anything
we could for tech.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So these ships would
be parked inside Ceres,

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and then you would
get on for a mission,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.005 align:middle line:84%
and you would go out
and do something,

00:14:20.005 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and you were one
of the guys that

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.118 align:middle line:90%
kept the ship running, right?

00:14:23.118 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Well, I did cargo.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, well--

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Cargo.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Couple ships.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I was a cargo engineer
at my highest rank.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.173 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You were cargo, OK.

00:14:29.173 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle line:90%
This is later on.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So would you say what,
10 years total, then, on Ceres?

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I like to
think it's 12, 12 years.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.175 align:middle line:84%
So eight years of that
was just repair work--

00:14:39.175 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Groundhog Day.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.528 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: --on an older
ship that had submarine doors.

00:14:43.528 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And I remember whenever
we were in a hurry,

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.098 align:middle line:90%
we'd trip over the threshold.

00:14:47.098 --> 00:14:48.890 align:middle line:84%
You had to step over
it, and the newer ship

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.600 align:middle line:90%
had a shorter threshold.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:84%
The old ship had a
threshold about that big,

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and then the newer one had
a pocket door that closed,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:84%
so you didn't have
to swing it open.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And it had a smaller
threshold, so it was a breeze,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.027 align:middle line:84%
and I remember being
happy about that.

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah, the reports are are
that they were actually using

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.292 align:middle line:84%
submarines in the early days
of the Secret Space Program

00:15:08.292 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:90%
because they were perfectly--

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And that's exactly
what it looked like to me

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:90%
on the inside.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
There were pipes and
wires and things.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:90%
It was very crowded.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Could it have
come from the 1950s?

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah, we were
replacing old valves and things

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:90%
with newer equipment.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
We had auto-welding
equipment that

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exist on Earth today,
so that's an exotic technology.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Imagine a pipe, a steel pipe.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
It was a collar you'd put
around it, and it was electric.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
It would recharge in
its locker, and there

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.790 align:middle line:90%
was a canister for cutting.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And there was a rod
to feed, and all

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.458 align:middle line:84%
you had to do was program
it and turn it on,

00:15:42.458 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and it would take
about five minutes,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.217 align:middle line:84%
and it would go around
it and cut the pipe.

00:15:46.217 --> 00:15:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Then you'd move it and
cut your section out,

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and I could put a new section
there and put on the other one

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and put the broad in, and
it would perfectly weld it.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:90%
So I was a welder.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.550 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.883 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any talent at all.

00:15:56.883 --> 00:15:58.185 align:middle line:90%
It was completely automated.

00:15:58.185 --> 00:15:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you were
taking this old ship

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.412 align:middle line:90%
and trying to modernize it.

00:16:01.412 --> 00:16:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: It
had some technology

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:84%
that dealt with its maintenance,
and we were maintenance.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle line:90%
That's what we did.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It would seem to me
that if the Germans had created

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
technologies to get to
Ceres before everybody else,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and now they're
sending ships out, even

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:84%
going to other galaxies
to find technology,

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
then those Germans on Ceres must
be extremely advanced by now.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Like almost another
species or something.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I've
said in the past

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that I believe they were
more advanced technologically

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:84%
but less advanced socially,
culturally than us.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:90%
They were very oppressive.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.770 align:middle line:84%
They were very arrogant,
and they were into slavery,

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:90%
and we did illegal things.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
In the colonies in our solar
system, in the space program,

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:90%
there's a set of laws.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: They
had a set of laws,

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and we would always
talk about it.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.233 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:84%
I think one is that
they're not supposed

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.670 align:middle line:90%
to attack any other colony.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:84%
One colony cannot militarily--
couldn't, back then--

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:84%
militarily attack
another colony.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But we could attack a colony
of humans that originated

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:90%
in another star system.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Even if they were humans,
we could attack them,

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and there would
be no consequence.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:90%
But you couldn't attack.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:84%
But the Germans didn't
care about that.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:84%
There are laws about
media from Earth--

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:84%
no media should be
read from Earth.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.695 align:middle line:84%
The Germans had access to
our books, to our music.

00:17:37.695 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wait a minute.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that you guys
couldn't watch television

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.530 align:middle line:90%
from Earth or anything?

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: They had
their own television.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.530 align:middle line:84%
They had their own sports
and things up there.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.503 align:middle line:84%
I'd be in public
places in the city--

00:17:47.503 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you had
no idea what was

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:90%
going on Earth at this time.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.383 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: That's right.

00:17:51.383 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But some of the residents there
did have access to our media.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:58.460 align:middle line:90%
They did have our music.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:84%
They did have sporting events
that happened down here

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.300 align:middle line:90%
that they were watching.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's against the
law in the colonies.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And they gave zero
care about that.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:84%
The Ceres colony
corporation and the ship

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that I worked on
when I had freedom

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and I had access to
the mission briefings,

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:84%
when I was a cargo engineer,
routinely broke those laws,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.810 align:middle line:84%
routinely broke the law
between the space program--

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:90%
the solar system law.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.590 align:middle line:90%
We stole from other colonies.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.090 align:middle line:90%
We engaged other colonies.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.370 align:middle line:90%
We stole from other ETs.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.590 align:middle line:84%
It was to do anything
they could possibly

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.703 align:middle line:84%
do to get more
technology, and they

00:18:36.703 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:90%
didn't care how they did it.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.745 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And there were
no consequences for all

00:18:39.745 --> 00:18:42.013 align:middle line:90%
of this illegal activity?

00:18:42.013 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: No they got
away with most of it.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:90%
They knew what they were--

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why wouldn't
these Germans

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.155 align:middle line:84%
be planning on
taking over the Earth

00:18:51.155 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:84%
if they had this
high technology?

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.322 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: As far as
they were concerned,

00:18:54.322 --> 00:18:55.830 align:middle line:90%
the Earth is already taken over.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: By?

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.838 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: The
banks-- that they run.

00:18:58.838 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:84%
As far as they were
concerned, they already

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.922 align:middle line:84%
took over the earth, that
the Earth was an entire slave

00:19:02.922 --> 00:19:05.750 align:middle line:90%
planet to the Germans.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
referred to it, and when

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.392 align:middle line:84%
they had pictures
of the Earth, there

00:19:09.392 --> 00:19:11.000 align:middle line:90%
was always a chain around it.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.800 align:middle line:10%
The later missions we did--
whenever they needed goods from

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:23.340 align:middle line:10%
Earth, they would get military
boots or guns or Jeeps

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:10%
or whatever it was--

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:29.280 align:middle line:10%
we would go to Diego Garcia,
and there would be a couple--

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, two or three
American officers at Diego.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:10%
We would go in the
middle of the night,

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.662 align:middle line:10%
and everybody else that
was stationed there

00:19:35.662 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't know it was a secret.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:10%
But there was a landing
area, and we went there,

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:10%
and we'd wait for shipments
to come in sometimes.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.388 align:middle line:84%
We'd have to go
out to sea and wait

00:19:44.388 --> 00:19:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and then fly in and grab
cargo fast and leave.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:84%
But anytime they got military
equipment, anything-- missiles,

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:90%
anything--

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.830 align:middle line:84%
we went to Diego
Garcia and got it.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And one time, the guy
that normally signed it

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.782 align:middle line:84%
to the American officer
was with me, and he said,

00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:90%
I need somebody to sign this.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Will you sign this?

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK, I guess.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:90%
He's like, anybody can sign it.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I said,
I'm not a officer.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.282 align:middle line:90%
I'm not anything.

00:20:09.282 --> 00:20:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I did, and
he said, you guys

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.977 align:middle line:84%
are starting to get
quite a big tab,

00:20:12.977 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and he showed me some
astronomical number of money

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.897 align:middle line:90%
they owed.

00:20:15.897 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And I asked about it
in the mission briefing

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.905 align:middle line:84%
the next morning, does
anybody have anything to add?

00:20:19.905 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I would go to those
briefings in the morning.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Most of it was in German, and
when they needed my report

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:84%
on how much room was
in the cargo bay,

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.710 align:middle line:84%
they would turn
on the translator

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and go, how much room
is in Cargo Bay--

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:90%
I was in, there was a A, B, C--

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:37.015 align:middle line:84%
I was in D and E. I was in
charge of D and E cargo bays.

00:20:37.015 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:90%
But I raised my hand.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, the guy at Diego Garcia
said we're running a big tab.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.612 align:middle line:90%
Is that going to be squared up?

00:20:41.612 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:90%
And they burst into laughter.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:84%
They were crying
laughing over that,

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:84%
at me, because they
didn't pay a dime,

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:84%
because the Americans
thought that the Germans were

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:90%
paying for the goods there.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.410 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is they
just got whatever

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:84%
they wanted for free
from them because they're

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.610 align:middle line:90%
in charge anyway--

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:90%
because it's a secret--

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They're all
part of the same group.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: --administration,
right, and our black budget

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
dollars are covering
those goods.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.035 align:middle line:84%
We would go there, like I said,
in the middle of the night.

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I remember one time we
were waiting on cargo,

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:90%
and it was late.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:90%
There was a ship coming late.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.612 align:middle line:84%
So there's a place called
Turtle Bay or Turtle Cove,

00:21:17.612 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and we would go over there,
and they would drop a cargo net

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.362 align:middle line:90%
down, and we could go swimming.

00:21:21.362 --> 00:21:23.680 align:middle line:84%
They let us take a
break and go swimming.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And the ship that we
were on was hard-capped

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:90%
at 10 meters above any object.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So it was always about
30 feet above whatever,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:90%
wherever we were.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:90%
It couldn't go lower.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:34.955 align:middle line:90%
It was always flying.

00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
a big cargo net,

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and I remember this
because I went swimming.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.450 align:middle line:84%
I thought, great, I'm going
to go swimming in the ocean.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And I went swimming down there,
and it was a big deal to me

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:84%
because I was with the
crew that was free.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.380 align:middle line:90%
I was a slave.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.910 align:middle line:84%
But I got tired going up the
cargo net, and one of the crew

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.210 align:middle line:84%
saw me struggling, and I was
winded when I got to the top,

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.710 align:middle line:84%
30 feet up, of climbing a
cargo net, and he reported me.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to get PT
for three months, 90 days.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I had to go and
run every morning

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.355 align:middle line:84%
and exercise to get back in
shape, and it was just brutal.

00:22:09.355 --> 00:22:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: All because
you were struggling.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.563 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah,
I was out of shape.

00:22:12.563 --> 00:22:14.405 align:middle line:90%
And so I never did that again.

00:22:14.405 --> 00:22:15.280 align:middle line:90%
We could go swimming.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.005 align:middle line:84%
I'd go down there and wave
at everybody and hang out,

00:22:18.005 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:84%
but I would never
go in the water

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want to
go up that cargo net again.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So your ships would leave
Ceres, come to the earth,

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.790 align:middle line:84%
land at Diego Garcia at night so
no one could see you, I guess,

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:30.968 align:middle line:90%
load up--

00:22:30.968 --> 00:22:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Or drop off.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Or drop off.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.670 align:middle line:90%
And what would you drop off?

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: We took so many
different forms of cargo.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:84%
We did 50-gallon barrels,
drums of something.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.220 align:middle line:84%
We did big crates
of wooden crates.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:90%
We did cardboard.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.800 align:middle line:84%
We did graphite, high-tech
looking graphite boxes,

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.820 align:middle line:90%
on and on and on.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:90%
We took whatever it was.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And we had loader
systems that would drop,

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.920 align:middle line:90%
and we would grab cargo.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Were they mining?

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: On Ceres,
they were mining.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.418 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah, let's
talk about that.

00:23:02.418 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: My
first day there, I

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.640 align:middle line:90%
checked into the area I lived.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:84%
There is a buzzer
that would go off,

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and all the lights
would come on.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you went
to a train station.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.078 align:middle line:84%
Right outside the
door was a train stop.

00:23:13.078 --> 00:23:14.370 align:middle line:90%
And they say, house will be on.

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:15.645 align:middle line:84%
I asked the guy--
there was a security,

00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:16.728 align:middle line:90%
and I said, where do I go?

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:90%
He said, follow them.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.732 align:middle line:84%
And I got on the train,
and I went to the mines,

00:23:21.732 --> 00:23:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, this is wrong.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been trained
to mine anything.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.140 align:middle line:90%
It was a mistake.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And they were like, shut up.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.380 align:middle line:84%
When I said something
to the security,

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.260 align:middle line:84%
they said, shut up and go
back there and go with them,

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
you're going to be.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.560 align:middle line:90%
This is your life.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Get in there.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And they had some
high-tech mining stuff.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:45.460 align:middle line:84%
They had a beam tool that
would just blow the wall out,

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and it would be in
the microgravity.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.460 align:middle line:84%
They would go in
there and shoot it,

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.565 align:middle line:84%
and then two guys would
go in microgravity

00:23:50.565 --> 00:23:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and scoop the
stuff out, and then

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:84%
a crew guys would come
and lay that floor,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.290 align:middle line:84%
the artificial gravity
plating floor--

00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:58.090 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:90%
It was impressive.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So I asked-- it was all
the same kind of material.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.648 align:middle line:90%
It was all the same stuff.

00:24:03.648 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
are we doing with this?

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:90%
And they would take it out.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.357 align:middle line:90%
Then they would come--

00:24:07.357 --> 00:24:13.173 align:middle line:84%
there was a cart or an electric
truck that looked like a cart

00:24:13.173 --> 00:24:14.590 align:middle line:84%
that they would
load up and clean.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And what are they mining?

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Nothing.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Nothing.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: They were
looking for water.

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Ah.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: They wanted water.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.422 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what are we mining?

00:24:22.422 --> 00:24:24.338 align:middle line:84%
They said that it all
gets used for something.

00:24:24.338 --> 00:24:26.370 align:middle line:84%
They were turning it into
concrete or whatever,

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:90%
but everything got used.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:84%
But they said, we're
looking for water.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what if we
break into water, and it comes?

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.032 align:middle line:90%
We're going to drown.

00:24:32.032 --> 00:24:33.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, but
that's what they want.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:84%
They had stations set up in
the mine that would close off.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.660 align:middle line:84%
They had they had set up system
that would seal off everything.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was far away.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I went
in, the system to seal off

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.950 align:middle line:84%
was a great distance
away-- a hundred yards,

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.030 align:middle line:90%
a few hundred yards back.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you
accidentally got put

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.220 align:middle line:90%
on this mining crew for one day.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: One day.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.877 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah, and you got
to see all this cool stuff.

00:24:54.877 --> 00:24:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: The security, when
I got back to where I lived,

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.940 align:middle line:90%
were there to discipline me.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: They thought--

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I was going to get shot
or killed, whatever.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:90%
I was in big trouble.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, no.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:90%
He told me to get on the train.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And they said, OK, and
they set them straight.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.685 align:middle line:84%
There was a mix-up, a
wrinkle on their end.

00:25:12.685 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So the next morning, I went
through the same thing,

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and they explained why I
had a different outfit.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I went
to the hangar bay

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and had my first
day on the ship,

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.135 align:middle line:90%
and that's how that worked.

00:25:20.135 --> 00:25:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So one of the things
that viewers are going to wonder

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.480 align:middle line:84%
is why you are doing
low-level maintenance

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:84%
when they can
easily hire a robot

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.188 align:middle line:90%
or build a robot to do it.

00:25:30.188 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I've been asked
the same thing many times,

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and my answer is, people
are the best robot.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I went from a mine
to working there

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:84%
to being on the ship where
I was trained to doing cargo

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:90%
where I was trained.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.120 align:middle line:84%
That's three different robots
you would have to build.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:50.600 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is it's not
like they paid for health care,

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.070 align:middle line:90%
or they paid for the food.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.960 align:middle line:84%
They had food-replicating
technology.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.670 align:middle line:90%
It was free.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:84%
They just needed a
room to put us in,

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.060 align:middle line:90%
and they could put us back in--

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.102 align:middle line:84%
the main thing that they
beat us up over the head

00:26:01.102 --> 00:26:03.295 align:middle line:84%
with constantly
when you said this,

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:84%
when we were treated inhumanely,
was that don't worry, it's OK.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.990 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
remember, anyway.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.430 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to remember.

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So they could do
whatever they want.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Why would you do that?

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
A robot takes more
energy, is inefficient.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Well, Tony.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Thanks a lot.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Your story is
amazing, and I want

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:middle line:90%
to thank you all for watching.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:10%
>>Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:10%
with government agencies, the
military, and secret space

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.670 align:middle line:10%
programs.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They have their
own atmosphere, too.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they have a
different kind of atmosphere.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Fear is an
incredible motivator

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.640 align:middle line:84%
to get people to move forward
to embrace technology.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: They
took my spark of life

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
or my consciousness out of
me and put me in that clone.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:27:02.656 align:middle line:90%
