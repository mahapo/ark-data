we have John Lear.

We're talking about reverse
engineered aerospace

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:10%
John, I've been privy to a
lot of classified information

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.240 align:middle line:10%
working in the
projects at Los Alamos,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.189 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't work
for Los Alamos.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:84%
It was more of a
compartmentalized corporations

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.105 align:middle line:84%
were renting these areas
underneath Los Alamos.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was more of
a protection factor.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
The same thing was
Sandia Labs even

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:84%
though I was active duty
and working moonlighting

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:90%
jobs for these corporations.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was privy to see
some of the libraries

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that they had under there that
were showing the real craft

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.090 align:middle line:90%
and also reproduction craft.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
What do you think that you
guys saw up there at Groom Lake

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle line:84%
that night or do you--
have you had any experience

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
or know of anyone that
has confirmed that they

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:84%
do have both of
those types of crafts

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:90%
possibly stored down there?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.800 align:middle line:10%
>> JOHN LEAR: Well, Bob told
us that they were going to test

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:10%
the alien craft that night.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
he thinks we saw.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Because of the way
it moved, he thought

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
it's gotta be alien
craft, because we

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:90%
don't have that technology.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:84%
That's what we
were trying to do.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Bob's job was to
back engineer to see

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:84%
if we could get that technology,
but we didn't have it yet.

Good luck.

>> SMITH: Did he ever tell
you how they flew these craft,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
anything other than
the operational?

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: He told me in detail
how the antimatter reactor

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:90%
worked.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.180 align:middle line:84%
But as far as flying it,
he didn't know anything,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
because we couldn't
see the guy inside.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
We just know that when
Bob saw it flying,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
the guy that was
standing next to him

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
had a simple
RadioShack transceiver,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and he was talking
to the guy inside.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And Bob mentioned it seemed
like a breach of security,

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:90%
because anybody--

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: [LAUGHING]

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Could listen
on that frequency,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:84%
because it's not frequency and
it's not frequency hopping.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:84%
But apparently they
didn't care and they

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:90%
didn't think it was a problem.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So while
working on these projects,

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I was privy to this library
that did show craft and reverse

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
engineer craft and real craft
that they had obtained either

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:84%
from shooting it down or
from space or however.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.465 align:middle line:84%
And it would show
everything about the inside

00:03:25.465 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
of the craft, the
outside of the craft,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
but they never discussed the
propulsion unit and things

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I know they're
trans-dimensional craft.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I know they can create their own
gravitational field around them

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to make them do these 90
degree turns at Mach 7.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And I know you had heard
from Bob and others

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.010 align:middle line:84%
about the reverse
engineering of that.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And you also know how
that actually works,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and I like that
poster you had earlier

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
that shows that maybe you
could discuss that for us

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.283 align:middle line:90%
and show that poster.

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: This is the
antimatter reactor,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and this is where it sits
in the middle of the craft.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
I drew these to better
explain what Bob told me

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:90%
how the craft worked.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is the craft.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And the little orange spot is
where the antimatter reactor

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
These are the
gravity amplifiers.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
they shoot protons

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.553 align:middle line:84%
into the 115, which
bumps it up to 116.

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: 116, all right.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Which shows
off the antimatter,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
which is mixed with matter and
through a thermionic generator

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:90%
creates voltage out of each.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
They then take-- they're able to
grasp the gravity A wave, which

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:84%
is available as the 116
is going back to 115.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to
take it through the--

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:84%
up to the center of the
craft and down to the sides

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.787 align:middle line:90%
and into the gravity amplifiers.

00:05:04.787 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So it's
going up and around.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Right.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And focus on a point in
space and then increase

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
the attractiveness
of the amplifiers,

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:84%
increase the
amplification that pulls

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:90%
that space towards the craft.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
It wraps around the craft,
and then they turn it up,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and they're instantly hundreds
of thousands of miles away.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I think the recharge
rate is 12 milliseconds.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So they can do that
every 12 milliseconds.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.567 align:middle line:84%
So you can go a long, long ways
in a minute, much less an hour.

00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, I mean, we
see this with the air traffic

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:84%
controllers all the time
tracking these things all over

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's just no way you
can blip in and blip out,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:90%
but that's how it is.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.100 align:middle line:84%
They're going from point A to
point C and they're skipping B.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Right.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And the stories we
hear about going

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:90%
to the moon in 20 minutes.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of that is just
accelerating and decelerating.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Because they can do
it in an instant.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I think you
have a model too of this,

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:84%
if you would like to
show, which would be nice.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:90%
We can put that back.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: This shows a craft
and the distance in represented

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.462 align:middle line:90%
by that--

00:06:31.462 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Fabric
of time and space.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Fabric of space pulling
it toward you with the gravity

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:84%
amplifiers and wrapping it
around the craft like that.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they turn off
the gravity amplifiers.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Then you snap back.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:90%
You don't actually snap back.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.560 align:middle line:84%
You are back to where you
withdrew that space from.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
There is no traveling
or anything like that.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:84%
You are back there where you
withdrew that space from.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's no feeling
of motion or anything.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, because you're
in your own field of density.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Right.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: And you have the--

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:84%
also, John, I love the
model here that you have.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Emery, this is an exact
replica of a antimatter reactor

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.670 align:middle line:84%
that runs the ET craft,
only its half size.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:90%
It obviously doesn't work.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But this half sphere
comes off like this.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And inside we have a little
container with a cap on it.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, the cap comes off,
and in it we have the 115.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, the 115, we were given
500 pounds of it by ET.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And some of it they made into
these little triangles, fuel.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
But most of it they
used for a bomb,

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:84%
because they figured out
they could make a bomb

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:84%
to blow up half the side
of the continent of South

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
America, which would be
more useful to them than,

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I think, something to
create energy from nothing.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: How much energy
could you tell me is in that,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:90%
in that one piece?

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Bob told me,
and I can't remember,

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:22.335 align:middle line:84%
but it was something in the
60 megatons of energy in that.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So we could power
the planet for like two years

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.510 align:middle line:90%
on this thing.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Yeah, easy.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.480 align:middle line:84%
The real 115 is
about two inches.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:90%
I've actually held the real one.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Bob managed to get three pieces.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:84%
And we had three
for a little while.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.850 align:middle line:84%
The government stole
two of them back.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:90%
And there's one remaining.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
We did an experiment with
it, and then he hid it.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.436 align:middle line:84%
And there's only two people on
the face of this planet that

00:08:48.436 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:90%
know where it is.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.953 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Locked in a box up
in the mountains somewhere.

00:08:50.953 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Me and Bob.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.530 align:middle line:90%
And so what this does is--

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and incidentally, this lasts
about 200 years fuel provision.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is this
is a little tube that they

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:84%
shoot protons out,
which hits the 115

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:90%
at the very tip like that.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And what it does,
the 115 creates

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
116, which instantaneously
decays and throws off

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.730 align:middle line:84%
antimatter and access
to the gravity A wave.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:84%
The antimatter is
mixed with matter

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:84%
through a thermionic
generator to make electricity

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.460 align:middle line:90%
to run the ship.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And the anti-- and
the gravity A wave

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:84%
is used for the
gravity amplifiers

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.840 align:middle line:84%
under the ship to pull
space towards them.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%
The space is pulled
towards them,

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.500 align:middle line:84%
which allows the craft to be
engulfed in its own field.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: The gravity generators
pull space towards it,

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:90%
wraps around the ship.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
They turn it off,
and they're instantly

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:90%
100 million miles away.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.933 align:middle line:90%
Not feeling travel or anything.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, they're in
their own field of density.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.535 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: That's right.

00:10:03.535 --> 00:10:04.170 align:middle line:90%
They travel.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.545 align:middle line:84%
They're making
their own gravity.

00:10:05.545 --> 00:10:08.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why they can make
these Mach 7 90 degree turns.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Yep, I've seen this, some
demonstrations in the projects,

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and I was always wondering
how they were able to do this.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: To prove the
attractive properties of 115,

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:84%
we got a bell jar and
a piece of dry ice.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:90%
We put to dry ice.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And what we did is from the
top of the bell jar inside,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:84%
we hung a piece of thorium,
which we get from a Coleman

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:90%
lantern, which is unbelievable.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But we got it from
a Coleman lantern

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and hung it over the 115, which
was on top of the dry ice.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And what it was-- what the
dry ice did was create a fog,

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and we could watch the alpha
rays shooting out of thorium

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.067 align:middle line:90%
and see if it attracted.

00:10:59.067 --> 00:11:00.150 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough, they did.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
They would be pulled down into
the 115, which is obviously

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:90%
proves that everything is true.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we
lost the videotape.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:84%
There were two copies, one
that Bob had that was stolen,

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.480 align:middle line:84%
one that George Knapp
had, and they both

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:90%
lost their sets of copies.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's no way to prove
that, but I was there

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.805 align:middle line:90%
when it happened, and I saw it.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: You saw it.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think took
these files from you?

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what organization
or I'm sure your home has

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.867 align:middle line:90%
been broken into many times.

00:11:30.867 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Many times.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I do know that one day when
the phone company was called,

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Santel, my daughters
were teenagers,

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
always having something
done to their phones.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And I knew this Intel guy that
had all the training and stuff.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And he came in
one day to my den.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, John, your
phone's tapped.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah,
that's what I figured.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you mind if I check
and see where it's tapped.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:90%
I said, help yourself.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So he came back a
half an hour later.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've been down
Monroe, down Hollywood

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:84%
to Bonanza and
Bonanza to Nellis,

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.052 align:middle line:90%
and it's further than that.

00:12:07.052 --> 00:12:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, don't
worry about it,

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.260 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing
I can do about it.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, I want to find out.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.445 align:middle line:84%
So he comes the next
morning, knock on the door.

00:12:14.445 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, John, I can't work
on your phones anymore.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:90%
I said, why not?

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I traced your tap
to the mainframe and there's

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:90%
no paperwork to go with it.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And I went to my boss and she
said, either you keep quiet

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:84%
or you can find
another place to work.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Wow.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: And so he
says, I'm keeping quiet.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Direct confirmation.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: He wanted to keep
his job, which I understood.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And I saw him
occasionally years later.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
But he made it plainly
clear that he was not

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:90%
going to risk his job.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.100 align:middle line:84%
It was nice though he tried
to figure it out for you.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Yeah.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: With these
new technologies,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:84%
which are really old
technologies for us,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, when
do you think--

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:84%
do you see this ever coming
out and being utilized

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
for the world, the general
public at all as far

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.500 align:middle line:90%
as energy concerns?

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Instead of using
gas, coal, and oil,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:84%
we could be using thorium and
all these other different types

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:90%
of devices, as you know.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: It's all there.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.170 align:middle line:84%
We can't duplicate it, but
they can give it to us.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:25.410 align:middle line:84%
For instance, to imagine
a matter antimatter

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
reaction inside that
little cup there, come on.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:84%
There's other ways to
create anti-gravity.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: But this is
energy, as I see it.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: In my opinion,
no, it'll never come out.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:84%
There's the basic agreement
between our government

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and ET is we get that
advanced technology,

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
but we have to have their
help in covering it up,

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:84%
no matter if they have
to lie or make stuff up.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:84%
The deal is you can
have the technology,

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:90%
but you have to give--

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.047 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep our
existence a secret.

00:14:04.047 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: And why is that?

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:84%
What agenda do
they have for that?

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Because they are
the ones that made us.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.680 align:middle line:90%
They dreamed us up.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:90%
They engineered us.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:90%
They built us.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:90%
They put us down on Earth.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:84%
They make 100 billions
of earths just like this,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and they use the same
story to bring people

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:84%
together and understand that
what they're trying to create

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.100 align:middle line:84%
is the humans, when they
first become humans,

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to live with
integrity, without envy,

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
without hate, without
greed, and to learn

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:84%
to express our love to our
families each and every day.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:90%
That's all we're here for.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Kind of like an
experiment, an emotional,

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.180 align:middle line:84%
psychological experiment to
see if we can evolve without

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:90%
destroying.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Are they worried about
us destroying the planet?

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: No.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:84%
They take great care to be
sure that not only can we

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.670 align:middle line:84%
not destroy the planet,
there's no chance

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:84%
of an asteroid ever
hitting the planet.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:90%
We're not the only ones.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
There's billions of
other civilizations

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:90%
that they're engineering.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not an experiment.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
It just takes a
long time from when

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
a human is born with a soul to
educate and mature that soul.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.923 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things
that have to happen.

00:15:25.923 --> 00:15:26.723 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I agree.

00:15:26.723 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Basically, when we
come to Earth, we've already,

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:84%
you and I have both lived maybe
200 or 300 lives before this.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we come
here, we're down here

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.503 align:middle line:84%
to learn more about
[INAUDIBLE] obviously,

00:15:42.503 --> 00:15:43.920 align:middle line:84%
we didn't make it
the second time.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: We're still in school.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: We're here now.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:84%
When we pass away,
within about 12 seconds,

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
we are entered into
this huge, huge lobby.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
I can describe it

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.460 align:middle line:84%
is to tell you when
Steve Jobs passed away,

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
his whole family
was around his bed.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And when he had 10 seconds more
to live because of his blood

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.450 align:middle line:84%
pressure and heart
beat and everything,

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.720 align:middle line:90%
he kind of raised up.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.910 align:middle line:90%
He says, oh wow.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh wow.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh wow.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And what he was seeing
was this fantastic lobby

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:90%
that we go into.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And in this lobby, you're met
by whoever you believe in.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
You believe in God, if
you believe in Allah.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:90%
For me it's the great pumpkin.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.125 align:middle line:90%
The great pumpkin will meet me.

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And they take you and they
introduce you to or reintroduce

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:84%
you to many of the friends that
you've met over the past 200

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:90%
or 300 lives that you've lived.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And after about 30 minutes of
that, you go to a life review.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And life review is
a room where they

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle line:84%
show you every
single millisecond

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
of your life in three
dimensional color with Dolby

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:90%
sound.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing you can deny.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:90%
Every loving thing you ever did.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
And then they show you every
nasty thing you ever did.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:12.089 align:middle line:84%
Most people can't believe that
they know those secret things

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:13.829 align:middle line:90%
they'd get in.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And based on whether the good
outweighs the bad that they

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:84%
did, if the bad outweighs,
they gotta come back to Earth

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.540 align:middle line:90%
and live another life.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Or you get to stay there, which
is the fourth dimension, which

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.620 align:middle line:84%
we call heaven, but
it's a misnomer,

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:84%
because if you take
your concept of heaven

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and multiply it
exponentially by 1,000,

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
you may be close to
how fantastic it is.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And people would pay
a lot more attention

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:84%
if they knew what
was waiting for them

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.090 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth dimension.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:49.740 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the way it works.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:90%
It has to happen by itself.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:90%
There can't be allure to it.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Mm-hmm.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, with all the
on Earth and them

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
seeing us cut each
other's heads off,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:84%
is this something that
they're just watching

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and we have to become a little
bit more compassionate and more

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle line:84%
integrous with ourselves
to get to that level

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.450 align:middle line:90%
to the fourth dimension?

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Everything
is planned, Emery.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:84%
There isn't anything
that happens by accident.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Accident or whatever.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:84%
They say is it's planned from
the very beginning, including

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:90%
when you die.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And who made this
deal with the extraterrestrials?

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.225 align:middle line:84%
What government or what
society or organization?

00:18:39.225 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Well, there's
several stories,

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.558 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if
we'll ever know them.

00:18:42.558 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:10%
Of course, Eisenhower
was the first one

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:10%
that they met in
1954 at what was then

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:10%
Muroc Air Force Base, which
became Edwards Air Force Base.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.940 align:middle line:84%
It's my understanding
that Eisenhower

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.700 align:middle line:84%
asked for a weapons
technology and they

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:90%
said, no, you can't have any.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Then in 1963, there was
a meeting at Alamogordo,

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and that could have been
another request or agreement.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where
the agreement came.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:84%
They said that part
of the agreement

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:84%
was that we allowed the ETs
to only take a certain number,

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
abduct only a certain
number of humans.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And they would give us a
list of who they abducted.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Which is, of course, BS.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:90%
They abduct 100% of humans.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And we all go to
the laboratories

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:39.090 align:middle line:84%
in the moon for whatever
they do to get upgrades,

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:43.720 align:middle line:84%
to get software increases,
all kinds of stuff up there.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:84%
But both my granddaughter and
grandson have been to the moon.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:90%
And I remember my--

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Through abduction?

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Through abduction.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I remember my granddaughter,
her mother telling me

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
when she was three that she had
told her mother that the space

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:90%
people came last night.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:90%
And how many were there?

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:90%
She said five.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four, five.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And then when she was eight
living up there in Sun Valley,

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:21.430 align:middle line:84%
my two daughters, the
mother of this granddaughter

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and her sister, were sitting
in the afternoon talking

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:90%
on the couch.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that an
hour and a half had gone by

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
and they had not realized
where the granddaughter had

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:90%
come, where she was.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they heard
the back door open.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:90%
She comes in.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:84%
She has a swim mask, snorkel,
a headset, and a backpack,

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and there's a sheen
across her forehead.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And she says, they said,
where have you been?

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I've
just been to the moon.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm very tired.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.525 align:middle line:84%
I'm going upstairs
to take a nap.

00:21:02.525 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:90%
And she stomped upstairs.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Three years later,
she's at my mom's house

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
jumping on the trampoline
and asked her mother,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:84%
mom, when am I going
back to the moon?

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:22.500 align:middle line:84%
A few, let's see,
eight, seven years ago,

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:84%
my grandson, who used to live
here, came racing in that door.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.668 align:middle line:84%
He said, grandpa, I've
just been to the moon.

00:21:31.668 --> 00:21:33.510 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about it.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.005 align:middle line:84%
And I'd not discussed with
them specifically anything--

00:21:39.005 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm in my tree
house with two of my friends.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:84%
The air turns green,
and all of a sudden,

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm laying on a silver gurney
type thing getting operated on

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:90%
by an alien.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how do you
know it was the moon?

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:90%
He said, well, I don't.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:90%
I just think it was the moon.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what did
the surgeon look like?

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I said, better yet,
let me give you some drawings.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I showed him the one
of the praying mantis.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's it.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:10%
But I had him draw one.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:10%
It is very accurate, hairy
thing with a praying mantis.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:10%
Just it's really a good drawing.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.763 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't heard anything
since then, but both of them.

00:22:31.763 --> 00:22:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: What was
going on there?

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Were they getting fixed or
upgraded or what do you think?

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Or did they say?

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Absolutely every single
human being on the face of this

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:50.220 align:middle line:84%
planet gets abducted for
either upgrades or whatever.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.440 align:middle line:90%
Most of them do not remember.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why they
let my granddaughter

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:90%
or grandson remember.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:84%
There are no
explanations for that,

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.770 align:middle line:90%
because most people don't.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
people to remember.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I've heard
of different types of scalar

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:10.260 align:middle line:84%
interferometry and, of course,
mind erasing technology.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Very familiar with
all these things.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't they just
utilize frequencies and--

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:84%
because every-- if
you've been to an airport

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.520 align:middle line:84%
or if you've been to a bus
station or through a traffic

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:84%
light with a camera, they
have everyone's frequency

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:84%
logged in like a
fingerprint on the planet,

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:84%
as far as I know, especially
in the United States.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I know the ETs have a similar
system to track someone

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:84%
or to know someone where
they can actually, I mean,

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:84%
if we can do it, I
know they can do it,

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that they can send down a
signal and make you do something

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:84%
that you normally wouldn't
do that would harm someone

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
or implant a memory in you
that really didn't happen.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Are you aware of these types of?

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Yeah, well at first,
before they did the abductions,

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.800 align:middle line:84%
they started with
the, excuse me, ma'am.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind coming to the
moon and laying on his gurney

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:84%
while we operate on you,
an alien operates on you?

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.120 align:middle line:84%
They tried that,
and it didn't work.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.390 align:middle line:84%
So the best thing to do was
just to abduct him and take them

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.190 align:middle line:90%
up there.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:18.210 align:middle line:84%
They know where everybody is at
all times, much more accurate

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:90%
than we do.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: In your opinion,
how many other earth

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.810 align:middle line:84%
that's actually evolved at
the exact same time as us?

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Billions.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:90%
Billions.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and they made-- made--

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And who do you believe
made us, as far as--

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:38.700 align:middle line:84%
pop culture talks about
all different sorts

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.720 align:middle line:84%
of different deciphering
of Egyptian codes

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and Mayan codes and
things like this.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you know
anything about that?

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: The same guys that
abduct us are the same guys

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:90%
that made us.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
All the stories you hear
about, most of the stories

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:90%
you hear about the bad alien.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Then the dracos and
the reptilians and--

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:90%
It's all confusion.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't want us
to figure it out.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So they throw all this BS in
so we can't figure it out.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And they plan to
screw up your life

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
to see how you
would deal with it,

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:24.150 align:middle line:84%
to see if you can conduct
yourself with integrity,

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.880 align:middle line:84%
without envy, hate, or
greed while you're getting

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:90%
screwed six ways from Sunday.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And all that weight
on your shoulders.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And also utilizing
the people around you

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
as a stress factor to
see how you respond.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Exactly.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So when do you think
disclosure, full disclosure,

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.990 align:middle line:84%
it's happening, trickling
in now and then.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.790 align:middle line:84%
But what's your
take on disclosure?

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: Emery,
listen to me closely.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:57.548 align:middle line:90%
Never ever never.

00:25:57.548 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Because if
they did, it would--

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: It would destroy their
whole story and everything.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Their whole agenda.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: I mean, they've got
a lot of effort based in this

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Bible and Jesus and Moses.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.667 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people believe that.

00:26:11.667 --> 00:26:12.750 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to do?

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Say oh no, by the
way, we made you.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:90%
All that stuff down the drain.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people that
take that stuff seriously.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.220 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a lot
of people out there

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:84%
that are very conscious and
have been through projects

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.076 align:middle line:90%
and have been--

00:26:28.076 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%
are aware they were at the moon
or Mars and all these things.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And I see it eventually,
a long time from now,

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that we might become so
intelligent and so conscious

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that we will be aware
of what has happened.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.117 align:middle line:90%
Could you comment on that or?

00:26:47.117 --> 00:26:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: They don't get to know.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: They don't get to.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.138 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: They might want to
know, what's our purpose?

00:26:51.138 --> 00:26:52.630 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:53.950 align:middle line:90%
Why am I living?

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Do you get to know who made you?

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you get to know why?

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.750 align:middle line:84%
The same reason they
make hundreds of billions

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:90%
of other humans.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:06.690 align:middle line:84%
I noticed also, John, when I
was working my moonlighting

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.800 align:middle line:84%
job with tissue
specimens that mostly all

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.170 align:middle line:84%
the DNA from
extraterrestrials that we

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.960 align:middle line:90%
had had human DNA in it.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.020 align:middle line:90%
So they at some point had to--

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.270 align:middle line:84%
we came from them or
they came from us.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.967 align:middle line:84%
Something happened in the
galaxy is what I'm saying.

00:27:24.967 --> 00:27:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Absolutely.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And so you might
have these beings that are

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.370 align:middle line:84%
interacting that you might
have 10 different looking

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:34.170 align:middle line:90%
reptilians.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:84%
You might have 50 different
looking grays and so forth.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And I try to teach
this, because it's

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.360 align:middle line:84%
silly to say that
one race is just

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.250 align:middle line:84%
all the same when
you're speaking

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.810 align:middle line:90%
about extraterrestrials.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> LEAR: But the one thing
that people have to understand,

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.690 align:middle line:90%
there was no big bang.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
We were always here, and people
have so much trouble with that

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.660 align:middle line:84%
because they say, well,
somebody had to make it.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:90%
You know, we were always here.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.780 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get that,
then there's no help.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It's done
enough for them,

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:84%
because you can't go kick
the tires on the craft.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.000 align:middle line:90%

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.060 align:middle line:84%
It's there, and they're out
there, and we realize this.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just because, I
think, of programming

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.620 align:middle line:84%
how we are brought
up on this planet

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.630 align:middle line:84%
that there's usually an answer
for everything and everyone

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:33.890 align:middle line:90%
has an answer.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And people get really
frustrated when they

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.500 align:middle line:90%
can't figure something out.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: Right.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And you
gotta let that go.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
don't let that go,

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:50.380 align:middle line:84%
you could really hurt yourself
and the people around you.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: I agree with that.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: John,
thanks for joining us.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> LEAR: My pleasure, Emery.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.490 align:middle line:90%
It's great to see you again.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:84%

going to see you soon.
