[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:19.532 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, George Noory.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.970 align:middle line:90%
And I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And what if there was
something like an Area 51

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.800 align:middle line:90%
deep underwater?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.710 align:middle line:10%
We're discussing underwater
bases and technologies

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:10%
with Emery Smith.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.980 align:middle line:90%
This is an amazing topic, Emery.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Yeah, it's
going to be a good one, George.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.043 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, my pleasure.

00:00:39.043 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell me about some of
these ancient underground bases.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.660 align:middle line:90%
What do we know about this?

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
there's ancient bases

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:84%
that have been here
long before we got here.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I tried to explain to
people to grasp this concept

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.400 align:middle line:84%
living in Albuquerque, I did
a lot of mountain climbing.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And I used to collect a lot of
artifacts from the Sandia Peak

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:90%
at 10,800 feet above sea level.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And on these rocks are
basically trilobites

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:90%
and underwater seaweed.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm saying is
that was once underwater,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and now it's 10,800
feet above sea level.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:90%
But let's reverse that.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And let's go to
the deepest place

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
now, the Marianas Trench
there and try to picture this.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe at one
time, that way before--

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking billions
of years ago.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe that was dry.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And there were
civilizations living here

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.840 align:middle line:90%
in these deep places.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.120 align:middle line:10%
And they were living
in these areas

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:10%
with amazing amounts of
energy for some reason,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:10%
like the Bimini Road and right
off the west coast of Cuba.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:10%
There's an
underground Atlantis--

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.129 align:middle line:10%
they're saying with
pyramids larger than Giza.

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:10%
And then you have--
off the coast of Japan,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:10%
they're finding other
artifacts and ruins.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So at one time, obviously,
when the water levels

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:84%
were not so high, there
were civilizations

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:90%
all around the planet.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to
understand that maybe

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.479 align:middle line:90%
that's why all these--

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:84%
they built them on ley
lines and energetic areas,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:90%
too, for some reason.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So there was some
sort of correlation--

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
why these things were happening
and why a lot of the portals

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:84%
they're finding underwater
exist in these areas as well.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So the governments,
and the military,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and science foundations,
and other corporations

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:84%
have clandestinely
got together and are

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
starting to build
these underground water

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:84%
facilities, underground
bases near these zones,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:84%
so they can research them
with proper technology,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:84%
much more advanced technology
than we have right now

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and collect data, collect
artifacts, and reverse engineer

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.145 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:02:56.145 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is that you have

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
underwater bases near
ancient sacred sites all

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.070 align:middle line:90%
over the planet right now.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're building
more, and more, and more.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- couple of
different ways that they built

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.010 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:90%
One of the ways is they have--

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
you know how we built the
space stations all on these--

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Modular.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Modular.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
is going on here.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
They're sending these very
highly pressurized cabins

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're fixing them
together with robots and things

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and creating this
giant facility.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
They're also tunneling
to make a real--

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
one of the real
bases that are not

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:90%
compartmentalized and modular.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
They actually drill
from stateside

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.010 align:middle line:84%
to underneath the ground
into a part of the ocean,

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:90%
and they come up from within.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And they have special
devices that create

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:90%
these electromagnetic fields.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Very, very powerful,
of course, when

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:84%
you're 10,000 feet
below the surface,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that they come up
from the ground.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And it forms this special
bubble, like a sphere.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:90%
And it clears out everything.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:90%
All the water gets pushed back.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And once they
create this bubble,

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:84%
they have some way of putting
up this transparent metal.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.325 align:middle line:84%
It's about 6 feet thick,
and it's transparent.

00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:90%
You see right out of it.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And once that's in place-- that
structure-- then they start

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:90%
just building from within.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:90%
And these things are--

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:84%
could be anywhere from 5
to 20 acres in diameter.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, in the ancient
times, what came first?

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.354 align:middle line:90%
The base or the water?

00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The base
was there first.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And then it got--

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.353 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then it
got covered with water.

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the Marianas Trench,
there's a large portal there

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:84%
that they've been following for
quite some time in evaluating

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:90%
and taking--

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.947 align:middle line:84%
test on this, where
these craft are coming

00:04:56.947 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:90%
in and out of this portal.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.864 align:middle line:90%
They're not engaging them.

00:04:59.864 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:84%
They're not trying
to do anything.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.530 align:middle line:90%
They're just kind of watching.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's near this other ancient
structure that's down there.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So they put a base there
that's very close by

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:84%
to monitor this portal
and also build out

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:84%
a base down there, where they
can spend a lot more time

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:84%
analyzing the portal, analyzing
this archaeological find.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are these
bases there primarily,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Emery, to monitor ET
movement or something else?

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
the primary reason

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
was to monitor the portals
where the extraterrestrials were

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.030 align:middle line:90%
coming in and out of.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Then they found artifacts
near these areas of the planet

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:90%
where the portals are.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're knowing this
is like the chain of what's

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.670 align:middle line:90%
been going on.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Find a portal?

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.664 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's near another
new archaeological site.

00:05:46.664 --> 00:05:48.455 align:middle line:84%
Let's build a base
nearby and monitor this.

00:05:48.455 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Aha.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Why underwater?

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
number one, they have

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:84%
to have 24-hour
surveillance on this area.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.090 align:middle line:84%
They're taking
readings constantly,

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
fluctuations in the
electromagnetic fields.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
replicate this.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:90%
They want to learn.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Where are these things going?

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And why is it-- here
it is in the water.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Does it also come
out in the water

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:84%
somewhere else if
you go back in?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I think they're probably getting
teams together to try this out.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
They have already sent
drones in and other things,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't work.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It just-- these things
only open up now and then.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Timing has to be right.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's the last
I've heard recently

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
of some of the things
going on down in that area.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How many bases
are there on this planet?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, there's dozens.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
they're all at.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:90%
And they're very common.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.337 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Modern?

00:06:46.337 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The new
ones are very modern.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.774 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:06:48.774 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:84%
They're no different than the
underground facilities where

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
people might stay
for up to a year.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So they are making this a very
highly clandestine research

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.610 align:middle line:84%
facility to gather information
to videotape and log,

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.890 align:middle line:84%
to also have an area where
they can remotely control--

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:84%
these underwater video
surveillance things

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:90%
are constantly--

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.850 align:middle line:84%
like our F-16s are
flying around the coast

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:90%
of America every minute.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Every second there's a couple
of them up there protecting us.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:84%
They're doing the same thing
down there monitoring this.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's an ongoing,
very expensive project.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So with these transparent metal
domes that are on the sea beds

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.350 align:middle line:84%
the only way to get to
them is to start stateside,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.630 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a maglev that
takes you near the base

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and drops you off, and then
you come up from below,

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:90%
from stateside.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're under the
rock under the ocean.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Geez.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah,
you're deep under--

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Miles down.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, absolutely.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you come back
up still in the tube.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.014 align:middle line:84%
All the supplies
come from there.

00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How many people
are staffing these things?

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I wouldn't know.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.256 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, have
you been assigned to any

00:07:57.256 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:90%
of these underwater bases?

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I have been to
some of these facilities,

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:90%
but not assigned there.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So when you say you've
been there, in what capacity?

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was only
there to examine

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:90%
some extraterrestrial bodies.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.230 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Medically?

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Medically.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And how did
they get you down there?

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Through the tube system?

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, through
the tube system.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I've already been
on the tube system,

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:84%
working in New Mexico for short
distances for different areas

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:90%
underground.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.205 align:middle line:84%
And remember, it's
not under the water.

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
It's under the water,
under the ground.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't take
too much longer for me

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:84%
to go from New Mexico
to the Gulf of Mexico.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't take much longer
for me to go from New Mexico

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:84%
to the Atlantic
Ocean, let's say.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:90%
It was not much more time.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:90%
And I don't--

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell you exactly
how fast these things travel,

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:84%
but they do travel
very, very, very fast.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was many people that
were going to these facilities

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:90%
in and out.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed like
a very busy place.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What would
happen if there

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:84%
was an underwater earthquake,
and they do occur,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:90%
where these structures are?

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: First of all, the
ones that they drop down

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
into the ocean and build on a
cliffside or on a sea floor--

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:90%
they're all modular.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.720 align:middle line:84%
They're not really
connected to the floor,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:90%
so they handle it pretty well.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're connected,
but they have things in place.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:84%
They can move around like when
you put your boat on the dock

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and you leave a loose rope,
so when the tides come in.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:90%
So very similar.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.620 align:middle line:84%
As far as the transparent,
metal, bubble ones,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:90%
these are also very flexible.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:90%
So it has a lot of give to it.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And this was brought up
at one of the meetings.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I knew more
about this material.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is definitely a
reverse engineered material

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:84%
that they have
developed and designed

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.095 align:middle line:84%
through extraterrestrial
devices.

00:09:45.095 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So what are
they doing down there

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.530 align:middle line:90%
that you can't do above ground?

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it's easier
for them to remote control

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:84%
their underwater drones
to survey and surveillance

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.322 align:middle line:84%
this area's hot spot
down there of all

00:09:59.322 --> 00:10:00.780 align:middle line:84%
these extraterrestrial
craft coming

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:90%
in and out of this portal.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So it's
all ET related?

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.373 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Definitely.

00:10:04.373 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Primarily the reason they
built this was to monitor that.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do the ETs
know we're there?

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:90%
And do they work with us?

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
extraterrestrials

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.770 align:middle line:84%
in those facilities
that I'm aware of.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.211 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
any communication

00:10:19.211 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
with the extraterrestrials
that are coming in and out.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.417 align:middle line:84%
They're just kind of like
a photographer in Africa--

00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Just monitoring.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --just kind of hiding
out and watching the lions eat.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So the ETs don't
show any hostilities?

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, not
to my knowledge.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.215 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Who
concocted this plan?

00:10:36.215 --> 00:10:37.680 align:middle line:90%
How did this thing start?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It all started because
the energy signature down

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
they spotted somehow using their
technologies with satellites.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And they sent a couple
drones down there.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And they captured
on film these craft

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:84%
coming in and out of this
area in the Marianas Trench.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
where it's at.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So they decided
this is something

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:84%
very important that we
need to study, of course.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So they spent billions
and trillions of dollars

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to get these
facilities down there,

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.450 align:middle line:84%
so they can monitor what the
extraterrestrials are doing.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:90%
And where are they going?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And tracking of the craft
through the oceans as well.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same thing.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:84%
These craft are no
different than the craft

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
that they're using to
travel intergalactically.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So that being said,
they're creating

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.500 align:middle line:84%
their own gravitational
field even in the water.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:84%
They can go very, very fast
and do these right-hand turns.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And you hear a lot
of these stories

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.395 align:middle line:90%
of the subs and other military.

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Coming and going?

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, coming and
going out of the water.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
visualized and videotaped

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:90%
by the military for many years.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They said Nazi Germany
had underwater bases as well.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.887 align:middle line:90%
Any proof to that?

00:11:49.887 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I think they did.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know too much
about the history of that.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.170 align:middle line:84%
But I know they were very adept
at learning new technologies.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe they were
some of the first people

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:84%
to meet with extraterrestrials
and make exchanges

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:84%
with technology or
have shot down craft

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:90%
and reverse engineered it.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So they had a good
stronghold of technology.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.110 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And they were capable of doing
some amazing things with it.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.816 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't have
a doubt in my mind

00:12:21.816 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't have
something like this all over.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: At any
given time, how long

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.022 align:middle line:84%
are the people who are working
down there staying down there?

00:12:30.022 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I really don't know.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.090 align:middle line:90%
I was only there for a day.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's
long enough, right?

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It wasn't--

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.712 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't assigned
there, I'll say.

00:12:37.712 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But I mean,
could they be there

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:90%
for years or just a short time?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's set up that someone
could live there indefinitely.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have
their own water system.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are there
families down there?

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, there's no family.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No kids?

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.540 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like everyone
is addressed a certain way.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:90%
And everyone has a duty there.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very mission,
work-oriented environment.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.602 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Could these be
used for military purposes?

00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They could be.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know what
they would use it for.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have a
research facility

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of the ocean.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:84%
They're utilizing it to gather
intelligence and information

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.035 align:middle line:84%
from the energy
signatures of the area.

00:13:18.035 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
military would do with that.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.982 align:middle line:84%
It's not like an undersea
docking base for submarines.

00:13:24.982 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they already have
enough of that stuff.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's a good point.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They've got
that cave system off

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:90%
the coast there in San Diego.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
It goes all the
way through the--

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:90%
all the way to Nevada.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, that these giant
subs can pass through.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And they have underground
facilities for them.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:40.770 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What was your mission?

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Why were you down there?

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Someone called in sick.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do you mean--
somebody called in sick?

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Someone called in sick,
couldn't make it that day that

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to do this.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And so you--

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.186 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: For some
reason, they could not

00:13:52.186 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:90%
transport the being to us.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.777 align:middle line:84%
So they sent me out there to
bring the samples back with me.

00:13:56.777 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That was your mission?

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That was it.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And what kind
of samples were they?

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They were muscle
and tissue samples.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Of?

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Of a type
of Aquafarian being.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And what did
these tissues show you?

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I wasn't part of the
genetics for that program.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You just
got the samples?

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was only
there to take it.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I was just a tech.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: When you
say an aqua being,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.218 align:middle line:84%
are you talking about
something like a mermaid?

00:14:16.218 --> 00:14:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: He's like a mermaid.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.146 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They found
a civilization

00:14:19.146 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
that lives down there that
very rarely comes out.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: ET?

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Or were they Earth-like?

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.785 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're human
looking, but with fins.

00:14:25.785 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I spoke about this
in other episodes.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:90%
They have webbed hands.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:84%
They have fins that go down
the outside of their arms,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and legs, and their body,
kind of like a cuttlefish.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:84%
They're like a bluish-white
color, I would say.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:90%
They have more rounder heads.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.770 align:middle line:90%
And they do have gills.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:90%
They breathe only underwater.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:90%
They do not like light at all.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.560 align:middle line:90%
They have very large eyes.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:84%
They can see
definitely underwater.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: A species that we
probably don't know about.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's a species--

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.753 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Up on top.

00:15:02.753 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --they're trying
to learn about now.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these species, I
think, are being discovered.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure more and
more will come out

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.980 align:middle line:84%
in the future of these
species that are living down

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:84%
there, living in the inner Earth
caverns of the Marianas Trench

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
withstand these pressures--

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:90%
these beings.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Even though they kind
of look very human

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and they look delicate, they
somehow have kind of like a--

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.160 align:middle line:90%
bird bones are kind of hollow.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I noticed
about these species was they

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:90%
have a spongy bone.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like very--

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:90%
like cartilage.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:54.229 align:middle line:84%
It has an ability, I think,
to expand and to shrink.

00:15:54.229 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It sounds
like they're more

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:84%
earthbound than
extraterrestrial.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Is that a pretty
good assumption?

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think they were
seeded here like we were.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe
that they've been here

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.460 align:middle line:90%
a lot longer than we have.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Do they seem friendly?

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:08.775 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I don't have any--

00:16:08.775 --> 00:16:10.399 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Firsthand
experience on this.

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --live experience
with them or live video.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I hear a lot of
stories in the projects

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
that they have made themselves
noticed to these facilities,

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
but have not done anything
to hurt them or threaten.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe the
facilities have a lot of videos

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and pictures of these beings.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I've seen a lot of
this taken by underwater drone

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.662 align:middle line:90%
footage of these beings.

00:16:38.662 --> 00:16:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How would these
underwater facilities

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.147 align:middle line:90%
compare to laboratories up top?

00:16:43.147 --> 00:16:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, very similar.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.605 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
different is a lot

00:16:45.605 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:84%
of the underground facilities
here are kind of archaic,

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.280 align:middle line:84%
because they started
with a small base.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the deeper
you go, the more modern

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.920 align:middle line:84%
it gets, because
they keep expanding.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of the opposite
with these new bases

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
that they're developing
quickly around the oceans.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:90%
It's like you said.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot more
ultra-modern technology,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.669 align:middle line:84%
and it's just a
very different look.

00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What other
technologies did you witness

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:11.609 align:middle line:90%
down there?

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, one
of the neat things

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.355 align:middle line:84%
I realized is they had something
that we had on topside,

00:17:16.355 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:84%
which was underground
by the way.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Our underground facilities
had these giant aquarium

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.380 align:middle line:90%
operating rooms.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the
extraterrestrials we work on--

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.079 align:middle line:84%
we have to keep them
in a special salt water

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:84%
while you take
samples from them,

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:84%
or the tissue will,
for some reason,

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
just degrade and dissolve
if you bring it up

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:90%
to the oxygen-enriched air.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:84%
They had-- couple
of these operating

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.810 align:middle line:84%
rooms that were, of
course, aquariums,

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.264 align:middle line:90%
which was amazing to me.

00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I was thinking,
oh, maybe that's

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:90%
where they got the idea from.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we have--

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --the same
one in the facilities.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did you have
to work underwater

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.290 align:middle line:84%
with breathing apparatus
and things like that?

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, some of the
species I had to work on--

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I had to be in these operating
room aquariums, environments,

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.800 align:middle line:90%
because of the bodies--

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.150 align:middle line:84%
had to be in a certain salinity
and pH, or they would dissolve.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.490 align:middle line:90%
So we had our own suits.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Not like a scuba
diver, because I

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:84%
had to have my own atmosphere
and my own completely contained

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.767 align:middle line:90%
suit with magnets on your shoes.

00:18:22.767 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And you walk up to-- it
still has the same things.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:90%
You still have a table.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.275 align:middle line:84%
You still have
all the computers.

00:18:27.275 --> 00:18:28.774 align:middle line:84%
You still have all
your instruments.

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:84%
You still have everything,
but you're underwater.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.925 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But you had to
work on them underwater?

00:18:32.925 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You had
to work on them.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.341 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Had to do that?

00:18:35.341 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You had to work on them
underwater, take the samples,

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and collect them the
same way you would.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.739 align:middle line:84%
You just did
everything underwater.

00:18:42.739 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's amazing what's
going on, on this planet.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And not a lot of
people know about it.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's unreal.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How
expensive is all this?

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.078 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They couldn't
even put a number on it.

00:18:51.078 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're creating
new civilizations

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
on parts of the planet
where we thought it

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:90%
was inhospitable to even live.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're making
major breakthroughs

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.930 align:middle line:84%
that I hope comes forward
soon to divulge this.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't always have
to be living on the surface.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:14.050 align:middle line:84%
There's other places in
the Earth and in the oceans

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:84%
that we can show
self-sustainability.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Without the
ET presence, Emery,

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.800 align:middle line:84%
would we be in these
underwater bases?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I don't believe so.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
They always have to have
a reason why they're

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
going to dump trillions
of dollars into something

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.759 align:middle line:90%
to find out something.

00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There is a
submarine base in the middle

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:90%
of the Nevada desert.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:90%
It's called Hawthorne, Nevada.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is it doing there?

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.047 align:middle line:90%
There's no water there.

00:19:36.047 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I always
laugh when I see it,

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
lakes, really, in Nevada.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What's going on there?

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
there is a facility.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.270 align:middle line:84%
That system underground
does go right through there.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I saw the underground
maps for this.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And they can move subs from
one coast to the other coast

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.830 align:middle line:90%
very easily.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:84%
These are huge
cavernous systems.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it's a tight
fit in some places, so--

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How would you
rate these underground and

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
underwater bases in
terms of complexity?

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's a great
undertaking by--

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:90%
surely.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:90%
But you have to understand.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.110 align:middle line:84%
They're not using a
backhoe to do this.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:15.190 align:middle line:84%
They are using technologies
that the people are not

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.340 align:middle line:90%
aware of to create the system--

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:25.150 align:middle line:84%
to create these self-sustainable
cities and modular laboratories

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:26.860 align:middle line:84%
that makes it a
little bit easier.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you
put in perspective

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
all the technologies
that are used

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
to make these things that
people are unaware of,

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:84%
then it would make
it seem more--

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:84%
it would be easier for you to
understand how they actually

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:90%
did it.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: These unidentified
submerged objects--

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:84%
what are they doing down
there in the first place?

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They are utilizing
the Earth to get from point A

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.470 align:middle line:84%
to point B. So I think it's
just a transition area, to be

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:84%
honest, is what I believe, that
they're going from this portal

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:90%
maybe to another portal.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I just think
they're just down there.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is an area that's
a very big hot spot.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think there's
any other intention

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.550 align:middle line:84%
other than that they're
utilizing it for.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be something
embedded into the rock

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:84%
there that might be a base that
they're trying to figure out.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.120 align:middle line:90%
That's extraterrestrial.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.850 align:middle line:90%
So I think this is just a hub.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just a
hub like we have hubs

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.485 align:middle line:84%
with our airports
and things like that,

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:28.197 align:middle line:90%
that this is such a hot zone.

00:21:28.197 --> 00:21:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where are these
underwater bases, Emery?

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Are they everywhere
on the planet or just

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:90%
with the United States?

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I don't
know the exact location

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:90%
of all the bases.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I just know there's
underground facilities

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.910 align:middle line:84%
in all the oceans of the planet
that we as man has put there.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a question about
the underground traveling

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:90%
system for this.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And there are-- under
the United States,

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
there's huge caverns that these
submarines can travel through

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.749 align:middle line:90%
and it's all full of water.

00:22:02.749 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But you think
they're everywhere?

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I believe
the whole Earth--

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.410 align:middle line:84%
you can get all over,
through these caverns.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.506 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:09.506 --> 00:22:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Who are these
underwater bases for?

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:90%
To monitor ET activity?

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:90%
For humankind?

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:90%
For these aqua beings?

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.447 align:middle line:90%
What are they for?

00:22:17.447 --> 00:22:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think they're
there to monitor all the above.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anytime they
find something new,

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:84%
they want to infiltrate it,
study it, learn what it knows,

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
learn why these energy
systems are here

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:90%
or these portals are here.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's all the above.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.740 align:middle line:84%
But they're
watching, monitoring,

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:90%
surveilling this hot spot.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.936 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: These
submerged vehicles--

00:22:42.936 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:90%
where are they coming from?

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:44.861 align:middle line:90%
Are they ours?

00:22:44.861 --> 00:22:47.193 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the ones that
are coming into the portals

00:22:47.193 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:90%
are extraterrestrials.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:84%
We do have our own submersible,
anti-gravitic craft,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.850 align:middle line:84%
just like we have
reverse engineered

00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these things for
flying around the atmosphere.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.530 align:middle line:90%
So we have the same thing.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.090 align:middle line:90%
These craft can go atmospheric.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.080 align:middle line:90%
They can go underwater.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:90%
They could do anything.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:90%
So we have our own as well.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You've seen
some of these tanks

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:84%
where medical practitioners
put their hand in gloves,

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and then they operate
inside the tank.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But they're physically
on the outside.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:90%
You're inside.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.580 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The being cannot
really leave that area.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And that one operating
room aquarium

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:32.597 align:middle line:84%
is made up of many other rooms
for the testing of the tissues.

00:23:32.597 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:90%
So they have a whole laboratory.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:90%
It's all underwater.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So everything stays with
the being underwater.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's just kept side by
side, including yourself.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.360 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: These
underwater bases--

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.809 align:middle line:90%
are they extraterrestrial made?

00:23:46.809 --> 00:23:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we
made our own bases,

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:84%
as I discussed in
the past, that we

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:90%
have in these hot spot areas.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And there are
extraterrestrial bases nearby

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
that are built into the
rock there that they're

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.719 align:middle line:90%
investigating right now.

00:24:01.719 --> 00:24:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Who built them?

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.218 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The
extraterrestrials did.

00:24:04.218 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, thanks for
being on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.875 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Thank you, George.

00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And thank you for
watching "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.540 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.380 align:middle line:10%
and secret space programs.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we've been spliced
over millennia with many,

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:84%
many different genomes
from other races.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%

and out of him came four drones.

>> These ETs are
very compassionate.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Some have volunteered
to be here.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Some have crashed here.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Some have been shot down here.
