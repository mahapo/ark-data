00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:19.322 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.190 align:middle line:10%
I'm Jay Weidner, and today we're
continuing our conversation

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.000 align:middle line:10%
with Jason Rice.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:10%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON RICE: Hello, Jay.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for having me again.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So let's just
recap a little bit here.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:84%
You were wounded
gravely on Planet Three.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And you went to Mars,
where you rehabbed,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and then you went
back to Planet Two

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.075 align:middle line:84%
to work in kind of
the recovery program.

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You got to actually
see the results of,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.625 align:middle line:84%
I guess we could say the
Cabal's plan, for this planet.

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And it was
basically to move them

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:84%
from a rural agrarian kind of
society to a more high tech.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And to do it quickly, they
had to basically manipulate

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.532 align:middle line:84%
the situation
through false flags.

00:00:58.532 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So here we are.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:90%
You're on this planet.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:90%
What happens now?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, we're there
to help them rebuild

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:90%
and to help keep the peace.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our mission posture
was related to policing actions,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
because the scope
and the breadth

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
of the war pretty much affected
every corner of the planet.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the social services
or the governmental services

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:84%
where they were,
were broken down.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And the entire population
that was left--

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:84%
again, about a third of the
4 billion that started out--

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
where what were remaining,
they were reliant entirely

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:84%
on the government structure
for their well-being,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
for their supplies, for their
food, for their housing,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:90%
taking care of their families.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So part of our mission
structure required

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
us to take on policing
actions, or civil service.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So we had to finish out and
help them get that established.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And part of the plan
was by the Cabal

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
to get them to a technology
based civilization

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:84%
as quickly as possible,
because part of the AI plan

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
was to speed up the
technology progression.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And this was
the MO pretty much,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I would say that this group
that you were operating with,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.250 align:middle line:90%
were doing everywhere.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And even beyond what
you experienced.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Even beyond
what I experienced.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How long did
you serve in this duty?

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.875 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was on the rebuilding
efforts for Callidus 3

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:39.750 align:middle line:90%
for another couple of years.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And then you finally--

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.355 align:middle line:84%
that was the end
of your service?

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And that was the
end of my deployment.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.898 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What do they do, come
up to you and say, hey thanks.

00:02:46.898 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
You've been helpful, but
we're sending you back?

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, they weren't
finished with me yet.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.320 align:middle line:84%
They decided that the experience
and knowledge that I had gained

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.920 align:middle line:84%
through my deployments
on a number of planets

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.400 align:middle line:84%
was invaluable to the
continued efforts,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and they needed me in
the training regiments.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that was where I
spent my next appointment.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I was returned back
to the Sol System,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and spent the remaining years
of my service in the SSP

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:90%
working as a trainer.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: For tactics and weapons?

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Tactics, weapons.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
New people coming
in, they're going

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.997 align:middle line:84%
through the exact same thing
that I had gone through.

00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: A lot of people
going through these things?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.868 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were
about 5,000 a year.

00:03:32.868 --> 00:03:34.243 align:middle line:84%
Just about any
and every country.

00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:35.951 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Are they
volunteers, these people,

00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:38.280 align:middle line:84%
or were they taken against
their will, or what?

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were
all volunteers.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:84%
All of the ones that I
helped in the training

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:90%
were all volunteers.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:84%
They were all service or
military related in some way,

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:84%
be it the Navy or the Marines
or the Air Force or the Army,

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:90%
from a wide range of countries.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And how long
did you do this?

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I did this
for almost five years.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.705 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That's
quite an adventure.

00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It probably
was a relief to be

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.250 align:middle line:84%
doing that work after being
in the battles and wars.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was a
double edged sword.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
It was rewarding, as well
as incredibly concerning.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Because that was around the time
that I started piecing together

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the puzzle pieces
and getting a full picture,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:84%
a better picture, of
what was really going on.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: One of the things that we
didn't cover in your narrative

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:84%
was the time that you spent
in the South Pacific, right?

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to at least
touch on this, so let's do.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:84%
How did you get to the South
Pacific early on in your career

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.910 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
The training that we
went through in the FIG--

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
the Fort Indiantown
Gap-- underground base

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:90%
wrapped up with two missions.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.090 align:middle line:90%
The first was to Antarctica.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
In which we had to individually
use our intuitive empath

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
abilities to navigate
back to base.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And then the second was
similar, except that it

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:90%
wasn't in Antarctica.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:90%
It was in the South Pacific.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Arne and Nicobar
islands off the coast of India

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:10%
have these large
rock structures there

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:10%
off the coast in which you have
these essentially cylinders

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:10%
of islands that are topped
with grass and green

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.990 align:middle line:10%
and have some foliage.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But they're amazingly
beautiful structures.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.150 align:middle line:10%
And there's an area--

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:10%
I still have not
located it, but there's

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:10%
an area in the South Pacific
where we were dropped off

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.150 align:middle line:10%
on the top of one of these.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, this was an
individual exercise

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
in which we were reliant upon
our intuitive empath abilities

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:84%
to navigate our way
back to our base.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle line:84%
The purpose being is that
they wanted us, number one,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
to have full confidence
in those abilities.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they build
us up to a point where

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:90%
they have to test it.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one
of the ways they've

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:84%
found to be the best way to do
it is to set a person loose.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And so
again, was it trying

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:84%
to find your way back navigating
through, what the jungle,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.910 align:middle line:90%
or what?

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: This was a
little different.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Part of the anti-gravity
tactics that they taught us

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and that we trained
on involved the use

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.300 align:middle line:84%
of what, for the lack of a
better way of putting it,

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:84%
were these
transformable gliders.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
individual gliders.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.250 align:middle line:84%
We had individual
anti-gravity packs.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:84%
They were limited
by their batteries,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:84%
so you didn't have to
use a full pulse drive.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
You could use it as
intermittent to get you

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:90%
where you needed to go.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And then using the natural
aerodynamics of a glider--

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Hang glider?

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.873 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Hang glider, yeah.

00:06:59.873 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you use
g-forces to lift,

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.005 align:middle line:84%
and then you use the
aerodynamics to fly around.

00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, they
dropped us off

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:90%
on the top of these pillars.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And some of them were hundreds
of feet up above the water.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a natural jump
off point to get airborne,

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and so we didn't have to
use the anti-gravity pulse

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.070 align:middle line:84%
of our backpacks
to get us airborne.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And so once you got
airborne, then you

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:84%
would try and find neo-thermals
to keep and stay aloft

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
so that you could preserve the
backpack as long as possible.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And that
was the training,

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:90%
was to try to stay aloft?

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Stay aloft
and to direct and find

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:90%
that we're about 500 miles away.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.320 align:middle line:84%
The base-- is it this
direction or that direction?

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:90%
You have no idea, no clue.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So you have to use your
intuitive empathic abilities

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:84%
to say, OK, I think
it's this direction.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.170 align:middle line:84%
That feels right, and that's
the way that I'm going.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you had to
navigate your way

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
there using the tools that they
gave you, the limited ones.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:84%
The gliders transformed,
had floats on them,

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.990 align:middle line:84%
so that if you did
go down in the water,

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:84%
mechanically you could
reconfigure it into what

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.780 align:middle line:90%
became a small sail craft.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Because you know,
the wings were fabric

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and so they're easily
converted into a sailing craft.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Did you get back?

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Apparently, you did.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I made it back.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:84%
It took me about
12 days to do it.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And the nanite
enhancements allowed you

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.039 align:middle line:84%
to preserve and
conserve your energy,

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
as well as requiring that you
didn't have to eat as often.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:84%
We carried water with us, and
so we weren't devoid of water.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was rationed
out individually so

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.640 align:middle line:90%
that you survived the trip.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Part of what I
had also provided,

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
because I'm an engineer with
the conventional training

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
as an engineer, is that
at one point in time,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
I was called to a
Russian base to help them

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:84%
with what was an advanced
propulsion system on a ground

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
vehicle that they had
captured from somewhere.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.650 align:middle line:90%
I had never seen it before.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh, really?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And this was a Russian base
in space or here on Earth?

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: This was a Russian
base here on Earth.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Tell me about the base
in Russia that you went to.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The Russian
base that I went

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:84%
to was in the tropical area
on the planet somewhere.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that it was in
Russia, the mainland of Russia

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.680 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.240 align:middle line:84%
But it was somewhere
within the tropical areas,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
based on the weather and the
temperature and humidity.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.192 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: This was during your time
that you were training people?

00:09:47.192 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: This was the time
that I was training people.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.459 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Engineering skills?

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I used my
engineering skills.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.125 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And what was this
thing you were looking at?

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was a ground vehicle.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:84%
It had wheels, except the power
plant was something I'd never

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:90%
seen before or experienced.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted my
help and assistance

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:84%
in evaluating what it
was and how it operated.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Part, I'd say about a
third of the vehicle,

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.884 align:middle line:90%
had been destroyed through--

00:10:15.884 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't tell
me what it was.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:90%
I didn't ask.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:90%
But part of it was missing.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
The parts that we did
have were enough to do

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.575 align:middle line:84%
some reverse engineering
and some work on.

00:10:26.575 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And why
did they think you

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:90%
were going to be able to help?

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Because of my
engineering background,

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and the experience that I'd
had on multiple planets.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And like me, you may have seen
one of these vehicles in--

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Correct.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they ever discern
what this vehicle was

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:90%
or where it came from?

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I suspect
that it was probably

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
from one of the other
division's exploits

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:84%
from a different planet
that I had not been to.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is the Russian SSP
associated with the Cabal SSP,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:90%
or are they all the same?

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: All of the
countries on the planet

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:16.690 align:middle line:84%
contribute soldiers to
this Mars German program.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Because any country that
wants to participate

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
or be able to use the LOC
has to contribute soldiers

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:90%
to the effort.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the price.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So then any
other adventures

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.687 align:middle line:84%
between that and the time
that you had to go back?

00:11:32.687 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There was
another time where I

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:90%
was off planet at a conference.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.954 align:middle line:84%
I was traveling there on an Air
Force SSP interstellar craft.

00:11:43.954 --> 00:11:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people
that I was with

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:90%
were Air Force personnel, SSP.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was there for
advanced physics,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
as well as learning some of
the new latest and greatest

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.119 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What was it like
to be on this ship?

00:11:58.119 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was an amazing ship.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.470 align:middle line:84%
It was a cross
between the shuttle

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.757 align:middle line:84%
and B-2 Stealth is
about the closest analog

00:12:06.757 --> 00:12:07.840 align:middle line:90%
that I could come up with.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So it had wings?

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was used
inside an atmosphere,

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and it was using the
anti-gravity propulsion

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
However, the
aerodynamics of it, it

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
didn't rely on wings
for lift, per se.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that the shape that
they used for those wings

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:34.660 align:middle line:84%
was more for disinformation,
as well as space.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Keeping a large open
space inside it,

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
so that the entire craft being
a large wing more or less,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.870 align:middle line:90%
they had a lot of room inside.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So that was a combination
between the two.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So it was
like anti-gravity,

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.984 align:middle line:84%
but they put wings on it to make
everyone think it was flying

00:12:53.984 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:90%
in the air like an airplane?

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.809 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:90%
I bet they do that a lot.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They do
that quite a bit,

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:84%
to keep the
disinformation going.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That's very interesting.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.110 align:middle line:84%
You could even do that with
like rockets and missiles.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Absolutely.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Wings on them
and go over your head

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:84%
and you just think it
was a plane going by.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.366 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Just think it
was a plane or a drone.

00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:12.573 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: How did you close out?

00:13:12.573 --> 00:13:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's just go to that.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the last things that
I did for the SSP was I

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
out-processed through
a facility at Area 51.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:84%
That was my first back
to Earth drop off.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I spent a few days
there re-acclimating.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And then before getting
transferred to a Naval base

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:84%
in the Northeastern
US, where they

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.620 align:middle line:84%
had all of the
medical procedures.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
retirement ceremony.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:90%
I got a provisional promotion--

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:84%
because again, in the SSP
program that I was in,

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.660 align:middle line:84%
none of the Earth
soldiers were allowed

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:90%
above the rank of Major.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Because that wouldn't--
except for the medical.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Medical is always--

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They need doctors.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They need doctors.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:84%
But for everybody
else, you never

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:84%
made it above Major, no matter
how many accolades you had

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.560 align:middle line:90%
or how well you did.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So where did you end up?

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, after
I out-processed

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
from the German
SSP, back on Earth

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:84%
the retirement ceremony gave
me a provisional Lieutenant

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Colonel.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Which again, was another lie.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll get
into more of those.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Keep dangling the lies in
front and keep them distracted.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They must have been kind
of laughing at you in a way.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Of course.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Kind of humiliating
when you think about it.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.945 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you were given
like a little ceremony,

00:14:43.945 --> 00:14:46.114 align:middle line:84%
and you probably had
to sign paperwork.

00:14:46.114 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Oh, of course.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:84%
They did not sparing any
part of the disinformation.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Here's your promotion papers,
and your promotion documents.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And of course, none
of it ever made it

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:90%
through the transition process.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Just theater.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.605 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Just theater.

00:15:01.605 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And then what?

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.330 align:middle line:84%
You went into the
place where they

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:08.540 align:middle line:84%
do the nefarious act of setting
you back to your previous 20

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:90%
year period?

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.297 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:15:10.297 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What was that like?

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: What they
go through first

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:16.630 align:middle line:84%
is they put us through an
intense medical procedure that

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:90%
lasts about 14 days.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:84%
The medical procedures
are so invasive that they

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
have on premises
quarters where you stay.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And immediately outside the
door of your shared apartment--

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.830 align:middle line:84%
because there were other people
there going through the same

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:90%
procedure that I was--

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
immediately outside the
door is the entrance

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.150 align:middle line:90%
to the medical labs.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the process
is akin to going

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.360 align:middle line:90%
through intense chemotherapy.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.370 align:middle line:90%
It leaves you drained, sick.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember a lot
from that time period

00:15:55.190 --> 00:16:00.200 align:middle line:84%
because I was so doped up during
the process, as well as so sick

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle line:90%
during the process.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.650 align:middle line:84%
They keep you half
awake, as well,

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:84%
for the purposes of trying to
keep you from screaming in pain

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:84%
or from resisting the
procedures because of all

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.549 align:middle line:84%
the intense physical discomfort
that you have to go through.

00:16:19.549 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What, they put you
on like liquid morphine

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:90%
or something the whole time?

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I imagine it was
something akin to that.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:26.670 align:middle line:90%
That's horrifying.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They keep you
doped up, drugged up.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're also coming
away with a possible addiction

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:84%
to morphine and all
sorts of terrible things.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There's no
telling what else.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.080 align:middle line:84%
The mental,
psychological process

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
that's combined with
removing all the nanites,

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:84%
cleaning out the entire system,
re-setting the physical body

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
to the point where they took
you from the initial timeline

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and put you into the SSP.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the goal is
to reset everything,

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to erase anything they can that
would show proof or evidence

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.272 align:middle line:90%
of your time in the SSP.

00:17:05.272 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Then after this
horrifying period,

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:84%
you like woke up back
20 years earlier?

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.364 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: 20 years earlier with
what appeared to be a cold.

00:17:13.364 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You thought
you had a cold?

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.071 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Thought you had a cold.

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I got it.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.830 align:middle line:90%
The stress.

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And nobody else
in the unit had a cold.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:90%
I didn't suffer from colds.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you never got
sick the whole time?

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Never gotten sick the
whole time, except for that

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:29.530 align:middle line:90%
once.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And then you woke up
back here on Earth with a cold.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you were
what, 24 years old?

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.060 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I didn't remember any
of it until 20 years later.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What was life
like after that for you?

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Were you visibly
shook up, or did you

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:90%
just kind of go through life?

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was incredibly
emotionally affected

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:90%
after my return.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I was suffering from
PTSD, depression.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.024 align:middle line:84%
I mean, any number of
things I was going through.

00:18:00.024 --> 00:18:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Was it all a mystery?

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was all an
incredibly big mystery.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I went through and tried
to find a conventional

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.620 align:middle line:84%
or the obvious
answers for what, why?

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And you go through and
you talk to doctors

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and you work
through the process.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And eventually put
that period behind me,

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and just went about
trying to get on

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of my life.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And then eventually did
memories start coming back?

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Memories
started coming back,

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and I started having
recollections.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And at first they
were just, wow,

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:90%
that was a really vivid dream.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Or why do I feel
this tendency to want

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.550 align:middle line:90%
to understand this more?

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Or why is it that I want
to have that answer?

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And why do I feel
like that that's

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:84%
not the right answer
for this question?

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.890 align:middle line:90%
So it was a 20 year process.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you ever have any
weird encounters with anyone

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:84%
that you thought might
have been watching you?

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I sure did.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh, really?

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I sure did.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Once the memories started
coming back a lot better,

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:84%
it shed a whole new light on why
there were people watching me

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:90%
while I was at Fort Wood.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Or why I remembered
people coming

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.760 align:middle line:84%
to see me in my quarters,
which I couldn't

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.920 align:middle line:90%
put any explanation to.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So during your
service in the military,

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.902 align:middle line:84%
which occurred after
this 20 and Back--

00:19:26.902 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You were having
strange encounters

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.760 align:middle line:90%
during this time period.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Being followed,
being watched, people coming

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:90%
and visiting me.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Under different
disguises and things,

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.160 align:middle line:84%
saying that they were
somebody that they weren't?

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, they would come
and visit me in my quarters,

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:90%
so they were on base.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So they must have
had access, they

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:84%
must have had
clearance to be there.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:84%
But you know, these men in black
suits show up at your door.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.640 align:middle line:84%
The only memories
I had at that time

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:84%
were, OK, I'm here for
officers basic training.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And so you know,
anybody shows up

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:84%
at your door
flashing a badge, you

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:90%
do what they need you to do.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Although the mind wipes they
used after they visited,

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to recall
what they were there for.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.695 align:middle line:84%
Just flashes and images of them
being there and showing up.

00:20:18.695 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is there any chance that
these guys, these men in black,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:90%
were from the AFOSI--

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.620 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force Office of
Special Investigation?

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There's no telling
where they were from.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.640 align:middle line:90%
They could have--

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sure?

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.739 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, Not that
I've remembered.

00:20:32.739 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Not that I've remembered.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I hear from
the rumor mill

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:84%
that it's the AFOSI that's
doing the men in black.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I wouldn't doubt it.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I imagine that
there probably are

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
a lot of covers that they use
for their nefarious activities.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.025 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So was
there a time period

00:20:51.025 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:84%
after you got out of
the military which

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:84%
you thought maybe they weren't
watching or there wasn't any?

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I thought for a
time that you know, OK,

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:84%
that was all just a
strange chapter that I

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.120 align:middle line:90%
was able to put behind me.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But I recall being back in
civilian life afterwards

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and still seeing strange Crown
Victoria sedan following me

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:90%
or trailing me.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I'd stop to go look at
it or to approach the vehicle,

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.180 align:middle line:90%
they'd leave.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, it
eventually got to a point

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.650 align:middle line:90%
where I stopped seeing them.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it was
an observation trailing

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.880 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that the
cover story that they used

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle line:90%
was sticking.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.190 align:middle line:90%
And for me it did.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How about your jobs
that you had after this?

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Is there any
possibility that you

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
were being assisted
in getting employed

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.685 align:middle line:84%
at the places you
were getting employed

00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle line:90%
at so they could watch you?

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There is a chance
that that was the case.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:84%
However, I had a
really hard time

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.750 align:middle line:84%
after I got out, because
I think that they

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:84%
had intended on me finishing
out a military career back

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted no part of that.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:90%
I had just gotten there--

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You had 40 years of it.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: All of a
sudden, I'm not--

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.220 align:middle line:90%
no way.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:90%
I was done.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You wanted out.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I wanted out.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So did you get
a job when you got out?

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I had a hard
time finding one,

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:90%
but I did get a job.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: In the field
you wanted to be in?

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: In the field I wanted to
be in, doing engineering work.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The memories
started coming back,

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.180 align:middle line:90%
and now you're here.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: And now I'm here.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.919 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The one thing
I do understand

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:84%
is the expense they
had to go through

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:84%
to put you through this
20 and Back ordeal.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't they just get
rid of you, and that was it?

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.929 align:middle line:84%
Why not just leave
us on some planet

00:22:37.929 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of nowhere?

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You're no
problem anymore.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Because now you've got a chance
you may get your memories back,

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.740 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So they've got
that to deal with.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.450 align:middle line:90%
But explain it to me.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, part of the reason
is that the technology

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.520 align:middle line:84%
that they used for
the age regression

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.670 align:middle line:84%
was given to them
by an alien race.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And the agreements
that they signed,

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the contracts that
they agreed to,

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:84%
required that they would do
everything within their power

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.970 align:middle line:84%
to return each of the
recipients of that technology

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
back to the original
departure place, location

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.482 align:middle line:90%
of where they were taken from.

00:23:15.482 --> 00:23:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What we have
to come to understand

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.940 align:middle line:84%
here is that these
organizations, the Secret Space

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Program and all
their affiliates,

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:84%
they have a set
of rules not only

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:84%
with the contracts with aliens,
but also among themselves.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And they have to follow
those rules, right?

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Even the mafia has their own
set of rules that they follow.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And the SSP programs
are no different.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:84%
They have boundaries that they
can skirt right up to the line,

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:84%
but they have to stay
within those boundaries,

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.799 align:middle line:84%
as far as the rules that
they do have to follow.

00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is everything
like signed for?

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:84%
There's paperwork
going on constantly

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.680 align:middle line:90%
among the different factions?

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's going on?

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There's a paper
trail that they have--

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.070 align:middle line:84%
digital, but still
nonetheless it

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
is their own method of
tracking their madness.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:90%
And they do follow it.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of
the things that we

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:18.360 align:middle line:84%
had to go through in our initial
training was the supply system.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And included in that is how
do you order new supplies?

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:90%
How do you get them?

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:84%
What if you're deployed, and
how do you get them delivered?

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are multitude
of ways that you

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:84%
can have things dropped
off to you, literally,

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:37.320 align:middle line:84%
from space or via space shuttle,
or brought in or handed over

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:90%
from another unit.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.722 align:middle line:90%
So yes--

00:24:40.722 --> 00:24:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Everything
is accounted for.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Everything
is accounted for.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Every last nanite.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Who were the
aliens that gave us

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:84%
the 20 and Back technology,
and why did they do it?

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: My understanding is that
the technology was originally

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.930 align:middle line:90%
given to the Mars Germans.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And as part of one of the
agreements that they used

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:84%
for technology transfer,
even though they were giving

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:84%
something in exchange
for this, they still

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.966 align:middle line:84%
had rules that
they had to follow.

00:25:04.966 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And this came from Johan,
that you got this information?

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Per Johan the alien race
that made the trade with them,

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I suspect--

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.240 align:middle line:84%
now, Johan never said
this, but I suspect

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:90%
it was one of the Nordics.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's just one
of my suspicions.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the
Germans also received

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.760 align:middle line:84%
the mind wipe technology
from an alien group,

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.880 align:middle line:84%
possibly the Nordics,
too, I don't know.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.117 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I suspect that
particular technology

00:25:31.117 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:90%
came from the Draco.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: The Draco.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Through one of
their assisted developments.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do you have any
hypothesis on how the mind

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.280 align:middle line:90%
right technology works?

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, I know
that the programming--

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what they call it--

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
the segmented and
compartmentalized programming

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:84%
that's used allows them to
selectively program the people

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:04.050 align:middle line:84%
that they need to with go
words, with mission goals,

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:84%
with compartmentalizing
secrets, information.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
They're able to use
it to great effect

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
for compartmentalization and
keeping people in the dark.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
The process involved,
from my own experience,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.850 align:middle line:84%
has been a combination
of pharmaceuticals.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I understand that originally the
pharmaceuticals that they used

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.710 align:middle line:84%
only generated about
a 90% success rate,

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and that over time they
were able to refine that

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:44.310 align:middle line:84%
down to a 1% to 3%
failure rate based

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.860 align:middle line:84%
on the combination
of pharmaceuticals

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and the technology.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Understanding magnetics and
fields and the experiences

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.830 align:middle line:84%
that I've had with the multiple
different types of weapons

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:84%
systems and seeing
how they operate,

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that the fields,
as well as the waves that

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.470 align:middle line:84%
are emitted from the
technology for mind wipe,

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:13.440 align:middle line:84%
are energy based that affects
the electrical systems

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:90%
of the mind.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.270 align:middle line:84%
As far as where and how
medically, that is something

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:19.115 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:19.115 --> 00:27:23.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, part of the process
for the initial training

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:27.330 align:middle line:84%
was to establish baseline
psychological as well

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:90%
as medical.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.530 align:middle line:84%
But the psychological
baselines that they established

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:84%
were based on how they're
going to use that mind wipe

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:41.690 align:middle line:84%
technology to great effect, to
get the best and most efficient

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.445 align:middle line:84%
mind wipe that they
were able to get.

00:27:44.445 --> 00:27:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
something that they

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
were able to do immediately
overnight, to come in

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, let me
reprogram somebody.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.220 align:middle line:90%
It takes a little bit of time.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Even with the
advanced technology,

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.350 align:middle line:90%
they had to establish baselines.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, they can do
that surreptitiously

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
without you ever even
knowing that they're

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:90%
getting an idea for baselines.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:84%
They have somebody
come up and ask

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.660 align:middle line:84%
you a series of questions
or a question that

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.710 align:middle line:84%
recalls a certain memory from
a period in time in which they

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.520 align:middle line:84%
can then identify
it remotely to be

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.250 align:middle line:90%
able to control or to target.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they find
out if the mind wipe

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.780 align:middle line:84%
worked by asking
for a memory recall,

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and then they find where
they have to wipe it out.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So it's a continuing
process in a way.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So you were probably
mind wiped quite a bit

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:90%
over your time period.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: A bunch.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And that's going to
be another problem for you

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:37.440 align:middle line:90%
to remember.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Walter
Bowart wrote a book

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.940 align:middle line:84%
called "Operation Mind Control"
about 25 years ago it came out.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about
this discovery

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:84%
that people who had
been MK altered,

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that the effects
of the programming

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:84%
actually only lasted
about 20 years.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And so most people
rolling into their 40s

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.460 align:middle line:84%
would start having
these memory recalls.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.364 align:middle line:84%
And this actually
started in about 1985

00:29:04.364 --> 00:29:05.780 align:middle line:84%
that the recall
started happening,

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:84%
which meant that these
people had been mind

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:90%
wiped in the '60s probably.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Is there like something
to this, do you think,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:90%
as an experiencer?

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.580 align:middle line:84%
About like at 20 years,
the original field

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.160 align:middle line:84%
start coming back into
coherence or something?

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, I think
that some of it has to do,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.260 align:middle line:84%
based on my own
experiences, it has

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:28.820 align:middle line:84%
to do with the
personal progression.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.300 align:middle line:84%
The individual spiritual
progression, if you will.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And the change in
consciousness that people have.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Generally to begin with
around the age of 40,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.000 align:middle line:84%
you start going
through what's referred

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:84%
to in many places as
the midlife crisis.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.584 align:middle line:84%
Or you go through
and change your mind.

00:29:45.584 --> 00:29:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The dark
night of the soul.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.333 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Dark nights of the soul.

00:29:48.333 --> 00:29:51.890 align:middle line:84%
People have a
stronger understanding

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:84%
of their mortality, the
people that they know die

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and family and friends
start passing away.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And so an individual's
spiritual growth

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:07.080 align:middle line:84%
generally starts happening
around that time anyway.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I think a
combination of things

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:13.430 align:middle line:84%
happened with me is that my
own individual spirituality

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:90%
changing.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's fields that it is
passing through and currently

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:84%
experiencing has an
effect on that as well.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:84%
The changing consciousness
of the people on the planet

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:28.430 align:middle line:90%
has an effect on that.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:32.690 align:middle line:84%
There is never one thing
to blame for anything,

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and this is certainly
an example of that

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.210 align:middle line:84%
is that there isn't
one reason why

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I think the memories came
back the way they did

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:90%
and as much as they have.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.930 align:middle line:84%
But there were a combination
of factors that played into it.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you have
any physical symptoms

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.570 align:middle line:84%
when you came back
from the 20 and Back,

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:90%
or were you just like normal?

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: All of the enhancements
that they had provided to me

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.030 align:middle line:90%
were removed.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:90%
All of the nanites were removed.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.360 align:middle line:84%
When I was returned,
it was as if I'd

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:12.600 align:middle line:84%
been returned with a five
day hangover and a bad cold.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.060 align:middle line:90%
I felt terrible.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:90%
My entire body ached.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.090 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing in
the way of enhancements.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I was back to the exact same
size, weight, fat content,

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that I had when I left,
they mapped it out,

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.550 align:middle line:84%
had it written down
or recorded somewhere,

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:38.090 align:middle line:84%
so they knew exactly where they
needed to bring me back to.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Part of the out-process
also included

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:84%
making sure that the bio rhythms
matched as far as the cycle.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So that day I was returned
back to the same place that I

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.230 align:middle line:84%
was to try and part
of the process--

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.960 align:middle line:84%
again, part of those rules
that we talked about--

00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.290 align:middle line:84%
is returning me to the
point that I was taken

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and returning me in
every way that they

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:06.170 align:middle line:90%
could as original as possible.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're one
of the few people

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I get to talk to that's
actually be to Area 51.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:90%
What was it like there?

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The out-processing that
they put us through at Area 51,

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I did not give
tours or get tours.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I was there just as a layover.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:25.670 align:middle line:84%
They made sure that
they kept a close watch.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I was very
interested in it.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I knew what the area was
about, and that there

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.910 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of
information out there

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:35.240 align:middle line:84%
about things that had
happened even before I'd

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.870 align:middle line:84%
gone into information
blackout in the SSP.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I knew that it was a
secret base that they'd

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:84%
done a lot of confidential
and classified research.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I was this close
to being out, and I

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.090 align:middle line:90%
wasn't about to mess it up.

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:84%
The facilities
that I did see were

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.280 align:middle line:84%
your run of the mill
1950s buildings,

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.640 align:middle line:90%
or look alike buildings.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Block, red brick,
aircraft aprons

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:13.400 align:middle line:84%
for landing strips or runways,
the individual quarters

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.220 align:middle line:84%
that I was in, which were
basically a room with a bed.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They weren't going
to show you anything anyway.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:90%
No, they weren't.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I was not on a need to know.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: When they were
processing you out at Area 51,

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.910 align:middle line:84%
did you ever get told that
you weren't supposed to talk

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:29.990 align:middle line:90%
about what had happened?

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Or how did they handle that?

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The personnel at
Area 51 stayed away from me.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like people were
beating on my door to say, hey,

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.640 align:middle line:90%
where have you been?

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.971 align:middle line:90%
And what have you done?

00:33:43.971 --> 00:33:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But how about
your superiors?

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Did they tell you at
any point that you were

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.900 align:middle line:90%
to shut up about what you saw?

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Or the big joke was you weren't
going to remember anything

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.580 align:middle line:90%
anyway, right?

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, that
was the big joke.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:00.620 align:middle line:84%
That from day one, we were not
to tell anybody anything that

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:90%
wasn't on a need to know.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah that
wasn't anything unique

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.630 align:middle line:84%
or special to my
arrival at Area 51.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Standard
operating procedure.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:13.204 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That had been
the SOP from day one.

00:34:13.204 --> 00:34:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask questions you don't
need to know the answers to,

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and don't tell anybody
unless they show you

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.380 align:middle line:90%
that they have a need to know.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you were
trained well in this?

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And we were
trained very well in that.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You had an evolution
of your spiritual beliefs

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.209 align:middle line:90%
through this time period?

00:34:28.209 --> 00:34:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I would say
it was a stronger

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:34.670 align:middle line:84%
faith in my spiritual beliefs
and reconnection to that.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.276 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you came out in
the end a better person?

00:34:37.276 --> 00:34:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I believe so.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you were
being followed,

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.770 align:middle line:90%
that seems either way, I guess.

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.929 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you're being
followed and watched now,

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:46.699 align:middle line:84%
and are you afraid
that you're coming out

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
bring the dogs on again?

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, there's
always the risk

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:84%
that the things
that I have to say

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.810 align:middle line:84%
are going to upset certain
people or upset certain plans,

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:00.980 align:middle line:84%
or bring to the light the
things that have happened.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And the whole purpose
of me being here

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:07.550 align:middle line:84%
is to help with the process,
the evolution, of disclosure.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I wouldn't
be human if I

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.380 align:middle line:84%
wasn't concerned about the
safety of myself or my family.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:19.510 align:middle line:84%
However, I'd say that I don't
feel threatened currently

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.640 align:middle line:84%
as far as people watching
me or looking out for me.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I have always tried to
maintain positive control

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.540 align:middle line:84%
of my environment, and paying
attention to where I'm at

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm doing and who
I talk to and the things

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.660 align:middle line:90%
that I go through.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.220 align:middle line:84%
By no means am I
invulnerable, but there

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.750 align:middle line:84%
are certain precautions
that you can

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:42.790 align:middle line:90%
take to safeguard those things.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:46.550 align:middle line:90%
And I certainly do those things.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, I think
you're going to be fine.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I know I will.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.220 align:middle line:90%
I know I will.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Hey, Jason, it's been
great having you on the show.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Thank you.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
all about disclosure.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.520 align:middle line:10%
ANNOUNCER: Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure," where

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.310 align:middle line:10%
people share their clandestine
involvement with government

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:07.684 align:middle line:10%
agencies, the military,
and secret space programs.

00:36:07.684 --> 00:36:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> But the beings that are out
there that are playing with

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:84%
their genetics and their
spiritual light bodies are very

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:90%
interested in some of our DNA.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> They will only get involved
if we're going to destroy

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.230 align:middle line:84%
the planet or destroy more
than half the population.
