00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:10%
a retired Special Agent who
served in the Air Force Office

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.640 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And was intimately involved
with UFO/ET-related content.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us about what you
know about Project Serpo.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Project Serpo actually
is project Crystal Knight In

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:84%
2005, I was in a funeral
at Washington Dc,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
when a Colonel came
to me and said Rick,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:84%
what do you know about
Project Crystal Knight?

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't think
I've ever heard of it.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And he told me it was
an exchange program

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.770 align:middle line:84%
between the Eben's of the
craft that crashed in 1947

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.943 align:middle line:90%
and us and our astronauts.

00:01:05.943 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, I never
heard of that.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But I'd be interested in
knowing more about it.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.195 align:middle line:90%
So we went into another room.

00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:84%
After we left the funeral
parlor with the reception,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
we went into another
room at a hotel.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:90%
And he told me about it.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And I said, boy, that
doesn't sound right.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:84%
I certainly wasn't around
back in the '50s or '60s,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.510 align:middle line:90%
but what happened?

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And he went on to tell me that
when the Eben craft crashed

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.330 align:middle line:90%
at Roswell, they found it.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
They had an energy
device in there.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that energy
device because we still

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:90%
have that energy device.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But the Eben-- the Eben One told
us there was a communications

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:90%
device in the craft.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And the communications device
could help him notify his home

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:90%
planet to come get him.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Come help me out.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And so over a period
of about 10 years,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
it took the US government
to create or manufacture

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:84%
a communications system
that could send signals

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to this Serpo, which was the
name of the planet the US

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:84%
government named in Zeta
Reticuli star system.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Some 40-- about 39.5
light years away.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:90%
And we did it.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.340 align:middle line:90%
We notified them.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was a project to
learn the Eben language.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Now Eben One started us on that.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
It was a very difficult
language because it was tones.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It was a very difficult
language to learn.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But he wrote down his
alphabet so we at least

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.610 align:middle line:90%
had his alphabet.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:90%
All the symbols in his alphabet.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But we, as a pretty
intelligent group of people,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.780 align:middle line:90%
figured it out.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to communicate
with the other planet.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Now this is what this
Colonel is telling me.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Now in October of
2005, Victor Martinez,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
he had an email stream that
he used for a number of years.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:84%
A number of people
on that stream.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
He contacted me
and he said, I have

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.150 align:middle line:84%
this guy that's contacted
me and said he was with DIA.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to start
releasing information

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:90%
about a Project Crystal Knight.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything
about it, Rick?

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
know what, Victor?

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:90%
I do know something about it.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if
it's real or if it's

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
some kind of military
project that had happened.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.755 align:middle line:90%
An exercise.

00:03:38.755 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could think of
a lot of different things.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>> And he said, no, no, no.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I know it's real because I've
seen some evidence of it.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, what kind of
evidence did you see?

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:84%
He said, I saw
pictures of the planet.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, you saw
pictures of what planet?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:90%
He said, Serpo.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.920 align:middle line:90%
I said who showed them to you?

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.200 align:middle line:84%
He said this person that I
want to introduce you to.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:90%
So I flew out to--

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I was still working
for Austin, Texas

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and I flew out to
California, Oceanside.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Met with Victor and then, I met
with this former DIA official

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:90%
named Joseph Yeager.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Joseph knew me.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know him.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:90%
He knew of me.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Knew of my time in OSI
and US Intelligence.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:90%
He had worked for DIA.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
He was at the, we call
it, the no hat office

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:90%
in the UFO desk in DIA.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And we call it no hat because
their heads are so big,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:90%
their heads wouldn't fit.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:90%
It was a joke.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Anyways, he said,
are you ready for this--

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:90%
to hear about this project?

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
is it for real?

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah, it's for real.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you got any
documents to prove it?

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:90%
He says, come to my house.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And we were at a hotel
meeting at some--

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:90%
in Oceanside, California.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:90%
So we went to his house.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:90%
He lived in a really nice house.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.333 align:middle line:90%
He had a cellar.

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's not too many places
that have cellars anymore,

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:84%
but he had a cellar in
his house in California.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.535 align:middle line:84%
And we went in there and he
had these safes along the wall.

00:05:14.535 --> 00:05:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Probably, a dozen safes.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were
GAS-approved safes.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:90%
So they were GAS safes.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And having worked
in a government,

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:90%
you how secure they are.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>> He opened one up and
brought a document over to me.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Laid it down.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.542 align:middle line:84%
It was an Air
Force OSI document.

00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:33.125 align:middle line:84%
I looked at that document and,
of course, I recognized being I

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:34.910 align:middle line:90%
had been in the OSI.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:90%
He said, read that.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:90%
It was a real thick document.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So I spent the next
probably, 30 or 35 minutes

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:90%
going through this document.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:90%
I said, holy cow.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I spent all those years in OSI
and I never heard about this.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:90%
So I said, so it's for real?

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's
absolutely for real.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Then he started pulling out
other things and showing us--

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:90%
showing me and Victor.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, why
do you have it here?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
This should be in a file
of a DIA headquarters.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.880 align:middle line:90%
How did you get it?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I can't
answer that question.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, and if you turn
me over to the feds,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.245 align:middle line:90%
those documents won't be here.

00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm not going to
turn you over to the feds.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, is this
still classified?

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:90%
He said, I don't know.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.780 align:middle line:90%
And I don't really care.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:90%
I want it out in the public.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So what was the most
powerful thing you read in that

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.155 align:middle line:90%
document, over that 35 minutes?

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
What really shocked
you the most?

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Beside you not knowing about it.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what shocked me was how
they selected the astronauts.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>> How did they?

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they selected--

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:84%
it took them months
and months and months,

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:84%
but they got people that--
they had to get specialists.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Doctors and other specialists.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
But they went out
and found people

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
within the military that
were orphans and didn't

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.400 align:middle line:84%
have any family members
and weren't married.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a difficult
task, even in 1960

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:90%
when this was occurring.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:90%
But they found them.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:84%
They found, I think, 100 or
so and they narrowed it down.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:84%
They put these astronauts
through an enormous amount

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:90%
of training.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:84%
In reading and then
listening to a tape recording

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:84%
later of all the training
they went through,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean Special Forces SEALs
wouldn't have even gone

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:90%
through this kind of stuff.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
But they had to prepare them
for a journey from Earth,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.548 align:middle line:84%
39 light years away
to a foreign planet.

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.090 align:middle line:84%
How do you prepare
somebody for that?

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they tried it.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:90%
And they did it.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, according to
them, they did it.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And that was the most
fascinating thing--

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.860 align:middle line:90%
how they chose they 12.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Now the controversy
is, according to him,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:90%
there were 12 men.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.920 align:middle line:84%
According to this other person
that became involved later,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:90%
said no.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.458 align:middle line:90%
There were 10 men, two women.

00:07:52.458 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:90%
There were two women that went.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:90%
One was a linguist.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.870 align:middle line:90%
She learned the Eben language.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So there was some controversy
there whether there were

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:90%
two women or not two women.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.160 align:middle line:90%
But anyways, they were trained.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
They were set up
to go on a mission.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And the craft that--
the Eben's were supposed

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:84%
to come in 1964 to White Sands
and Holloman Air Force base,

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:84%
but that blew up because
the one Eben craft

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:90%
didn't land at Holloman.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:25.010 align:middle line:84%
It landed near Socorro and that
was Lonnie Zamora incident,

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.200 align:middle line:90%
in 1964.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
When they eventually found
the right landing space,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:84%
in White Sands, it was
decided that the Eben's

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:90%
weren't ready for it.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:90%
So then they scheduled for 1965.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to
leave out of Groom Lake--

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.909 align:middle line:90%
Area 51.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And the craft-- a
huge craft landed.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
About 40 tons of material
that we brought on with us--

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.640 align:middle line:90%
the Ebens took.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And they went on their
voyage, the 12, to Serpo.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.098 align:middle line:84%
>> Did we have any of
their races stay back?

00:09:01.098 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> We have an exchange program.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.010 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:05.810 align:middle line:90%
One ET stayed.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:90%
Eben Two they called him.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:90%
Eben Two stayed and our 12 went.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And we had the
communications device

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that we could still communicate
with our people on Serpo.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:84%
We were communicating
with them, I

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
think, once every seven
months or something like that.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:84%
It took, like, 40 hours
for the signal to get back.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Something to that effect.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But we still
communicated with them.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually adjusted
to the life on Serpo.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems they
had up there was two suns.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:90%
There's a binary planet.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:90%
So there was never any darkness.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:90%
It was always daylight.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:84%
No they took
sunglasses with them.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:84%
But the radiation
exposure was higher there.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:90%
The Ebens were accustomed to it.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:90%
They weren't.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So every one of them had
a radiation problem--

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:84%
radiation sickness
when they got back.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
of the problems.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So while you're in
Joseph Yeager's cellar,

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:84%
looking at all this information,
you told me that there was

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.510 align:middle line:84%
actually pictures he
had of the planet.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Could you describe what
you saw in these pictures?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The crew-- the 12 person
astronaut crew took a lot

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.080 align:middle line:90%
of cameras with them.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So they took a lot of
photography, photos.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And he showed us pictures of
some-- he didn't show us a lot.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But he showed us
some of the pictures.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Pictures of the crew when
they arrived on Serpo.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And pictures of the
area that they stayed in

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:90%
for the first year or so.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:90%
Pretty desert-like.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Desert-like.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.848 align:middle line:90%
>> It was pretty desert-like.

00:10:38.848 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:84%
But there were different
areas of the planet

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that was less desert than
where they had landed.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Where they landed was the
central home area of the Ebens

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Over the next
year, they realized

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:84%
that they were getting
a lot of radiation.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And the heat there was a
tremendous amount of heat.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So they Ebens decided
to move them north.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:84%
The northern part of the planet
was cooler-- a lot cooler.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they
actually had seen snow

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.295 align:middle line:84%
on that planet, which
was really, something

00:11:12.295 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:90%
of an anomaly.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But they moved north by
some hundreds of miles.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And they set up camp-- the
Ebens did-- for them up there.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lot cooler,
by 30 or 40 degrees.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:90%
It was still in the 60s and 70s.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
But they were more
comfortable there,

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:84%
in the northern
part of the planet.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And those pictures, we had
pictures of the northern area.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.450 align:middle line:90%
They had some vegetation, trees.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:90%
They had a river--

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.830 align:middle line:90%
looked like a river.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there an atmosphere,
like a blue atmosphere?

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> There was an atmosphere
that was consistent with Earth.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
It had more of an oxygen
content than Earth,

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:90%
but they adjusted to it.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:90%
They had these--

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.663 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.663 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember what
they called them--

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
but they put these masks on
that blocked some of the oxygen

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:84%
that they were breathing
because it was a higher oxygen.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, the scientists
with them told them--

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.980 align:middle line:90%
or the doctors with them--

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:90%
we can adjust.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:84%
We just have to go out for
a longer period of time.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually adjusted
over a period of years.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:90%
They just adjusted to there.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing they
really had problems with

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:90%
were the two suns and the heat.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
The daytime heat was a
constant 115, 120 degrees.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Were there buildings?

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Were they underground?

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
What did the
buildings look like?

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.640 align:middle line:90%
The structures?

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The Ebens lived in almost,
looked like adobe buildings.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Clay or some type of
an adobe building.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:84%
The crew stayed in an
underground bunker.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
if the Ebens built

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:90%
that or it was already there.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:84%
But it was cooler
the first year.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.927 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, then they
moved north after that.

00:12:52.927 --> 00:12:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have a problem
with the heat after that.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Besides the vegetation, were
there any animal life or mammal

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:84%
life other than
what we see here?

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
There were creatures
on the planet.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.972 align:middle line:84%
The crew encountered--
they were out exploring.

00:13:06.972 --> 00:13:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And every time they
went out, they always

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:90%
had Ebens with them.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And we could communicate
because some of the Ebens

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:90%
spoke English.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:84%
In a broken manner, but
they still could speak it.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And we had, of
course, two linguists

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:90%
that could speak some Eben.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.250 align:middle line:84%
It was still difficult for
the Ebens to understand.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.650 align:middle line:84%
We understood the Ebens better
than the Ebens understood us

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:90%
in their language.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.780 align:middle line:84%
But they traveled-- the crew
traveled all over the planet.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They encountered creatures
that looked like snakes.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.220 align:middle line:90%
That were hostile.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.625 align:middle line:90%
Some of were not hostile.

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
They found some animals
that looked like armadillos.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:84%
They found this
huge, huge creature

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that kind of looked like
a buffalo, in a way,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:90%
but was not hostile.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:90%
They found some smaller insects.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
There were some
occasions, according

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.990 align:middle line:84%
to this report, where there was
some hostilities that occurred.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
One particular one was when
one of the crew members died.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.520 align:middle line:90%
They Ebens took the body.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
The commander, he said,
I want the body back.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:90%
And they said, no.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:90%
You can't have him back.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:90%
So there was some hostilities.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And the commander
ordered weapons

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:90%
to be issued to everyone.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
get our body back.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, there was one Eben--

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:84%
a female Eben that
was a translator

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.840 align:middle line:90%
that defused everything.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.260 align:middle line:90%
She was a mediator.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And according this
report, every time

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:84%
there was some kind of
hostilery or argument,

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:84%
she would mediate
it and settle it.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.837 align:middle line:84%
So she actually
settled this problem

00:14:47.837 --> 00:14:49.920 align:middle line:84%
before they actually had
to break out the weapons.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they know why
this astronaut died?

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure it said in there.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm not--

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>> There was two
astronauts that died.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.208 align:middle line:84%
There was two
astronauts that died.

00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:90%
One died in a--

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
they had these flying machines
like little helicopters,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.050 align:middle line:84%
but they were more
advanced than that.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, he
tried to fly one

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:90%
and he got killed in a crash.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was five or six
years into the mission.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they venturing not
only on the planet, but off,

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:90%
planet near planet areas?

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:84%
They stayed there
on that planet.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>> The Ebens wouldn't let them.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:84%
There was dangers that the
Ebens kept telling them.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's dangerous if
you go here and go here.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
really know what.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But one of the thing that's
interesting in this report

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:84%
was that the body of
the American that died

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.460 align:middle line:90%
was taken into this building.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, this
mediator allowed

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
negotiated two of the
Americans-- the commander

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:55.986 align:middle line:84%
and the assistant commander--
to go into this building

00:15:55.986 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:90%
to get the body.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
to bury the body.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.200 align:middle line:90%
And they saw all these vats.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And they were asking
the interpreter,

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:90%
what are these vats?

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And when they got
up, that American

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.620 align:middle line:90%
was in one of these vats.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:90%
He said, we're cloning races.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.957 align:middle line:84%
Were there other
races there, Rick,

00:16:22.957 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:84%
that they were exposed
to besides the Ebens.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:27.332 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the commander,
there was many different races

00:16:27.332 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:90%
that they were cloning.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.790 align:middle line:84%
They were doing biological
experiments on all of them.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what really
upset the commander.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.260 align:middle line:84%
He said you're not going to
do on my crew member's body.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's something like a formal
procedure that the Ebens do.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
One of our people die,
we do the same thing.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:90%
But the head Eben said, OK.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.880 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want it done,
you can take the body

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.340 align:middle line:90%
and we'll have a burial.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And they did they
did a burial for him.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Were the Ebens spiritual
at all or religious?

00:16:57.675 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Did they mention
anything about--

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:90%
did they have a deity?

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they did.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:84%
They worshiped this deity
every day at a certain time.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:90%
There was a time dial--

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:84%
like an old time dial in the
village or in the location.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.740 align:middle line:90%
They called it the village.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And when it reached
a certain place,

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:84%
they would pray or do some
kind of religious service

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.430 align:middle line:90%
to their deity.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know that we ever
figured out who the deity was

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.410 align:middle line:90%
or whether it was a God or what.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that, that was
ever mentioned in there.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But our people just
had to go to there--

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.990 align:middle line:84%
we couldn't be out when
they were doing it.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
We had to-- and it was just
a protocol that, hey, you

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:90%
can't see us doing this.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So all our people went to their
bunker and stayed a while.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:84%
It didn't last very
long, according

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
to the team commander, who
wrote these transcripts that we

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.662 align:middle line:90%
were reading.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they mention anything
about the food or water?

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Or did they just eat their own
food and water they brought?

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, back then,
it was C-rations.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And they brought food with
them-- canned food up.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:84%
They eventually just
ate the Eben food.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And they had-- it
was plant-based.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Almost all plant-based.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.790 align:middle line:84%
They had some meat
that tasted very funny,

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:90%
but they adjusted to it.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I think they said after
a period of a few months,

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:84%
when their bodies were
adjusting to this food,

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.670 align:middle line:90%
they were all right.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.880 align:middle line:84%
But before that, they were
getting diarrhea and problems

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.260 align:middle line:90%
with the intestinal tract.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.385 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, the body
adjusted to these plant-based

00:18:43.385 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:90%
and maybe, animal.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:50.065 align:middle line:84%
They had some kind of animal
that they used to eat.

00:18:50.065 --> 00:18:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, how big was this
planet compared to Earth?

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
gravitational pull on that?

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The gravity was a little bit
different, but they adjusted.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.670 align:middle line:84%
They wore plates
in their boots--

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:90%
military boots.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.840 align:middle line:90%
And they adjusted to gravity.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly, the team
commander said we adjusted.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:90%
How we adjusted, I don't know.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.178 align:middle line:90%
But we adjusted.

00:19:13.178 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
They adjusted to a lot
of different things.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
The climate, the other
things, they adjusted to.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But they just adjusted
to the gravity.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:84%
The planet was a little
bit smaller than Earth.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Not much.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:30.032 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember the
diameter or the particulars.

00:19:30.032 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the
culture there like?

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Do they have restaurants
and bars they could go to?

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Were there athletic clubs?

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Were there spas or pools
that the astronauts

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:84%
could mingle in with the
other extraterrestrials?

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Nothing like this.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.980 align:middle line:90%
Everyone looked the same.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.720 align:middle line:90%
All Ebens look the same.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
They all lived in
these adobe houses.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And they had their
family there--

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:90%
male, female, and children.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
The crew never saw more
than two children to anyone.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
They weren't allowed in any
one of the Eben residence.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:84%
There was no-- everyone ate
at a facility- one facility,

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:90%
like a dining hall or something.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, cafeteria

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> They didn't eat.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:90%
They didn't cook their own food.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:90%
Everyone went to one place.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was rigidly controlled.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
The team commander said they had
something like a police force,

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.870 align:middle line:84%
but there was no
hostilities, whatsoever.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Never saw any fights or any
reasons for the police force

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:90%
to act.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he said the police
force were out of sight.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.650 align:middle line:84%
If something was to
happen, they would show up.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.460 align:middle line:90%
And they did have a military.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:90%
They did have an Air Force.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
They did have a very
sophisticated aircrafts

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and flying objects--

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:84%
they call them-- and these
little helicopters that

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.090 align:middle line:90%
would fly any place around.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:84%
But they never saw
any hostilities

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:90%
in all the time they were there.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:90%
No fights.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:84%
The one time the
police showed up

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.350 align:middle line:84%
was when the team
commander was going

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.780 align:middle line:84%
to get the guns to
go get the body back.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.940 align:middle line:84%
There was some security forces
came up and they had weapons.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't bother him.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:90%
They were just there.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.120 align:middle line:84%
The team commander said
they were just present.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Just showed their presence
like, here we are.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you shouldn't
mess with us.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Something to that
effect, that way.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:90%
But it was a unique system.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was the same.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Everybody went and did this--

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:90%
eat together.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>> How beautiful.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> They played this game
that he was talking about,

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:46.170 align:middle line:84%
that was something like soccer,
but it was totally different.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was different.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.250 align:middle line:84%
The closest thing
they could relate to.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And they would laugh and they
would have fun with this game.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the team members went
out there and played football

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.390 align:middle line:84%
or softball-- because they
bought that equipment with

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:90%
them--

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:84%
the Ebens thought
that was amazing.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to teach
the Ebens how of play.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
But in the Eben game, you
didn't catch anything.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:90%
You let me hit the ground.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.855 align:middle line:84%
So in softball, the
Ebens would just

00:22:12.855 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:84%
watch the ball hit the
ground and pick it up.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, no, no.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.287 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to catch it.

00:22:16.287 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was difficult, according
to the team commander.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:90%
But they tried.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:90%
And They worked with them.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.480 align:middle line:90%
They lived there for 13 years.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Got along.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What propulsion systems did
they have to travel 39 light

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:90%
years, in just 10 months?

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.663 align:middle line:90%
>> We wish we knew.

00:22:34.663 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
figured it out.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember a lot of
technology being in the report.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.860 align:middle line:84%
The team commander
figured it was the folding

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:84%
the space from one
point to another,

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:84%
enabling them to
get from another.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But this commander detailed the
trip in very, very detail form.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Articulated how sick
they got from the trip.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:84%
How disoriented they
were in the craft.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Didn't know if they were
standing up or upside down.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And the Ebens would
come in during the trip

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:90%
and they were strapped to seats.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And they would give
them this like,

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:84%
he referred to it
as like oatmeal.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Spoonfuls of it.

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:90%
And it immediately settled them.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:84%
It settled their stomach
and settled them.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't understand
how the Ebens would

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:90%
know to give this to a human.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Because a doctor on board
had other anti-sickness,

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:84%
anti-motion sickness medication
he could give his crew.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't working.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.480 align:middle line:84%
But the Eben gave
him was working.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Were there other countries
involved with the group

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:90%
of astronauts?

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just the
United States, Americans?

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Just the United States.

00:23:48.292 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Just the United States.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you aware of other
countries finding out about

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.240 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Were they concerned?

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The Russians found out about
it later, some years later.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Now did they do this also,
with the Russians and other

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:90%
countries?

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>> We think they did.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:84%
We really think they did it
with them and the Japanese.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.307 align:middle line:90%
>> What about the Germans?

00:24:11.307 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I never heard anything
about the Germans.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:90%
But I heard about--

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Japanese,

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The Japanese
and the Russians.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have any
firsthand knowledge of it.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:90%
I've heard it.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Read it.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.250 align:middle line:84%
But whether it actually
happened or not, I don't know.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happened to all those
astronauts that went to Zeta

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Reticuli?

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, what happened
to them to this day?

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they're all dead now.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The ones that came back, they
were suffering from radiation

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.040 align:middle line:90%
sickness.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
They got cancer of
the skin or lungs

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:90%
or other types of cancers.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.870 align:middle line:84%
One lived-- the last
one to live was actually

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:90%
the team commander.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.230 align:middle line:84%
He lived for a number
of years, but then he

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:84%
died about six or
seven years ago.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one that spoke
at the private UFO convention.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Wendelle Stevens got
him to speak at it.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> What was his name?

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:90%
McKeever.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:90%
His last name was McKeever.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:90%
And he was an amazing speaker.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:90%
He spoke from the heart.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:18.015 align:middle line:84%
He really, really
valued the Ebens.

00:25:18.015 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:90%
They were so tender-hearted.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:90%
They were compassionate.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.130 align:middle line:90%
He saw them all in their best.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.750 align:middle line:90%
He never saw them in the worst.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Even when our team
members got so upset

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:84%
with certain other things
that were occurring,

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.620 align:middle line:84%
that there were confrontations
between the Americans

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and the Ebens, the
Ebens never got upset.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:90%
There was always a mediation.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:84%
They always tried to, let's
just settle this down.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.770 align:middle line:84%
You're our guests
here and we'll just--

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:90%
And they always gave.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:84%
He said almost every time, the
Ebens gave in to the Americans.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Not every time, like
when they wanted

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
to visit the structure
or the homes of the--

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:00.890 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And they warned them
not to go in there.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And one tried and
he was escorted out.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And please don't
do that anymore.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.808 align:middle line:84%
But they visited their
industrial center.

00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:90%
There was an industrial center.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Not in the village,
but some distance away.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And all their industry was in
an area, maybe, 10 or 12 miles.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:84%
They made the food,
They made the aircrafts.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They made-- anything
that they needed

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.990 align:middle line:84%
was made in this
industrial complex.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Did they grow their food?

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.880 align:middle line:90%
Or a 3D print it?

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe make it by
some other modality?

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't remember.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I think they grew most of it
and there was some canning.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.450 align:middle line:84%
There was a facility they
used to make other food.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.515 align:middle line:90%
The food lacked taste.

00:26:55.515 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
they ran out when

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.400 align:middle line:84%
they started eating the Eben
food was salt and pepper.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.353 align:middle line:84%
And I think they took some
other stuff with them--

00:27:03.353 --> 00:27:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Tabasco sauce, probably, because
that was in the C-rations

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.297 align:middle line:90%
even back then.

00:27:07.297 --> 00:27:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But they ran out of all of that
because the Ebens' food didn't

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:90%
have any taste.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:14.542 align:middle line:84%
But they developed a way-- the
ingenuity-- while they were up

00:27:14.542 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:84%
in the northern
part of the planet,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:84%
they found a plant
they could chew on

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.750 align:middle line:90%
and it was mint-flavored.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, they asked the
Ebens, is this good?

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Ebens said, yeah.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.400 align:middle line:90%
It won't hurt you.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens made
something out of it.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.570 align:middle line:90%


00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they determined
if they heated it,

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.630 align:middle line:90%
it would taste differently.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So they made their
own spices, basically.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the main
accomplishment of the US

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.010 align:middle line:90%
government to do this project?

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it was to
obtain technology--

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:84%
advanced technology
from the Ebens.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.870 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens are 5,000
years ahead of us

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:59.280 align:middle line:84%
so we could learn a
lot from the Ebens.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, they
were teaching us,

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:84%
but it was so far advanced, that
we just couldn't understand it.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, the commander told a story
about going in to a school--

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:16.120 align:middle line:90%
and they had schools--

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and trying to teach our
algebra to the Eben kids.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
it's Greek to them.

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:84%
They didn't understand
what we were trying to say.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But almost every one of them
realized what they were doing.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Ah, you're trying
to teach us math.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So then, the Ebens
started teaching us

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:44.340 align:middle line:84%
their math, which
was more advanced.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Different symbols and things.

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:51.090 align:middle line:84%
But we, especially the
scientists on the team,

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.450 align:middle line:90%
started grasping it.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I can understand this now.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.550 align:middle line:90%
I can understand this now.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And here are these scientists
that have doctorate degrees,

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.430 align:middle line:84%
are going back to grade
school-- or whatever school,

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:08.940 align:middle line:84%
whatever grade the
Ebens are learning in--

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.860 align:middle line:90%
and learning their math.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And learning their culture.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.340 align:middle line:90%
And learning their alphabet.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> If they were so advanced--
you say 5,000 years more

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.190 align:middle line:90%
advanced than we are--

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:84%
why were they doing things
like growing their own food,

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:90%
not just replicating it?

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're cloning bodies.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.902 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they're
probably cloning food.

00:29:28.902 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know that they
could answer that question.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a different-- they're
different races of creatures

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:90%
from another planet.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:90%
So very difficult to compare.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things the
commander told his crew is we

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:46.970 align:middle line:84%
have to forget what
we did on planet Earth

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and forget the customs, the
procedures, the courtesies we

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:51.410 align:middle line:90%
did.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:90%
This is a new world.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.010 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn
their way of doing it.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, their way is maybe
in technology, more advanced,

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.720 align:middle line:84%
but in other areas,
maybe it's less advanced.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And another thing they
did, that the commander--

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I remember reading about--

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.560 align:middle line:90%
was toilets.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:90%
They would save their wastes.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:90%
And at a certain--

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.740 align:middle line:90%
now their days were 36 hours.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.010 align:middle line:84%
At a certain time,
there would be

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:28.910 align:middle line:84%
a vehicle that would come up
and collect all the waste.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And was it-- they
couldn't ever figure out

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.660 align:middle line:84%
whether it was being
used for fertilizer

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:84%
or whether it was being
recycled some way.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Were they using it in some--.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:84%
They could never
figure this out.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Because the Ebens
wouldn't allow them to go

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.060 align:middle line:90%
to the industrial complex.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They went there to
view it, but they only

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.450 align:middle line:90%
went there once or twice.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And when they moved up
north, it was so far away,

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.460 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't get to it.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
why they did that.

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they collect the human's
waste, too, at the same time?

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.973 align:middle line:84%
>> They collected the
human's waste, too.

00:31:01.973 --> 00:31:03.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the next thing I
was going to tell you.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.640 align:middle line:84%
They would come down
and ask for our waste

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and, I guess, the
commander say, you want it.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.660 align:middle line:90%
You can have it.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.175 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.175 --> 00:31:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And another thing the
Ebens did was they

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:20.300 align:middle line:84%
made toilets that were different
than they had for the crew,

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.380 align:middle line:84%
which were more like American
toilets than Eben toilets.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And the commander
says, how would they

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.560 align:middle line:90%
know what our toilets are like?

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.900 align:middle line:84%
They must have been
visiting Earth a lot.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.120 align:middle line:84%
They must have been
in the houses--

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.665 align:middle line:84%
human houses to see that
we have a toilet like this.

00:31:35.665 --> 00:31:36.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:31:36.465 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have any information
about the different races

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.605 align:middle line:90%
of Ebens?

00:31:42.605 --> 00:31:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Because people
are saying they're

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:47.790 align:middle line:84%
being abducted by the
small greys and others

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.190 align:middle line:90%
say they're very helpful.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Do you think it's the same race?

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know that for a fact.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.220 align:middle line:90%
I've never been briefed in.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.968 align:middle line:84%
But I surmise they
were different.

00:31:58.968 --> 00:32:00.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't think the Ebens--

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Were hostile or
anything like that.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I think the other
greys are different.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, what the Ebens
did was they cloned

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and they created other
biological entities, even

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.820 align:middle line:90%
robotics.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.778 align:middle line:84%
Because the Americans on
the planet saw these robots.

00:32:17.778 --> 00:32:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And asked the Ebens,
what are these things?

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:20.902 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they're robots.

00:32:20.902 --> 00:32:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about them.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.130 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to hurt you.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.210 align:middle line:90%
They're just robots.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.200 align:middle line:90%
We created them.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.530 align:middle line:90%
But they looked like humans.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So they're a robotic biological
entity, but they were a robot.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And so if they
could do that, they

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.403 align:middle line:90%
could maybe make something else.

00:32:37.403 --> 00:32:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the other greys.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's only my opinion.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that for fact.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I agree with that.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.070 align:middle line:90%
I definitely agree with that.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Did we learn anything from being
with Ebens about our history?

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Where we came from?

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>> That is an extremely
controversial subject

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.890 align:middle line:90%
or question.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the Ebens told us
they'd been visiting Earth

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:90%
for approximately 2,000 years.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So that brings up a
whole lot of questions

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:09.030 align:middle line:84%
about the religious
aspect of Jesus

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:90%
and was Jesus a space man?

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that answer.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
even delve into it.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But that brings
up some questions.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.350 align:middle line:90%
And I don't have those answers.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that we ever--

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:27.120 align:middle line:84%
they told us that they
visited Earth 2,000 years ago.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they gave
us the Yellow Book.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:34.200 align:middle line:84%
The Yellow Book is a
holographic device.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.200 align:middle line:84%
That if you look at it, you have
to be sitting in front of it

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.670 align:middle line:90%
to look at it.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And it recorded
the Ebens history,

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.800 align:middle line:84%
including Ebens
history of Earth.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Now the ironic part about
this book is if you're German

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and you were
looking at it, you'd

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.340 align:middle line:90%
hear everything in German.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:59.063 align:middle line:84%
If I was Russian, I would
hear everything in Russian.

00:33:59.063 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Conscious-assisted
technology of some sort.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.943 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:34:02.943 --> 00:34:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there anything else
that we learned about ourselves

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.230 align:middle line:90%
and our history from this book?

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:13.159 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, I don't
know of anyone that actually

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.500 align:middle line:84%
was able to get through
the entire history

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.949 align:middle line:90%
of the Yellow Book.

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:20.900 align:middle line:84%
The problem with it is I never
saw it and I've never used it.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.870 align:middle line:84%
But the people that have,
including a very good friend

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.989 align:middle line:84%
of mine who was able
to look at it and he

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:29.179 align:middle line:90%
sat there for several hours.

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:84%
If you put it down and pull
it back up, starts all over,

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.507 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:38.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't read the fact
that you want to start it

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and there's no buttons
or anything to push.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So it might be impossible
to sit for 100 days

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.030 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is to look
at the whole history of what

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.630 align:middle line:84%
the Ebens have recorded
in his Yellow Book.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.669 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:54.469 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I know other researchers
such as Linda Moulton Howe

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.500 align:middle line:84%
have delved into that
more than I've heard of.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.130 align:middle line:84%
But that's all
I've read about it.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:08.020 align:middle line:84%
IT didn't go into a lot of
details about the Yellow Book.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Or our history.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The commander never said they
spoke about our history or--

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Only that they'd been
visiting Earth for 2,000 years.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know that there was
anything brought up about that,

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.220 align:middle line:90%
that I could remember.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible when they
came to visit us that they got

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:31.360 align:middle line:84%
into some sort of genetic
mutations or growing of beings

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.440 align:middle line:90%
or even hybrids?

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's been discussed.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
actual answer to that.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.340 align:middle line:84%
My own personal feeling
is it probably did.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I think their mentality--
the Ebens mentality, what

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I read out of
these documents, is

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.580 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
to do what they

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.960 align:middle line:84%
have to do to survive or create
a guarding force or whatever.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Because they had a--

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.170 align:middle line:84%
one thing that we
did find out, they

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:00.720 align:middle line:84%
had a battle with
another planet.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of thousands
of Ebens were killed.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And they finally made
peace with that planet.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.550 align:middle line:90%
It was in the same solar system.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.685 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.685 --> 00:36:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And they've maintained the
peace with this other planet.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.100 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Were they Ebens, too?

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.360 align:middle line:90%
They were a different race.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But some of those
from the other planet

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:31.580 align:middle line:84%
is what the commander is saying
that they Ebens are cloning.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.940 align:middle line:90%
So they have a safeguard.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.280 align:middle line:84%
They're safeguarding,
just in case.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.860 align:middle line:84%
They're going to do what
they have to do to survive.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Every planet's going to do this.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.127 align:middle line:90%
The problem with our planet--

00:36:42.127 --> 00:36:43.460 align:middle line:90%
we have so many different races.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:44.650 align:middle line:90%
So many different countries.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Their planet, they
have one race--

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Ebens.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.110 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:48.820 align:middle line:84%
There's no other
races on their planet.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.970 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't allow any
other races on their planet.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't allow
cross-breeding, either.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.740 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
that our scientists

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.450 align:middle line:90%
thought about doing.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And either artificially or
not-- and the Ebens said no.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.040 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you're
going to do that.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.760 align:middle line:90%
And we accepted it.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.873 align:middle line:84%
So the Ebens are going
to do what they have

00:37:10.873 --> 00:37:12.040 align:middle line:90%
to do to protect themselves.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:12.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Protect that race.

00:37:12.915 --> 00:37:13.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:13.715 --> 00:37:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened to the
Ebens with Project Serpo.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Are they still living
amongst us today?

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Eben Two, as far
as I know, is still here.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.280 align:middle line:90%
He's still out at Area 51.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Now as of 1991, he was.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know
where he's at now.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they ever
mention their lifespan?

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>> They have a long lifespan.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.230 align:middle line:90%
About 700 to 800 years.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, we found out that
according to the Ebens time

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:48.550 align:middle line:84%
period, time frame,
they could live

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:52.390 align:middle line:90%
600 or 700 years in Eben time.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know if anybody
actually sat down and figured

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.240 align:middle line:90%
out what that is in human time.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.630 align:middle line:90%
But they can live a long time.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Now with Product
Serpo becoming public,

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:08.130 align:middle line:84%
do you believe this
is a soft disclosure?

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Serpo became
public a long time ago.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.420 align:middle line:84%
There's been a
lot of controversy

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.880 align:middle line:90%
about that ever since.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And one particular Air Force
general said it's hogwash.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Never happened.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Well another government
employee came forth and said,

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:84%
it happened, but there were
only three astronauts that went.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.240 align:middle line:90%
So there's controversy.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think, the DIA placed
the controversy in there

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.800 align:middle line:90%
for the disclosure aspect of it.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.090 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Was there three
or were there 12?

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:44.070 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Did they actually go?

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Or was this some
sort of a major plot

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:53.860 align:middle line:84%
to condition the public
for a future disclosure?

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of questions
about Project Serpo that

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:57.700 align:middle line:90%
has never been answered.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
conjectures here and there.

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
misinformation here and there,

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:84%
spread by people writing books
about it that don't really

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.470 align:middle line:90%
know the truth.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:12.645 align:middle line:84%
But the truth, if you go back
and look at the documents,

00:39:12.645 --> 00:39:16.500 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
fascinated by the details

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.210 align:middle line:84%
that this commander
put in there.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things
he's describing,

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.060 align:middle line:84%
you can't be here on Earth and
describe some of this stuff

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.920 align:middle line:90%
that he's describing.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So even the best
science fiction writer

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.500 align:middle line:84%
couldn't write a
Project Serpo book.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, this stuff is
as real as it can get.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>> When you were in the basement
reading that document that you

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.850 align:middle line:84%
were privy to, did it state
how many astronauts in that

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:45.915 align:middle line:90%
document went?

00:39:45.915 --> 00:39:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> 12.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>> 12

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> 2 women.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.902 align:middle line:84%
>> And to the best
of your knowledge,

00:39:49.902 --> 00:39:51.390 align:middle line:84%
that was an official
OSI document.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:54.960 align:middle line:90%
And the headquarters number.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:90%
it was numbered.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Document was-- headquarters.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It was the after-action
report for it.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.910 align:middle line:84%
They had an initial report
that was dated in 1965.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.020 align:middle line:90%
That was preparation report.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.650 align:middle line:84%
It was counterintelligence
operation.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And then the 1980
report was a debrief

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:17.710 align:middle line:90%
and an after-action report.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.080 align:middle line:84%
They came back in
'77, but by the time

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.080 align:middle line:84%
they interviewed everybody,
got all their facts,

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.710 align:middle line:90%
the report is numbered in 1980.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.970 align:middle line:84%
The first two numbers
of the report is a year.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It's 80, headquarters,
D, 839- I think--

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:90%
2.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
number of the report.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did they
return in 1977?

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Where was that meeting spot?

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, they
came back to Tonopah,

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.390 align:middle line:90%
place called a Wellington.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:51.060 align:middle line:84%
It's an old mining camp on
Tonopah, on a test range.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.280 align:middle line:90%
They have a very secretive--

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.510 align:middle line:84%
it's naturally enclosed
like a coliseum

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.550 align:middle line:90%
and they landed inside that.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:03.225 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they had safeguards
for satellites and so forth.

00:41:03.225 --> 00:41:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
they landed in 1977.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So in your mind, would you
say Project Serpo was a 100%

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.330 align:middle line:90%
legitimate program?

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.355 align:middle line:90%
>> I wouldn't say 100%.

00:41:14.355 --> 00:41:16.860 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, it was probably--

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:21.000 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, 80%.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.280 align:middle line:84%
There's still some questions
about the numbers that weren't.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though the official
report said there were 12,

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.100 align:middle line:84%
there were other people who were
associated with this that have

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.670 align:middle line:90%
since died, but said no, no.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:34.590 align:middle line:90%
We only sent three.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:38.120 align:middle line:90%


00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.858 align:middle line:90%
And there's some other--

00:41:39.858 --> 00:41:41.400 align:middle line:84%
some of the equipment
that was taken.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.740 align:middle line:84%
There was conjecture
about, no, no, no, no.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:44.700 align:middle line:90%
We didn't take that.

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.990 align:middle line:90%
We took this.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And in the official report,
they took atomic demolition

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.080 align:middle line:84%
munitions with them--
a small atom bomb.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.305 align:middle line:90%
It was just a 1 kiloton.

00:41:56.305 --> 00:41:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But they took-- well,
the other guy said, no.

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.580 align:middle line:84%
We didn't take any
atom bombs with us.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:01.380 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a little
bit of back and forth.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, a little
back and forth.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But overall, I think, we
had an exchange program.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.700 align:middle line:90%
How many went?

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:11.660 align:middle line:90%
How many came back?

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Rick, what a stellar story.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And what an amazing
amount of intelligence

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.230 align:middle line:84%
you just offered us
and the audience.

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
for coming on the show.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
