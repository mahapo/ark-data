00:00:14.854 --> 00:00:16.520 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All
right, welcome back

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.540 align:middle line:10%
to Cosmic Disclosure.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:90%
And I'm here with David Adair.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we start
from the beginning?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.387 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a very
significant story here.

00:00:25.387 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Yeah.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.678 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Take us
through the story.

00:00:27.678 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: Well, a chain
of events occurred

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:10%
while this was going on.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:90%
My mother was a nurse--

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
this is 1966-- and she was in
charge of a coronary care unit.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And my mother ran third shift
from 11 to 7:00 in the morning.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And she had this elderly
patient, 95 years old,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:90%
and his name is Irving.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And the wife,
Arizona, was there.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And they had a son
named Curtis that

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:84%
would come in about 3 o'clock
in the morning to see him.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Their last name is LeMay.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is Curtis
LeMay's parents.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: My mother
was the CC technician.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And since she is in
charge of third shift,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Curtis LeMay has to go through
my mother to see his parents.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:90%
So they became friends.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And he would show up
at 3:00 in the morning,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:84%
because he's like paparazzi,
back in those years, I mean.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, former head
of the joint chiefs,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.191 align:middle line:84%
designer of the B-52, founder
of SAC, Strategic Air Command.

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Guy had a little bit of power.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So he got to know my
mother, and they'd just talk.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:90%
You know, personable guy.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And he asked my mother
what's your family like?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, I got my
husband and three sons.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And then she goes, these other
two sons are only about a year

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.070 align:middle line:90%
apart.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty much normal.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But she goes, that younger one,
he's a little bit different.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.285 align:middle line:90%
And Curtis says, how so?

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:10%
He's flying all these rockets
out in the cattle fields.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:10%
And they are really
fast, and they're big.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, how tall?

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, oh, they're
about twice my height.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:90%
He goes, damn, that's big.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And he's always
writing stuff down.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:90%
And that got Curtis's attention.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:84%
He goes, he had stuff
written in a book?

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.219 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he's got this big
notebook, about 93 pages of it.

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Could you bring that and
let me see it one night?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:90%
So she brought it one night.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.754 align:middle line:84%
I go to bed to get
up to go to school,

00:02:27.754 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
so I didn't even
know it was gone.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:84%
She comes back 7:00 in the
morning, put it back down,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I never even knew
it was missing.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh wow.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: So Curtis looks at it.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:90%
He starts flipping through it.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And he's a pretty
smart guy himself.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:90%
And he's going, man.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:84%
He turned around to
my mother, and said,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:90%
you don't have a copier do you?

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:90%
And he copied about a third.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Thank god he didn't
copy the whole thing.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But he copied about
a third of it.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And he took it to about an
hour and a half away from home,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:90%
to Battelle Memorial.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:90%
That's a big think tank.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was in the
books that caught his eye?

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Were you just taking notes
from these 1,800 books

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:90%
in the library that you'd read?

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: No, to do what
I was wanting to do,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to make everything
new from scratch.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So I extrapolated
information as a base point,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and then I started my own math.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And I went into electromagnetic
fusion containment.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: For space travel?

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, for
containment of a sun,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic fields.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So Curtis took those pages he
copied to Battelle Memorial,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and he asked them is
that just chicken scratch

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.330 align:middle line:90%
or something important?

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And their immediate
reaction was who is this?

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Where is this person
that's writing?

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, some kid launching
rockets out in cow fields.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And they go, my god.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:90%
So LeMay asked is it real?

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:84%
They said, yeah, we'd
like to meet him.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's when things
started with LeMay.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So LeMay and
his people started

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to think that you might actually
have developed a way to contain

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic fusion.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Now was that not being
done at the time?

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.525 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
payoff if that works?

00:04:11.525 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: There were
some people working

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle line:90%
on some stuff, Los Alamos.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.129 align:middle line:84%
But what LeMay saw was
that, according to Battelle,

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I was on the right track,
and I was definitely

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:90%
closing in on it.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And they just were
kind of flabbergasted

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't at some
institution or agency,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:90%
working with whatever.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And to LeMay, his brain was
going in something else.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So what he smelt was a coup
here that he could pull,

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and that is he would
fund me for everything

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I need, and he would
end up with something

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.400 align:middle line:84%
that he was dearly looking
for, which was speed.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
He was looking for
enormous speed.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Because he had a term that
I've never heard before in '71,

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:90%
it's called first strike.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So I just thought,
well, you're a kid.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:84%
You're 15 years
old, and somebody

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
is willing to give you
everything that you need?

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Come on, you going
to jump on it.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to say
no, I don't think so.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And there's
been some critics

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
that says, you
couldn't pull this off

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:90%
in a garage by yourself.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:90%
I needed everybody.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And this guy, with his
power and his background--

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:84%
although he was a civilian, it
does not matter in his power--

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:84%
he had the entire
iron triad working

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
for him, which is
the commercial,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and the military-industrial
complex.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So we had people
working with us.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:84%
We'd sub parts out that we
need, and machine definetely.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So I had people like National
Livermore Laboratories

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
at Los Alamos, Oak Ridge,
Tennessee, Battelle Memorial,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:90%
list just goes on and on.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:90%
And LeMay was very shrewd.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:84%
We would break things
up into small units,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and send them out,
farm them out.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.576 align:middle line:84%
So when the person's working
on the device for us,

00:06:11.576 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:90%
not really sure what it is.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
It might be some kind
of propulsion thing,

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.350 align:middle line:84%
or this might be
regulating a flow.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.145 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't put it together
unless you had all the parts.

00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And that was very smart of him.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So when everything came back to
our building, our assembly lab,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:90%
I put everything together.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
lot of personnel,

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:84%
among hundreds of
people working.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So it took us 26
and a half months.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I'd go to school, get off
the bus in the afternoon,

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and all these people were at
this big garage lab that I had.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And I had asked LeMay
to get everybody out

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.165 align:middle line:84%
of their uniforms, and wear
blue jeans and plaid shirts,

00:06:53.165 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
so they blend in
with the locals.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm trying to
live a normal life here.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh man, that's
perfect, it's like covert.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:90%
And I went, what's covert?

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
He's, never mind,
just keep on going.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And I tried not to talk
about much at school.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.035 align:middle line:84%
But the kids knew that there
was something going on with me.

00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what
did LeMay tell you

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.560 align:middle line:84%
the goal was of what
you were doing for him?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.302 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: What he wanted was--

00:07:21.302 --> 00:07:23.260 align:middle line:84%
he said, I want the same
thing you want, David.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.717 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, you want
an electromagnetic fusion

00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:27.675 align:middle line:90%
containment fire plant?

00:07:27.675 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, yeah,
that's what I want.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's see what
we can do to get it.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And he knew for me
to test my field--

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.090 align:middle line:84%
the best thing to test it
in is a rocket body, which

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what he wanted.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.250 align:middle line:10%
So Colonel Arthur
Bailey Williams

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:10%
was the XO General LeMay.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And he was he was there
on site every day.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I never saw LeMay,
it was just Colonel Williams.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And once we got
done, we were ready.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.544 align:middle line:84%
It was completed
after 26 months.

00:08:03.544 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And now we're ready
to put it in a truck

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and take it to Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:90%
And so we arrived there.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:10%
I do remember this,
when we pulled in,

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.697 align:middle line:10%
there was a C-141 Starlifter.

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:18.655 align:middle line:10%
If you've ever seen them
things, they are huge.

00:08:18.655 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Enormous.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: And there was this
ring of heavily armed Air Force

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:10%
people around the plane.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.122 align:middle line:84%
And they told me to
drive over to it.

00:08:29.122 --> 00:08:30.538 align:middle line:84%
And I was afraid
to pull up to it,

00:08:30.538 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:84%
because I thought
something's going on,

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to mess up with it.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
that was for me.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:84%
That was for my-- and I
remember just standing there

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
on this apron, big concrete
area, and that big C-141

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:90%
sitting there.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And all these military people
with weapons, and a lot

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.900 align:middle line:90%
of security people everywhere.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, my god,
this is all for me.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:90%
About to have a heart attack.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So we get the thing
rolled up onto the plane,

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and off to White Sands,
New Mexico we go.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
launch this thing.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And when we get
there, we prep it.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when
more characters started

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:90%
showing up in the story.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a long way to
explain it, but I

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:84%
had become friends with
Wernher von Braun by then.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Ah.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And people go,
well, how's that possible?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:90%
I won science awards.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh man, by the time I was
16, I had won probably

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.365 align:middle line:90%
over 100 scientific awards.

00:09:29.365 --> 00:09:30.225 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And some
of the trophies

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:90%
were taller than I was.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And you have dignitaries
hanging medals around your neck.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, one dignitary was Wernher
von Braun, which makes sense.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:52.605 align:middle line:84%
So now we're back at White
Sands with the rocket.

00:09:52.605 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did the C-141 actually
hold the rocket inside of it?

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is that why
they were guarding it?

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.550 align:middle line:90%
LeMay picked it out.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:90%
And I said, good choice.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So we got to White Sands,
and then there was--

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:90%
that's when things started.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:84%
This black DC-9
landed the next day.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And I made a joke with Colonel
Williams as he's watching DC-9.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:90%
And I notice he's not smiling.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.032 align:middle line:84%
I said, where's the
white bunny head?

00:10:20.032 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, on the side of
the tail of the plane.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
Huge Hefner's plane

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.694 align:middle line:90%
flying around those years.

00:10:24.694 --> 00:10:25.818 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The Playboy bunny?

00:10:25.818 --> 00:10:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up at
him, and normally, he's

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:90%
really a personable guy.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:90%
But he's not smiling.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:90%
He didn't look happy at all.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.450 align:middle line:90%
And he had a good reason.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Cause he was worried about
something, and he was right.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Soon as the plane rolled up
to our hangar, it stopped.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Out came these guys, so help
me, black suits, white shirts,

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.910 align:middle line:90%
little skinny black ties.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Get closer to them,
funny-looking triangle watch.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know--

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:52.635 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Triangle watch?

00:10:52.635 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yes kind of a
triangle-shaped watch.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.325 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So they're agents.

00:10:56.325 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Actually, what I
believe y'all call MiBs.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.276 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: MiBs, yeah.

00:11:00.276 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That's the first time--

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.456 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know who they were.

00:11:02.456 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
I just thought,
pretty stupid people

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:84%
wearing that kind of clothes
in the middle of a New Mexico

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.375 align:middle line:90%
desert in the summer.

00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:09.175 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:11:09.175 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And then one little
guy came out behind them

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.950 align:middle line:90%
after everybody got off.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Now he had khaki
shorts and stuff.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.760 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, he's smart.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:90%
He knows how to dress.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
Colonel Williams,

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:90%
and he's not saying a word.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, what's
wrong, Colonel Williams?

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.505 align:middle line:84%
He goes, we're in
serious trouble.

00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:30.125 align:middle line:84%
He goes, well, who's
the guy in khaki?

00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And then he got closer, and
I recognized him from a photo

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.330 align:middle line:90%
that von Braun showed me.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.190 align:middle line:84%
He came in through
Operation Paperclip.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.700 align:middle line:84%
His name is Rudolph,
Arthur Rudolph.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:84%
He is the chief architect of
the F-1 Saturn V moon rocket

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:90%
engines of Apollo.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:84%
But he's also a full Gestapo
Nazi, and he had killed--

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:59.275 align:middle line:84%
he was responsible for
tens of thousands of deaths

00:11:59.275 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:84%
at Mittelwerk, [INAUDIBLE] where
they had built the V-2 rockets.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And von Braun told
me if he'd ever

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:84%
show up in anything I'm doing,
you are in such trouble.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Because this guy
will take command.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.377 align:middle line:90%
So at least I knew who he was.

00:12:13.377 --> 00:12:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell Colonel
Williams knew who he was,

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:90%
and the Colonel wasn't happy.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:90%
So he come walking over to me.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And I went, hi, my name's
David, what's your name?

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't answer.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh he said, oh, I'm just
a guy goes around looking

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.320 align:middle line:90%
at hardware for the military.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.765 align:middle line:84%
I understand you got a
different kind of rockets here.

00:12:34.765 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, you
want to see it?

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:90%
And he says, sure.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So I take him over
to it, and he gets

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:90%
on the opposite side of me.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.852 align:middle line:90%
The rocket's between us.

00:12:42.852 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said, can you open
it up and let me see?

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:45.610 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So I take a big block
of metal in my hand,

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and run it down the hull.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.394 align:middle line:84%
And the panel lifts
up and slides over.

00:12:53.394 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking at my hand
and that block of metal,

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:90%
and he goes, what is that?

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.854 align:middle line:84%
And I go, it's well, called
a dissimilar metal lock.

00:13:00.854 --> 00:13:04.095 align:middle line:84%
I went, it's old, it's
World War II technology.

00:13:04.095 --> 00:13:05.790 align:middle line:90%
You don't have one of these?

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:90%
He got mad on that one.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, I may
have insulted him.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.667 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, he didn't
know anything about it.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's pretty advanced.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, it's old
stuff, it's not advanced.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.284 align:middle line:84%
So he sticks his head
down into the engine area.

00:13:20.284 --> 00:13:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
would be a good time

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:90%
to say something to him.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So I lean over, and I
was saying to his ear

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:84%
while he was looking
down, I said,

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:38.470 align:middle line:84%
this engine has about a million
times the power of the F-1

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Saturn V moon rocket
engines, Doctor Rudolph.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Man, he--

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.198 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Which he made.

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh man.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:84%
He raised up--
and I'd never seen

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.230 align:middle line:90%
anybody get that red before.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he looked
like a barber pole.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me,
and goes, who are you?

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And I go, I'm just
a kid that launches

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:84%
rockets in cow fields
over here in Ohio.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And then things just
went south from there.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:90%
He took over completely.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:90%
He took over the launch.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
He had me reprogram the
off-the-shelf navigation

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.160 align:middle line:84%
to an area about 456
miles, if I remember right,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:90%
northwest of us.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he dropped it in a
place called Groom Lake, Nevada.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And I guess y'all call
it today, Area 51.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I never heard
of Area 51 in 1971.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.277 align:middle line:90%
Just Groom Lake's all I knew.

00:14:32.277 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what happened
when you got it to Groom Lake?

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, once it
got out of White Sands

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and it launched, I was
curious about Groom Lake.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:90%
So I pulled geophysical maps.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And it says it's just
a big dry lake bed.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you see
this black DC-9's

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:84%
got rubber tires, [INAUDIBLE] up
to its belly in this dry lake.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.457 align:middle line:84%
He tells me, shut up
and get on the plane.

00:14:58.457 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's got a good reason,
because when we get there,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.545 align:middle line:90%
it's big runways.

00:15:02.545 --> 00:15:03.930 align:middle line:90%
It's an Air Force Base.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not on my maps.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, we kind of circled
the base at first.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.677 align:middle line:84%
And we saw Pitholem laying
out on the desert floor.

00:15:10.677 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And that's your rocket.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.372 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Exactly
where they wanted it.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the only compliment I
think I ever got from Rudolph.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, you landed
it precisely on mark.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, yeah, well good.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The rocket could land?

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: On the
sides of the rocket,

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I built these big
slip-slide containers

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:90%
that have parachutes.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.060 align:middle line:84%
These two parachutes came
out, and these parachutes

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:84%
are tank parachutes,
70-ton tank?

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So the rocket
landed just like a feather.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:90%
There's no damage, it's perfect.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Just laying on the desert floor,
parachutes blowing around it.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, we land,
we taxi over to it.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:84%
There were three
hangars, I remember.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
construction going on.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.940 align:middle line:90%
This is June 20th, 1971.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's construction
all over this base, runways,

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So we go to the center hangar,
and I thought, man, this

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:90%
is really strange.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.485 align:middle line:84%
None of this is on my maps,
and these are government maps.

00:16:10.485 --> 00:16:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I thought, what
the hell is this?

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, we get off.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:84%
We get in these funny-looking
go-cart things, big ones,

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
really big, carrying
like 10, 12 people.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And being in science, and
oriented in engineering,

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at these
golf carts, and I go,

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
what the hell is
running these things?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not propane tanks.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not electric.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:84%
It's got a big intake, that
some kind of light recessed

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
inside gets brighter
when it runs.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Then when it slows down,
the light dims down.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did it
have any exhaust?

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And it only made
a strange whine.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Kind of like a
spooling effect, like a turbine.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what--

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and even today, I have no idea
what those things were about.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.540 align:middle line:90%
But they were fast.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, golf carts only go
like, 10-15 miles an hour.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.890 align:middle line:84%
These things did 60
or 70 miles an hour.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:84%
So he says, get on
this thing, and I did.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And we rode into
the center hangar.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And we stopped, and
we're setting there.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And then these
yellow caution lights

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.842 align:middle line:90%
start flashing at all the doors.

00:17:20.842 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Then out of the floor,
comes these little pipes

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:90%
with chains hooked to each part.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.569 align:middle line:90%
So a guardrail's coming up.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, what is that for?

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't want people
walking in this building.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, we got the
answer pretty quick.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:39.170 align:middle line:84%
The floor of this hangar
is bigger than a gymnasium.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.410 align:middle line:90%
The entire floor goes down.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.132 align:middle line:90%
It's an elevator.

00:17:43.132 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, man,
that big elevator,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and with a concrete
floor like that, there's

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:84%
got to be 100 tons
of concrete here.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, man, you can't
be using chains or cable

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.540 align:middle line:90%
moving something this heavy.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Sure enough, weren't.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.205 align:middle line:84%
After we got down
below the floor,

00:18:02.205 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:84%
you can see them spin about 12
of them, spinning in the walls.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:90%
They're worm gears.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:84%
That's the heaviest load-bearing
gear we ever know of.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Each one was bigger
than a sequoia tree.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I thought
about that, I thought,

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.690 align:middle line:84%
where'd they cast and
manufacture those things at?

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:90%
Just amazing.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:90%
We went down, and I was so--

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.985 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So it could hold a
spectacular amount of weight.

00:18:26.985 --> 00:18:28.224 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:18:28.224 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could drag an
aircraft carrier in there,

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:90%
and drop this thing.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So whatever they're
moving is really heavy.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So we drop down, we go
down, and I'm counting feet,

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and estimate we're
about 200 feet down.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:90%
And we flush out with the floor.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:51.314 align:middle line:84%
And man, what you
see next is nuts.

00:18:51.314 --> 00:18:53.260 align:middle line:90%
You're looking straight forward.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:90%
The other three walls are solid.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:90%
So you're looking one way only.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.269 align:middle line:90%
You're looking at this--

00:18:59.269 --> 00:19:01.560 align:middle line:84%
it's like Mammoth Cave, if
you ever been in that thing.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, I have been.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:90%
In Kentucky.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah,
that cavern thing?

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah, it's huge.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.809 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's like
that, but this is

00:19:06.809 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:90%
about 10 times the size of it.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It goes down,
I guess, from the floor

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the arc
is probably 100 feet.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes
down to the sides,

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and goes straight
down, canters down,

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and then it's
perpendicular walls.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
In these walls are all these
shops, and hangar bays,

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.020 align:middle line:90%
and offices.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And you see people
working in the office.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're just getting
it on this go-cart thing.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And we go past all these hangar
doors every once in a while.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And some of the hangar
doors are open partially.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And man, I saw some things in
there I just can't explain.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:84%
There was some
really unusual craft.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell if they were
aircraft or spacecrafts.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Went on down further, and
there was another thing over

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:84%
in the hangar, and it was
open a little bit wider.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Man, this thing was a
moose of an aircraft.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:09.400 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a
XB-70, the Valkyrie.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:84%
But it had some different
canards and different air

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:90%
intakes.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:90%
So it's something else.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Now the first Valkyrie
was destroyed in a crash.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
It sucked up a camera
plane in its tail.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:84%
The second one was in
a museum, the Air Force

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:90%
museum at Wright-Patterson.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.055 align:middle line:84%
So what was this
thing setting here?

00:20:33.055 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And once again, it had
all kinds of things hooked up

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.505 align:middle line:90%
to it, and drip pans.

00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Now this thing's running.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it's doing.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.650 align:middle line:90%
So we went on down.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Went on down about
a quarter of a mile.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And this causeway,
the main corridor, it

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.580 align:middle line:84%
went clear out of sight as
far the human eye could see.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And it would curve with
the curvature of the earth.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I mean,
it's just enormous.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're riding,
and I just asked

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:90%
the guy a very simple question.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what did y'all
do with all the dirt?

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.186 align:middle line:90%
And they got so mad about that.

00:21:14.186 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why would a
question about dirt bother him?

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And I just made
another off comment.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I said, what did
you use, a phaser?

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:90%
And they got really mad then.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I thought, stepping
on nerves here.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what is
going on with this place?

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How fast do
you think this golf

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:90%
cart was going right now?

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Doing about 50.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So we're
covering a lot of area.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And you still don't see
the end of this thing.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: But here's
where it gets good.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Now that I'm kind of
calming down from--

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know there was
anything underground.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I was leaning out,
just to look around

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.930 align:middle line:84%
the people sitting in front of
me so I look further, right?

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed when
I stuck out my arm,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:90%
there's no shadows anywhere.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.872 align:middle line:90%
Like a paint booth.

00:21:59.872 --> 00:22:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Can't have a shadow, because
you'll get a run in the paint.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:03.750 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:90%
But here's the problem.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:90%
I can't find any light fixtures.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.700 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:84%
No indirect lighting, no
direct light, just no lighting

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:90%
fixtures.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.285 align:middle line:84%
Perfectly illuminated, and I
have no idea even today how

00:22:17.285 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:90%
in God's name did you do that?

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
I have thought that it
might be atmosphere.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:84%
But how do you
illuminate an atmosphere?

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.220 align:middle line:90%
You're breathing your own light?

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did it look any
brighter near the ceiling?

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just
evenly illuminated?

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Evenly
illuminated, perfect.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:36.104 align:middle line:84%
Illumination right down in the
corners, which you'll have--

00:22:36.104 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Very strange.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah,
that's a word for it.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now you're
driving down this hall,

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and the whole
entire time, you're

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:90%
going at 50 miles an hour.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.315 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You're just seeing
offices, offices, offices?

00:22:47.315 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And hangar
doors with craft in them,

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.885 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of stuff?

00:22:50.885 --> 00:22:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:52.723 align:middle line:90%
And some doors are--

00:22:52.723 --> 00:22:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there must have
been hundreds or maybe even

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:90%
thousands of them.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Maybe, if we
didn't keep on driving.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.145 align:middle line:84%
Like, we only went
like, a quarter mile.

00:22:59.145 --> 00:23:00.105 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:23:00.105 --> 00:23:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: But it gets stranger.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
If things aren't weird
enough, no shadows, perfect

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
illumination, gigantic
cavern I didn't even know

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.980 align:middle line:84%
was there, all
these hangar bays--

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and most of them
were closed tight.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So god knows what
was behind them.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.194 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:23:21.194 --> 00:23:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And how bizarre it is that
you're asking simple questions,

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:90%
and they're getting all angry.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, and
I mean really angry.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I was about to say to
them, calm down, gee, god,

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm just asking.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:34.383 align:middle line:90%
And we come up--

00:23:34.383 --> 00:23:37.370 align:middle line:84%
if it's not strange
enough, imagine this.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.590 align:middle line:84%
We pull up on the
left hand side.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:84%
There's this iris,
like a camera.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: About 40
feet in diameter.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That is huge, y'all.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:84%
We stop, driver gets out,
runs over to this glass panel,

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:90%
puts his hand down.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And he looks in
this scope thing,

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:90%
and then there's a flash.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:90%
And the iris opens up.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And when iris opens completely,
another from horizontal panel

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:84%
comes by to fill in the gap
so we can drive across it.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this was like
a retinal scan that he had?

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I was
sitting there going,

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:84%
is that a retinal scanner
and a palm scanner?

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.050 align:middle line:84%
We don't have
anything like that.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle line:90%
This is 1971.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't have no PCs, no faxes,
no modems, no cell phones,

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.810 align:middle line:90%
no laptops.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.312 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have a
handheld calculator

00:24:33.312 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:90%
from Texas Instruments.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:90%
That's a few years off.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:36.292 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:24:36.292 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And you're
telling me this guy's

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:84%
got a retina scanner
and a a palm scanner

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.460 align:middle line:84%
on a wall that opens
this giant iris door?

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Which I ain't never
seen an iris that big.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going man, what's
going on with this place?

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:84%
They're packing technology
like I've never seen.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we go into this
big gymnasium-sized room,

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.399 align:middle line:90%
and it's dark.

00:24:58.399 --> 00:24:59.315 align:middle line:90%
Here comes the lights.

00:24:59.315 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let me just ask
one question, though.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that iris might
be that they would have that

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:84%
instead of a regular door, in
case something inside exploded,

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and they needed to contain
an explosive force?

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Well, that or security.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They surely didn't
want you just walking in there,

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:90%
slide a door open, and walk in.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:90%
You ain't sliding an iris open.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.166 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right, that's true.

00:25:21.166 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So whatever--
first impression I got--

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.819 align:middle line:84%
man, there's something really
super-duper behind this door.

00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to have
anybody just walking in seeing.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So we drive in,
and the lights come up.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:84%
I thought, all right, I'm
going to find a light fixture.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking everywhere,
no light fixtures.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Comes on like a rheostat.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Comes all the way
to full luminosity

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.830 align:middle line:84%
to match what's out
in the causeway.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, god,
how do they do that?

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd give anything to
know how you do that.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So we pull up to a
stop, and at the far end

00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:03.670 align:middle line:84%
of the room, this big giant
steel platform, like a stage.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
something up on the stage,

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.020 align:middle line:84%
but there's this giant curtain
hanging down around it,

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:84%
which is not a material
curtain, like cloth.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:18.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like mudflaps off a semi,
but as big as this curtain is,

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.789 align:middle line:90%
it weighed tons.

00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You're saying
giant, but could you

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:84%
be a little more specific about
the platform and the curtain?

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, I would
say just the curtain

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.565 align:middle line:90%
itself was over 100 feet wide.

00:26:28.565 --> 00:26:29.365 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:26:29.365 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And it stood
probably 25 feet tall.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That's big.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So something
big is behind there.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:37.871 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: You better believe it.

00:26:37.871 --> 00:26:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's cables that
runs up to the ceiling,

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.052 align:middle line:84%
and they just disappear
into darkness.

00:26:43.052 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:90%
God knows what's up in there.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want to
know at this point.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they
raise the curtain.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:84%
We get out of the cart,
we're all standing there.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:58.330 align:middle line:84%
They raise the curtain,
and I was so disappointed.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.060 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
ahead of everybody,

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.850 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic fusion
containment engine

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.911 align:middle line:84%
setting up on the
desert floor, right?

00:27:04.911 --> 00:27:10.220 align:middle line:84%
This curtain rises-- think of an
18-wheel semi with big sleeper

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.510 align:middle line:90%
cab.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:90%
That's about 70 feet wide.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.115 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:27:15.115 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Or long.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.326 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: 70 feet long.

00:27:17.326 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: About 70 feet long,
25 feet wide, 15 feet tall.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:84%
It's an electromagnetic fusion
containment engine that big.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I'm
setting there, going--

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:90%
I had mixed emotions.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I was disappointed, but
I was just thrilled.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, good god, mine is only
about 2 and 1/2 feet long,

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and this thing is
just a monster.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let me ask
you a question then.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that when LeMay saw
the original 93-page notebook

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:84%
that your mother showed him,
that he was seeing blueprints

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.520 align:middle line:84%
that you were making that
looked similar to this very

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.395 align:middle line:84%
valuable object that
they had in Area 51?

00:27:57.395 --> 00:27:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I think Battelle did.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You, know Battelle
Memorial, in 1971, they

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.060 align:middle line:84%
had 137 Nobel
laureates on staff.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.645 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It's a powerhouse.

00:28:07.645 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, a group of them figured
it out, looking at the math.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And they can tell by the
math which direction or shape

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.680 align:middle line:90%
you're taking in physical form.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I would imagine
that somebody in that group

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.160 align:middle line:84%
knew about this thing,
or made LeMay know of it.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.110 align:middle line:84%
But to be humble, I was
very humbled at the moment.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I had a Model A,
and they had a Lamborghini.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And even though the
Model A and the Lamborghini

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:84%
are so different in
powers, both of them

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.450 align:middle line:84%
are internal
combustion engines, OK?

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.385 align:middle line:90%
They got some similarities.

00:28:50.385 --> 00:28:51.737 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Was there a color?

00:28:51.737 --> 00:28:53.070 align:middle line:90%
What color would you say it was?

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It had an aqua
color, like ocean blue-green.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Really pretty.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:90%
And it had a sheen to it.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:07.130 align:middle line:84%
But unlike mine, this big one
had an ectoskeleton structure

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.490 align:middle line:90%
over it.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Which I thought,
that is so weird.

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.230 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And it looked very
much similar--

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.785 align:middle line:90%
it looked like HR Giger's work.

00:29:16.785 --> 00:29:17.585 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:29:17.585 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.660 align:middle line:90%
And I though, man, what is this?

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, I had to ask.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Looked at Rudolph, is this thing
a machine or is it organic?

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- Because the
ectoskeleton structure looked

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:30.370 align:middle line:90%
like bone.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I'm setting there
going, man, all I can say,

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.160 align:middle line:90%
that's alien-looking.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.450 align:middle line:84%
If you say it looked like bone,
and it was an exoskeleton,

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.060 align:middle line:84%
would it be something
that had a regular matrix

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.350 align:middle line:90%
structure, like chicken wire?

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Or did it have
certain areas that

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.260 align:middle line:84%
were thicker, certain
areas that were thinner?

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:90%
Were there dendrites?

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.661 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, you know
how bones start off

00:29:48.661 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:84%
thicker at the spinal
column, like a breath cage.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And it's breath
caging all around.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.900 align:middle line:90%
It's really protected well.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.900 align:middle line:90%


00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And there was steps
leading up to the platform

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:02.850 align:middle line:90%
where it's setting.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:03.724 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: In the bone?

00:30:03.724 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: No, we're
back at the platform.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, OK.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I turn around and ask
Rudolph, can I go up the stairs

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and onto the platform and
get close to this thing?

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Air Force people say no.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Rudolph says yes.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And he's obviously in charge,
because they just got quiet.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So I went up the steps,
walked up to this thing.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the weird
stuff really started.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.310 align:middle line:84%
You think weird now, it's
going to get more weird.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.240 align:middle line:84%
First thing I noticed,
my shadow's on it.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I've been seeing
through the whole thing,

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.170 align:middle line:90%
there's no shadows anywhere.

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: No shadows.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.786 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So I'm spinning
around, looking everywhere,

00:30:37.786 --> 00:30:41.420 align:middle line:90%
and I see no light fixtures.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, we got luminosity with no
light fixtures and no shadows.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Now we got a thing sitting here
that's got my shadow on it.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:90%
Of course, normal down here.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.430 align:middle line:90%
And I notice something else.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
As big as it is, on my
device, I had probably

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:03.270 align:middle line:84%
five miles of wiring, screws
nuts, bolts, well-aligned seams

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:04.950 align:middle line:90%
and all this stuff.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:06.540 align:middle line:84%
This dang thing,
as big as it was,

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:84%
not one screw, rivet,
weld line, seam.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it
grew, like an eggplant.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.570 align:middle line:90%
And I went--

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I was just dying to turn around
and say to him, how the hell'd

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:19.769 align:middle line:90%
you build this thing?

00:31:19.769 --> 00:31:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And I figured I already
got enough trouble asking

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:22.680 align:middle line:90%
about dirt.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.450 align:middle line:84%
They'd really go
nuts on that one.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If you say it's
aqua blue, did it have--

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.820 align:middle line:84%
in terms of its
specularity, was it glossy?

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Was it flat?

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.197 align:middle line:84%
Did it have a kind
of an aluminum look?

00:31:33.197 --> 00:31:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Was there particles in it?

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Different areas-- the
bone ectoskeleton structure,

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.170 align:middle line:90%
that was flat.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:48.520 align:middle line:84%
The big round spheres, which in
my engine would be cyclotrons,

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.390 align:middle line:84%
they were like the aqua
color, but they were smooth.

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I walked up to it,
I noticed my shadow, right?

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I go like this,
my shadow is just

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:90%
a split second behind me.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.750 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going--

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's weird.

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I was just--

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm watching it, and I turned
around and looked at Rudolph,

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.970 align:middle line:90%
and he was happy.

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:10.770 align:middle line:90%
I could tell.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:14.086 align:middle line:84%
Like, uh-huh, you're getting on
and picking this up, are you?

00:32:14.086 --> 00:32:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And I look at him, and he and
I are the only one really eye

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:17.610 align:middle line:90%
connecting.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Military people are
like, different world.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:26.565 align:middle line:84%
So I just went, is this
heat recognition alloy?

00:32:26.565 --> 00:32:29.260 align:middle line:84%
It's picking up the heat
radiation off of me,

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.855 align:middle line:84%
and then reflecting
it on the hull.

00:32:30.855 --> 00:32:33.054 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, god,
that's pretty cool.

00:32:33.054 --> 00:32:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I hate
to stop you right there,

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.440 align:middle line:90%
but we have to make episodes.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's all the time
we have for this episode.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.370 align:middle line:90%
It's very fascinating.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Sorry for the cliffhanger.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
be back with more

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.370 align:middle line:84%
with David Adair,
our special guest

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.020 align:middle line:90%
here on Cosmic Disclosure.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm David Wilcock, and I want
to thank you for watching.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:56.834 align:middle line:90%
