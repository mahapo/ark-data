EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.760 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.645 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Today we are discussing the
search for an escape hybrid.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.963 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:34.963 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:84%
RICHARD C. DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: So what can you tell us
about Operation Radiant Springs?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.100 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Operation Radiant Springs
involved a massive search

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.980 align:middle line:84%
on the East Coast, right
around the Washington, DC area,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:84%
for a particular hybrid that
had been involved in an incident

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:90%
some time earlier.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:84%
The incident involved the
harming of some humans.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And the US intelligence agencies
knew that this particular hybrid

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.430 align:middle line:84%
had been involved, but
it escaped the custody

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:84%
of a civilian law enforcement
agency, the Washington

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:90%
Metropolitan Police Department.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:84%
They had originally
detained this hybrid

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:90%
under the name of Charles Dull.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: Did they know
that at the time

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:90%
the regular civilian police?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: No, they had no idea.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:84%
But there was an
attempt to locate out

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.010 align:middle line:84%
for this person, the
description of the person,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't listed in the
NCIC, or the National Crime

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Information Center
system as a hybrid.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:90%
It was just--

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: A name.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: --with a description.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Metropolitan Police
had detained and then

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:90%
let the hybrid go.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: Why did they detain
him in the first place?

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: He was involved
in a traffic dispute

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
on the streets of
Massachusetts Avenue

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and the streets of Washington,
DC, with another motorist.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And somebody had
called the police

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and they responded and they
detained both motorists

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.250 align:middle line:84%
investigating what
was occurring.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And they had detained him
for, I think, close to an hour

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
because they transported
him from the scene

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:84%
to a local police precinct
with the other driver.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And so he was detained for
a short period of time,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
but not enough time
for US intelligence

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go
and pick him up.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that hybrid
could be dangerous

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, a
massive search occurred

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.445 align:middle line:90%
within the Washington, DC area.

00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: Around what
time was this?

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:90%
What year was it?

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And also for the audience,
are we talking about what

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.090 align:middle line:90%
did the hybrid look like?

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: It in the early 1980s,
the hybrid looked like a human

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:84%
being, but it had
hybrid characteristics.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.830 align:middle line:84%
At that time, we knew
some things about hybrids.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.400 align:middle line:84%
We knew that they had traits
within their blood, their bile,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and I think their ear
canals that were different.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you walked up
to one, you wouldn't

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
detect it to be a hybrid
or an extraterrestrial.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
A hybrid is part human
and part extraterrestrial.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:90%
That's part of a hybrid.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And so, nobody would detect it,
unless you had the detection

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
training and/or was able to
analyze the blood and other body

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:90%
fluids of it.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So, the civilian law enforcement
agency didn't have any way

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
of knowing who this
particular hybrid was,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
but he was carrying an ID
with a name of Charles Dull,

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.335 align:middle line:84%
D-U-LL and with a date
of birth in 1940s.

00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: What do we know about
this hybrid and its origins?

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:10%
DOTY: Well, we knew that
the hybrid was involved

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:10%
with this other
particular species,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.490 align:middle line:10%
and this hybrid facilitated
the entry of this other species

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:10%
into a particular location
on Bolling Air Force base

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:10%
that allowed the species
to go in and cause

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:10%
some harm to humans.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.808 align:middle line:90%
We knew that.

00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: What kind of species
are we talking about?

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.892 align:middle line:90%
Who are you referring to?

00:04:12.892 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: We're talking
about the Quataloids.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: The Quataloids.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:84%
These are the aggressive ones we
talked about in prior episodes.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: Yes, very aggressive.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:84%
They were responsible
for harming humans

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
at Bolling Air Force Base
several months earlier.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And this hybrid because the
hybrid looked like a human being

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:84%
was actually aligned
with the Quataloids.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we actually
fully understood that.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
But in order to understand
exactly how this hybrid was

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate getting these
Quataloids into Bolling Air

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Force base, I don't think
we fully understood that,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%
but it was able to.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And when the Quataloids entered
into this very secure facility,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:90%
they harmed some human beings.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:84%
The Quataloids, two of them
were neutralized to the others.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if whether
they had escaped,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:84%
but the hybrid we
fully identified

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
by pictures that were closed
circuit television camera that

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:84%
was in the facility took
a picture of this hybrid.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So we knew that this
was either a human

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:90%
or the suspected a hybrid.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they
suspected it to be a hybrid

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
was after they
analyzed the pictures

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that they had taken inside
this secure facility,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:84%
they saw the traits
that identified

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
this particular
hybrid as a hybrid.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: Rick, what was the
origin of this hybrid?

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.800 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, the time that
this happened, we didn't know.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:84%
But later on, we determined
that this hybrid had somehow

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.700 align:middle line:84%
formed an alliance
with the Quataloids

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:84%
sometime earlier, probably
maybe years earlier.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And were facilitating or
allowing the Quataloids

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:84%
to do things on Earth whereby
this hybrid was setting

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:90%
this up for the Quataloids.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, the hybrid was
not a Quataloid, OK?

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:84%
It was an actual
hybrid, probably

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:90%
part of the hostile Grey force.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know
for a fact that's

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:90%
what they found out later.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we later
captured this hybrid.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:84%
But leading up to
this, the hybrid

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
was just opening
doors, so to speak,

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:84%
to allow these Quataloids, who
were the insect looking type.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
They were genetically
engineered.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.150 align:middle line:10%
And if you saw them
out in the streets

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:10%
would easily identify
them as not human.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:10%
But the hybrid could
pass as a human

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:10%
and could open
doors, so to speak,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:10%
to bring these Quantaloids
in to do this harm that they

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.685 align:middle line:10%
did at Bolling Air Force base.

00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: Why were they trying to
get into Bolling Air Force base?

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:90%
What was their whole objective?

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Again, this is coming
from our analysis of it.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
We obviously can't get in the
mind of an extraterrestrials

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:84%
to really figure out
what they were doing.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
But we figured because the past
we had Quataloids in detention.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
We'd captured them,
we killed some.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And we think it was retribution
for us harming them.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And they hit-- we think the
Quataloids hit the control

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.860 align:middle line:84%
center of the United States,
which have been Washington,

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:84%
DC why they actually
picked Bolling Air Force

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
base during a meeting with a
lot of different high level

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:90%
military personnel.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:90%
We really don't know.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But that was their target
and that's what they hit.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: So, Rick, they
obviously got access

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.210 align:middle line:90%
into Bolling Air Force base.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little bit
what happened once they got in

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying to
accomplish some retribution?

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's dive into that.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.780 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, the
hybrid got him in.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: OK.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: And their target
was a secure facility,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
which was partially underground,
where a high level meeting was

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:84%
going to occur
with 06s colonels.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And I believe there was one
Naval officer there who was

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:84%
a captain, but he was 06, and
one Brigadier General was an 07.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And the Quataloid used
a form of-- because it

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.770 align:middle line:84%
was a secure facility, it used
a form of a tunneling system

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.190 align:middle line:84%
that they were able to
create to get inside.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And there were six
military officers in there

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and the Quataloids neutralized
or ended the life of those six

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:90%
military officers.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
There were several security
policemen involved in this,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and they fought back because
they were guarding the facility.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Two were severely injured,
but two managed to fight back

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:90%
and they weren't injured.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: All right.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So from what you
said, they went in,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:84%
they neutralized these higher
ups and now they left again.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Where does that bring us
back to from the hybrid?

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, from that
point on, the hybrid

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
got out of Bolling Air
Force base sometime later.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it
was just a few days.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
He was stopped inside
Washington, DC and Massachusetts

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Avenue because of
a traffic dispute,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.080 align:middle line:90%
which I talked about earlier.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And then unbeknownst to the
Metropolitan Police Department,

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.560 align:middle line:90%
they let him go.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
During this time period, US
Intelligence OSI and Air Force

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:84%
security forces looked at
the video cameras, the closed

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:90%
circuit--

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:57.250 align:middle line:84%
They call them back, then closed
circuit cameras of the facility,

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and they saw that this
one human was there.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And after analyzing the
pictures really close up,

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:10.020 align:middle line:84%
they realized that particular
human was a hybrid.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And now they wanted
to catch that hybrid.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And they set out a
description of the hybrid

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:84%
in the National Crime
Information Center system.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But the name that the
Metropolitan Police had

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:84%
wasn't corresponding with
what the government knew.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the Metropolitan
Police let him go.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: And what was implemented
to recapture this hybrid.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: A massive operation.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:84%
They used military
intelligence, US intelligence.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, the Central
Intelligence Agency

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a charter to operate
inside the United States.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:84%
The way around that is
using their own police force

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
because see, they had
your own police force

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and their own federal
officers, so to speak.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:90%
So they brought some of them in.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.260 align:middle line:84%
They utilized Air
Force OSI agents.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
The FBI was also brought
in, a special unit

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:84%
of the FBI and the
Secret Service.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And they figured
that this hybrid

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
was in and around the
Washington, DC area someplace.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So their job was to find
where it was housing.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:90%
And so they tapped phones.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:84%
They knew the type of
vehicle it was driving

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:84%
because the Metropolitan
Police had stopped that vehicle

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:90%
during that traffic dispute.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:90%
So they knew it was a--

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was a
1977 era vehicle.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:84%
They knew the license
plate in the vehicle.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, the license
plate comes back to the man that

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.700 align:middle line:84%
was on the driver's license
as Charles Dull, D-U-L-L.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So now they're looking
for this Charles Dull.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But they were rather
than putting it out

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.620 align:middle line:84%
to the press or the
television and radio services,

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
as this guy is a
hybrid, they listed him

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.178 align:middle line:90%
as a spy, a suspected spy.

00:12:11.178 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: It's a good cover.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: And they listed
him as Air Force

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Lieutenant that had escaped--

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.300 align:middle line:84%
or escaped, not necessarily
escaped from a prison,

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:84%
but escaped from
being prosecuted.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And they listed his
last name as Cook.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go back
in the history,

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find out
there was a Lieutenant Cook

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:84%
that the Air Force Office
of Special Investigation

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
was looking for who
was, in fact, a spy.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that's kind of
coincided with what

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:84%
the cover because
they didn't want

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:84%
to tell American
people that they

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%
were looking for an alien
that was involved in this.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's what they did.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to track
him at certain locations.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But when they got to those
locations, he was gone.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: Oh, OK.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And why was President Reagan
notified of this case?

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: It's a good question.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: Is that normal protocol?

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.780 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: I'm not sure.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
But the Secret Service,
because the Secret Service

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.475 align:middle line:90%
was involved in the search.

00:13:14.475 --> 00:13:15.500 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: Oh, OK.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: The Secret Service
decided that they better

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.740 align:middle line:84%
notify the president
of what was going on.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:90%
They asked permission.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I guess the person in
charge of this operation who

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:84%
was, in fact, an
intelligence officer,

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
a Colonel said, yeah,
briefed the president.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And so the President of the
United States, President Reagan,

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
was briefed on the
search for this hybrid

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in around the
Washington, DC area.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: How was this
hybrid located?

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, as I said earlier,
they had tapped phones.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for
that particular vehicle.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the phone calls
that he had made was to a house

00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:84%
in Vienna, Virginia, which was
West of Washington, DC area.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But that house wasn't listed
in any kind of directory

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.480 align:middle line:90%
as anyone living there.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the address
didn't exist.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.940 align:middle line:84%
But that's something
that we think--

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence community
thinks that the hybrid

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.380 align:middle line:90%
was able to mask somehow.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that they
ever figured this out.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But when they-- finally,
when we went there,

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.860 align:middle line:84%
when a team went there
to search this place,

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:90%
they found a woman there.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And a woman claims
she doesn't know

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:84%
anything about this Charles Dull
or this Cook, Lieutenant Cook.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
They interviewed her,
interrogated her.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:90%
But these were FBI agents.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And the FBI brought
in a special unit

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.700 align:middle line:84%
from the Virginia State Police,
a Special Operations unit,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:90%
like their SWAT team, I believe.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:53.980 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: OK.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:54.780 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: And they hadn't been
briefed on everything.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So one of the FBI
agents explained later

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:84%
when he came back to the command
post was we talked to this lady,

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and she doesn't know
anything about this guy

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.770 align:middle line:90%
and there's nobody in her home.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:84%
But then one of the
intelligence officers

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:84%
started asking this FBI agent,
what did this woman look like?

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And the more of the
descriptive nature of this lady

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.970 align:middle line:84%
that came out, we realized
then she was a hybrid.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: Oh, OK.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: So this female hybrid
was probably hiding the hybrid.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So now we know where we
think this hybrid was.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:90%
So they masked a lot of us.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was involved in this.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I was actually in
the close proximity,

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of OSI
agents were all around.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
We were actually-- look,
myself and some other agents

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:84%
were actually at a location
behind this residence.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:84%
But we found out that
this residence was,

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
in fact-- a real residence,
but it had a different number

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.192 align:middle line:84%
and somehow, the number was
changed in some directors

00:16:04.192 --> 00:16:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
how that happened.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, some of
the intelligence

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
team, the containment team
that can handle, we thought--

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:84%
now, I'm going to go
back a little bit.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:84%
We thought the Quataloid, the
one that escaped was there.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.390 align:middle line:84%
We were convinced, the teams
were convinced it was there.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And we had special
containment people

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that were used to
contain these things,

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.137 align:middle line:84%
although they could be--
their flesh and blood,

00:16:29.137 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:90%
they could be killed with a gun.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, when these teams moved
in without a search warrant,

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.830 align:middle line:84%
they just wanted
to get this thing.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.510 align:middle line:90%
They raided the house.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:90%
They found her, obviously.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
She kept telling them, no,
there's nobody here but me.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:51.820 align:middle line:84%
But there was some techniques
used by some of the intelligence

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.620 align:middle line:84%
people that knew how hybrids
operated to convince her

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:90%
that she should tell the truth.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:90%
She continued to refuse.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's when our friend, our
hybrid friend who worked for us,

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Katie Smith, and we had a
program about Katie Smith.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.140 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: All right, Katie.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.040 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: She came in and she
convinced the hybrid female

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:90%
to talk.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the female
talked to Katie privately.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:90%
They were alone.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And I guess there's some
question about how she got the--

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Katie got the information
out of this lady,

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:84%
but maybe it was--
she was reading

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:84%
her mind or some other
thing that one hybrid can

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:90%
do to another.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But the hybrid that
we were looking for,

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:84%
the male was in the
basement hiding.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And as the teams went down
there, I wasn't there.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But as the teams went down
there, they captured him,

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.010 align:middle line:90%
took him into custody.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, they brought him
out, but now they're

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:84%
still looking for the
one Quataloid that had

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:90%
escaped that they can't find.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So they thought it was
in the house someplace.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So they literally tore the house
to pieces trying to find it.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:84%
But unbeknownst to
that team, a Quataloid

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:84%
was found some
distance later dead.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So it never did leave
Bolling Air Force base,

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't know that
at the time, it was--

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:84%
at Bolling Air Force base is
right on the Potomac River.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And this thing was
probably trying to escape

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:90%
and was found near the river.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:84%
But that's how they
captured the hybrid.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:90%
They took him into custody.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.485 align:middle line:84%
They took him to a location,
a Marine Corps Base Quantico.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: Quantico, all right.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.900 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: A large
detainment center there.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, what
happened to the hybrid

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.020 align:middle line:90%
after that?

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.353 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the answer to that.

00:18:38.353 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:90%
I wish I did.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
He was detained at
Quantico, the Marine base,

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and he was probably
transferred someplace else,

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.290 align:middle line:84%
but he never stood
trial, so to speak.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: Right.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:84%
When the FBI had the description
and they're giving it

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:84%
to the Intelligence Agency
and they kind of figured out

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
this was a hybrid,
what were some

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
of the things that stood out
that they were deciphering

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:90%
how this was a hybrid?

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, first of all,
the FBI agent that actually

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:84%
interviewed this female hybrid,
not knowing she was a hybrid

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:12.250 align:middle line:84%
was a very sharp,
articulate FBI agent,

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:90%
relatively new to the FBI.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're trained to look
and watch her mannerisms.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was relating what he
was seeing in this female.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
he thought was very odd

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:90%
was her eyes.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Her eyes seemed to have
something moving inside,

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.177 align:middle line:90%
like maybe an eyelid that went--

00:19:34.177 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: Horizontally.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: --horizontal
rather than vertical.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And the nose moving more
than a human nose was moving.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And he kept relating
these traits

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:90%
to this intelligence officer.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And that set off bells in
this intelligence officer.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:84%
He was a DIA agent who
was an expert in hybrids.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately realized,
you're talking to a hybrid.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:02.410 align:middle line:84%
She's a hybrid that
you're talking to.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.498 align:middle line:84%
And so a hybrid is
hiding a hybrid.

00:20:04.498 --> 00:20:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And they thought maybe
they were husband and wife

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.810 align:middle line:90%
or acting as that.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.202 align:middle line:90%
So that's the traits.

00:20:10.202 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there
were some other things

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.827 align:middle line:90%
that I can't remember.

00:20:12.827 --> 00:20:16.140 align:middle line:84%
But everything that
the FBI agent gathered

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:84%
from his observation
of this female

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
was relayed to this
intelligence officer,

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.310 align:middle line:84%
was an expert in
identifying hybrids

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and accused him of to thinking,
OK, now she's a hybrid

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and he's probably
being hit by a hybrid.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.860 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: What was the
outcome of the search?

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Number one, we
caught the hybrid,

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.690 align:middle line:84%
We put him in a
detention facility.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:84%
We arrested the female hybrid
for harboring a fugitive.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.930 align:middle line:84%
We took her to a
location in Ohio.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was a military
base in Ohio, possibly

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Wright-Patterson Air Force
base, but I'm not sure of that.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And we eventually found that the
Quataloid that caused that harm

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:90%
some time earlier was dead.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:84%
They found him on the
banks of the Potomac River.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:90%
So the mission was complete.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: OK.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Were there any
civilian witnesses?

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what did
they report seeing?

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.170 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: The only civilian
witnesses involved

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
was the Virginia State Police,
a Special Operations team.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:84%
They were at the residence
when they were captured,

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:28.470 align:middle line:84%
but I believe they were told by
the FBI or by the Secret Service

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:90%
that we captured a spy.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: So what implications and
operations have policies now

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:39.930 align:middle line:84%
for the security measures over
at Bolling Air Force base?

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And not only just
there, but what

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.550 align:middle line:84%
about the broader
national security

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:90%
because of this incident?

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, there are new
policies and procedures created

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:84%
just for a search in
any future operations,

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:84%
looking for hybrids or any type
of extraterrestrial creatures

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:84%
that we may encounter and be
looking for that can resemble

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.200 align:middle line:84%
human beings, but primarily
the hybrids, because they're

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.800 align:middle line:84%
the ones that we
knew and we know now

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:84%
are part human and
part extraterrestrials

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.070 align:middle line:90%
and how to identify them.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.310 align:middle line:90%
The fingerprints are different.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.280 align:middle line:90%
The eyes are different.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:84%
The nose moves more
than a human nose.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.030 align:middle line:84%
The ear canals are
entirely different.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:90%
The blood is different.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:90%
The bile is different.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.740 align:middle line:84%
These things we learned
during different operations,

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.680 align:middle line:90%
particularly this operation.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And they set parameters for
any kind of future operations

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.730 align:middle line:84%
where we have to search
for extraterrestrial.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: Is there any numbers
they gave you to say, hey,

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.620 align:middle line:84%
there's X amount of these
hybrids walking amongst us here

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth?

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Yeah, in the
'80s we figured.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Somebody figured,
DIA probably figured

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.780 align:middle line:84%
that there were
literally thousands

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.990 align:middle line:90%
of hybrids walking among us.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:90%
And this was in the '80s.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.850 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: '80s, sure.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.550 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: So all these
years later, you

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.700 align:middle line:84%
might say that there
may be millions.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.500 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: At least.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Is it of concern to the
Intelligence Agency?

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: Oh, absolutely.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:84%
It has been and it was
when I was working.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And at the time that we
realized that one of our own

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Katie Smith was,
in fact, a hybrid.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.980 align:middle line:90%
But she was a friendly hybrid.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:90%
She was on our side.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:84%
We had to watch her,
but she was, in fact--

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:84%
she proved herself as being a
loyal human or a loyal American.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And she helped us
develop techniques

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:84%
to detect other hybrids that
might not be so friendly.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But yes, not only the US
intelligence community,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:84%
but everyone that had access
to the information regarding

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.420 align:middle line:84%
hybrids were concerned that
the hybrids could penetrate

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:84%
the United States government
or the United States military

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.217 align:middle line:90%
and what would happen then.

00:24:07.217 --> 00:24:08.800 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: So you worked
with hybrids side

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.790 align:middle line:90%
by side, like with Katie.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
How common is it for
you to see if there

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.530 align:middle line:90%
are friendly or unfriendly?

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.310 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, I
haven't ever worked

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.800 align:middle line:90%
with an unfriendly hybrid.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:84%
The only unfriendly
hybrid that I ever

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:84%
had any contact with
or close contact with

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:84%
was the person that
we were looking for

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:90%
in and around a DC area.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:90%
But Katie was something special.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have a
loyalty to her half

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.780 align:middle line:84%
or whatever percentage
her body was

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:90%
to the extraterrestrial race.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:90%
She had her loyalty to humans.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And so, I never encountered
a hostile hybrid,

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure they
were out there.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:84%
But I was fortunate to be
working with a loyal and very

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.467 align:middle line:90%
credible person in Katie Smith.

00:25:05.467 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: Rick, what can
you say to our viewers

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.510 align:middle line:84%
that can relate to hybrids or
even possibly feel that they

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.600 align:middle line:90%
are hybrids themselves?

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.670 align:middle line:90%
What could you tell them?

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: You know what, I actually
think that maybe we all

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:84%
have a little bit of that in
us if we are true star people

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:84%
if, in fact, you believe that
the extraterrestrials came down

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
here thousands and
thousands of years ago

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and jumped our ability to
progress from cave people

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.030 align:middle line:90%
up to where we are today.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have a
little of that in us.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, the hybrids are
a little bit different

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.950 align:middle line:84%
because they have more of the
extraterrestrial gene in them

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:84%
than the normal humans
walking this Earth.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
of contributions

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that hybrids have
given to a society.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:90%
And I'll name Katie Smith.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:84%
She provided a great deal
of service to her country

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and to the ability to identify
hostile alien species that

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.300 align:middle line:90%
are here on Earth.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think that people that
can relate to the star people,

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:84%
as I call it, or to possibly
hybrids, I would recommend they

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:84%
continue to search because
there are more better benevolent

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.610 align:middle line:84%
people out there that
could very well be

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.813 align:middle line:90%
hybrids than the bad ones.

00:26:30.813 --> 00:26:33.480 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: Richard, I want to thank
you for being on the show today.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:90%
It's been great.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: Thank you.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.430 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
