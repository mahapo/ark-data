[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.271 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: On
"Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.024 align:middle line:10%
we've heard about all types
of different ET technologies

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.359 align:middle line:10%
from our friend Emery Smith.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.362 align:middle line:84%
But today, he will talk with
us about different types

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.906 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial devices.

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:31.907 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:33.075 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:35.244 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when I hear
extraterrestrial devices,

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:39.039 align:middle line:84%
I think of "Star Trek" and
that wand that the doc had.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.499 align:middle line:90%
What are we talking about here?

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:43.919 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, that's
part of a frequency device

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:47.631 align:middle line:10%
that has actually made it
to mainstream civilian use.

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:50.676 align:middle line:10%
It's called a Scenar
Cosmodic energy.

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:55.055 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it's
able to, like a Rife machine,

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.809 align:middle line:84%
use frequency to balance
out cells and also

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.062 align:middle line:84%
communicate with cells to
go to an area of the body

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:06.942 align:middle line:84%
to fix an area, to heal a
bone, and things like that.

00:01:06.942 --> 00:01:09.152 align:middle line:84%
So this is a lot of the
reverse-engineered stuff.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:09.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:14.324 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That was found
many, many, many years ago

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.369 align:middle line:84%
and perfected today and
made it to mainstream.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.038 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other
devices have you witnessed?

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.416 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the
most fascinating thing

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:27.670 align:middle line:84%
that has been discovered
that I am fascinated by

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.551 align:middle line:84%
is the types of materials that
we recovered from these sites.

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.637 align:middle line:84%
And because the
materials are what end

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:40.183 align:middle line:84%
up later on being used, such
as carbon fiber and things

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.310 align:middle line:90%
to make bullet proof vests.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.312 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now how do you
recover them from sites?

00:01:43.312 --> 00:01:43.937 align:middle line:90%
Crash sites?

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.063 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, from crash sites.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:45.771 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.482 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We were on
a couple of retrieval

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:50.319 align:middle line:90%
teams for medical reasons.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.613 align:middle line:84%
But there's also other
things, of course,

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:59.369 align:middle line:84%
that are there on these
sites, such as liquid metals

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.247 align:middle line:84%
and different types of
substances and chemicals

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.541 align:middle line:84%
that we just don't
have here on Earth.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:11.757 align:middle line:84%
And those are all used as well
in extraterrestrial technology.

00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:13.675 align:middle line:90%
They have tools, too.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Everything just doesn't just
float around in the air.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.265 align:middle line:84%
They have special tools
that are mostly energetic,

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:21.516 align:middle line:90%
and that's what's interesting.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.727 align:middle line:84%
You might see something
that looks just

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:25.978 align:middle line:84%
like an egg-shaped
rock that you'd

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:30.776 align:middle line:84%
find on one of your
hikes, but yet it's not.

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:34.154 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a device
that emits an energy that

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:37.949 align:middle line:90%
can fix your craft, we'll say.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
They also use a lot of
crystals on-board the craft.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.412 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've heard that.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.581 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Which is very
interesting as well.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:49.586 align:middle line:84%
So these things are taken
back and reverse engineered

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
into many, many, many
different types of things.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.423 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they the
same kind of crystals

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.591 align:middle line:90%
we have on this planet now?

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:58.512 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're
very similar, but it

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:01.765 align:middle line:84%
looks like they were
definitely maybe lab grown

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.434 align:middle line:84%
because they were so
brilliant and they

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:09.564 align:middle line:84%
had very different cuts to
them, unlike we see here.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the colors
were extraordinary

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:84%
unlike any other crystals
that I've seen here on Earth.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.241 align:middle line:84%
And some are up to maybe
10 to 20 feet long,

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:23.453 align:middle line:84%
rectangular, and are like
the floor of the craft.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:28.041 align:middle line:84%
And it goes down like
an upside down triangle.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.877 align:middle line:84%
It's a power source, and
it's like a hard drive.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So it actually can record,
and it can actually

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.928 align:middle line:90%
power the craft, they learned.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:44.558 align:middle line:84%
And gives off you know all
sorts of different frequencies.

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:49.646 align:middle line:84%
And in a way is alive
in its own spectrum.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:53.942 align:middle line:84%
Crystals alone have
many capabilities,

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
depending on what you're
using the crystal for,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.113 align:middle line:84%
what kind of light
you're shining

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:04.369 align:middle line:84%
through it, what kind of laser
you're engraving information

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.203 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:05.996 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:09.458 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The crystals
do have the capability

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:11.126 align:middle line:90%
of being weapons.

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:14.421 align:middle line:84%
And crystals also have
the ability to heal.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:18.884 align:middle line:84%
And ETs obviously
know about crystals

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.136 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
their technology

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:24.389 align:middle line:90%
has crystals in them.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.935 align:middle line:84%
Look at our TV sets, see now the
first TVs, look at our radios.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.103 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they have a--

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.563 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Transistor crystal.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:32.731 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Transistor crystal.

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.318 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So how
did we know that?

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:38.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you hear
the word and phrase,

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.406 align:middle line:84%
intelligent technologies,
what does that mean to you?

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.408 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, for
me it's consciousness

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:44.326 align:middle line:90%
assisted technology.

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:45.911 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:48.413 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because most of all
of their stuff, whether it's

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:52.918 align:middle line:84%
a tool or a weapon
or a craft, it's all

00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:54.586 align:middle line:90%
assisted by your consciousness.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:58.924 align:middle line:84%
So through telepathy, you can
actually activate something.

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.176 align:middle line:84%
Or through the
bio-identical imprint

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:05.597 align:middle line:84%
of the genetic makeup of
that extraterrestrial,

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:90%
it turns it on.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.183 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like you
could turn your car

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:11.311 align:middle line:84%
on with your consciousness if
it was wired the right way.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.103 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.856 align:middle line:84%
Or pick up on your energy
frequency of your DNA

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:18.235 align:middle line:84%
because everyone has a different
frequency of their DNA,

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:19.569 align:middle line:90%
like a thumbprint.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.448 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's energetic DNA
is now recorded on the planet,

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.241 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:30.413 align:middle line:84%
So it's identifying this
person is the person that

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:33.792 align:middle line:84%
belongs to this craft,
and only the people that

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:37.128 align:middle line:84%
are registered with their
frequency can fly this craft.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:41.216 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other intelligent
technologies did they have?

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:45.637 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, like I said,
some of the most impressive ones

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:47.264 align:middle line:90%
were all consciousness assisted.

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:51.226 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I got brought
into some of these projects

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:56.815 align:middle line:84%
was because once I was working
on some samples of tissue,

00:05:56.815 --> 00:06:00.485 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, it was
related to a craft

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.572 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't even know
they had in the same I'll

00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:05.949 align:middle line:90%
say sector where I was working.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.537 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted me to come
take samples of the craft.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:16.293 align:middle line:84%
And to me at that time,
I don't ask questions.

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I get escorted to a giant
hangar and here's this craft,

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.218 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very
fleshy type of craft.

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And the craft
obviously is alive.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.766 align:middle line:84%
And taking samples
from this craft

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:35.061 align:middle line:84%
and comparing it to the
tissue sample I've had,

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.814 align:middle line:90%
it was the exact same DNA.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm getting at is the
person who had this craft,

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.198 align:middle line:84%
he made this craft from
his own genetic DNA.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:51.244 align:middle line:84%
And we found out later that
they were forming these craft

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.871 align:middle line:90%
by frequency.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:56.707 align:middle line:84%
And that means it's
always sound before form.

00:06:56.707 --> 00:07:01.254 align:middle line:84%
So you can create anything
in space using frequency

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle line:90%
and genetic DNA makeup.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.218 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the
most profound things

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:10.388 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever
witnessed in my life.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:16.227 align:middle line:84%
And there's also there was
compartments in this craft.

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:19.981 align:middle line:84%
And the craft had
tools in there.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:23.902 align:middle line:84%
They looked like I would say
tools, very odd shaped but very

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.862 align:middle line:90%
organic looking.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:29.282 align:middle line:84%
Everything always looked like
some sort of rock or stone.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you would send
an electro-impedance

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
into it utilizing the tissue,
it would do something.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.834 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What would it do?

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:44.172 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it might give
off a light, it might explode.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.216 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So these things were
taken to a very secured,

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.849 align:middle line:90%
vacuum-sealed, armor-proof.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you don't know what
the equipment was used for?

00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:01.481 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, but we would test
it through these special bomb

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:07.404 align:middle line:84%
containers, these containers
that can protect you

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:11.324 align:middle line:84%
if it were to
explode or if it were

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.077 align:middle line:90%
to do something to harm us.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And they would measure
many different sensors

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.915 align:middle line:90%
in this unit, this special type.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.459 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a giant
hyperbaric chamber,

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:25.755 align:middle line:84%
giant oval thing with
very small glass portals.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:29.259 align:middle line:84%
And you used robotic arms from
the outside and stuff to--

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.428 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like you put your
hands in them, like that?

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, no, you
don't put your hands in.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.431 align:middle line:84%
You operate from outside
of the container.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:35.222 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:08:35.222 --> 00:08:39.602 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it's like what
they do today with surgery,

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:40.812 align:middle line:90%
if you heard about--

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:41.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Robotic surgery.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:42.731 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Robotic surgery.

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Now you could be a surgeon.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.358 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Make an
incision, stick it in.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.151 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:49.279 align:middle line:84%
And you can be here in the
United States operating

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.196 align:middle line:90%
on someone in Dubai.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:50.989 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:51.781 align:middle line:90%
It's electronics.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.241 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So just
like this, but we

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:90%
were doing in a protective way.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And some of these devices
gave off brilliant light,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.458 align:middle line:90%
but we didn't know what it was.

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:05.003 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting is
it was all photon-related,

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.463 align:middle line:90%
light-related.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:11.092 align:middle line:84%
And these craft, as many
people see in the air,

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:14.596 align:middle line:84%
are giving off these interesting
colored rainbow lights.

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.223 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
instruments and things

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.809 align:middle line:84%
that were on these craft
would do the same thing

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:24.147 align:middle line:84%
once they were
activated with the DNA.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.982 align:middle line:84%
And so then these
things would be

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:28.151 align:middle line:84%
given off to
different compartments

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:31.029 align:middle line:84%
and studied for years and
years and years and years.

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.865 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes if we
couldn't figure it out,

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:36.618 align:middle line:84%
we have spies and other
places like the Vatican

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:39.996 align:middle line:84%
and other areas of the planet
that are doing similar work.

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:40.789 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:43.792 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And when we know they
have something similar to this,

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.711 align:middle line:84%
we'll make an exchange
trade, since maybe

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.713 align:middle line:90%
they already figured it out.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:54.427 align:middle line:84%
So we would get sent over there
to collect another specimen

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:58.264 align:middle line:84%
or to read up on their
data, what they already

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.391 align:middle line:84%
had been trained on
for five or 10 years,

00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:04.604 align:middle line:84%
even though we just currently
got it into our system.

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.439 align:middle line:84%
And that was another
amazing thing.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.275 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these
tools that were there

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:84%
were actually keys
for certain things,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.781 align:middle line:84%
to open certain
things they found out.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:18.409 align:middle line:84%
There was sound to some of these
things when they were boosting

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:19.744 align:middle line:90%
up, which was interesting.

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.413 align:middle line:84%
And we have special people
that were there just

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:25.542 align:middle line:84%
to measure the light and
the frequency, scientists.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.709 align:middle line:90%
That's all they do.

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.504 align:middle line:84%
And they compare it
to other databases

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:34.467 align:middle line:84%
from around the planet,
which was very interesting.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:39.764 align:middle line:84%
But I never really got to
grab a device and utilize it.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.724 align:middle line:90%
I was only able to see it.

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:43.601 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
a tissue expert, right?

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:44.394 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:46.896 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did they have you
involved with these devices?

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.524 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because
I had to harvest

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:52.652 align:middle line:90%
the tissue, usually from both.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.822 align:middle line:84%
The devices will not
work unless the tissue

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:59.284 align:middle line:84%
from the craft and the
tissue from the person who

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.286 align:middle line:90%
had the craft are together.

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.078 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:02.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:03.538 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:07.876 align:middle line:90%
And that activated these things.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:12.046 align:middle line:84%
And then we found out that
the craft alone, once we

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:16.217 align:middle line:84%
took one of these pieces
of devices that we knew

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.386 align:middle line:84%
was harmless, but we
didn't know what it did.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.178 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:23.892 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We took it out of the
craft and away from the craft

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:29.063 align:middle line:84%
and utilized the tissue within
a certain amount of yards,

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:30.982 align:middle line:90%
that it would still work.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.359 align:middle line:84%
But if you went too far
away from the craft,

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.694 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't activate.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:37.447 align:middle line:84%
So there were some
energy field that they

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.449 align:middle line:90%
were trying to figure out.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.366 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.868 align:middle line:90%
Is that a Bluetooth energy?

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:42.785 align:middle line:90%
Is it a frequency?

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Is it photons?

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.664 align:middle line:84%
We don't see anything,
but somehow the craft

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:49.208 align:middle line:84%
knows that this
piece of equipment

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:54.339 align:middle line:84%
is now this far away, even
though it's genetically still

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:57.967 align:middle line:84%
running an electrical impedance
through it for the cells

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:01.429 align:middle line:84%
to be active, that
it doesn't work.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.848 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would these
devices sometimes, Emery,

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:08.269 align:middle line:84%
work on their own where they
just started doing something?

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:09.979 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:13.983 align:middle line:84%
Some devices would start to heal
the craft where the craft maybe

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.319 align:middle line:90%
had a gash in it.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:19.405 align:middle line:84%
So imagine like a bunch
of small little rocks

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.282 align:middle line:90%
going over an area trying to--

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.283 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To patch it up?

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:25.244 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: To patch it up
and working on its own

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:28.581 align:middle line:84%
in a non-threatening manner
with beautiful lights.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:36.172 align:middle line:84%
And just an amazing show
of light and frequency.

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:40.635 align:middle line:84%
And we wouldn't do anything
but just observe and watch.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:43.805 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe even though the
person is not in the craft,

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:47.016 align:middle line:90%
maybe that is the person.

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:48.101 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That could be.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.102 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You understand
what I'm saying?

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:49.978 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be.

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.479 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that's
another concept

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:55.525 align:middle line:84%
I don't talk about too often
is that many craft, I believe,

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.986 align:middle line:90%
are actually extraterrestrial.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.362 align:middle line:90%
They are the ET.

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:01.155 align:middle line:90%
They're conscious, these craft.

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:03.116 align:middle line:90%
They have a conscious to them.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.701 align:middle line:84%
And when you know
about the physics

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.954 align:middle line:84%
of the future of the
atomic structures

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:13.001 align:middle line:84%
and how atoms can be displaced
and rearranged in many ways,

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.837 align:middle line:84%
like in teletransportation
when they break down

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:18.172 align:middle line:84%
your whole entire
body, and then they

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:20.091 align:middle line:90%
re-assimilate it over here.

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:22.093 align:middle line:84%
And that's already
been conquered, too.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:25.763 align:middle line:84%
Well, man, these ETs
that are millions

00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:28.599 align:middle line:84%
of years more advanced
than we are obviously

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.393 align:middle line:90%
can do a lot more than that.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And people just think
of an ET as a 3D entity.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.315 align:middle line:84%
But they're not,
they're light bodies

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:39.986 align:middle line:84%
that can manifest into
many different things.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they
can actually be craft.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:48.286 align:middle line:84%
The whole craft by
itself acting on its own

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:56.252 align:middle line:84%
without a visible person or
ET there, and fixing itself,

00:13:56.252 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and dematerializing
and leaving the area,

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.593 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing where
it went or what it did,

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.511 align:middle line:84%
was probably one of the
most amazing sights.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.471 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right under your eyes.

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:07.305 align:middle line:90%
Poof, gone.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Just unfolds in
itself, and a small light,

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.478 align:middle line:90%
and it's gone.

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.146 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did it go?

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:17.106 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It probably
went inter-dimensional,

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:19.442 align:middle line:84%
it probably went into
another dimension.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:22.487 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting is
this has happened many times,

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:26.282 align:middle line:84%
I found out later,
through the projects.

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:29.744 align:middle line:84%
I was just very lucky to
witness something like this.

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:33.498 align:middle line:90%
And so for me that's more than--

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:34.790 align:middle line:90%
that's a extra intelligence.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:35.917 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.795 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that
intelligence fascinates me

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:41.214 align:middle line:84%
because that's what we're
going to be someday.

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And I hope we're going to
be there sooner than later.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.011 align:middle line:84%
And there was many
people on these teams.

00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:48.554 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I'm
the only person.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:49.347 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:54.268 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But my specific
specialty was that.

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:56.646 align:middle line:84%
So if they saw
something, maybe there

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.857 align:middle line:84%
was something on the floor or
up on the ceiling that looked

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:01.734 align:middle line:90%
like a piece of organic--

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.444 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're like
the crime scene guy.

00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:04.362 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:05.488 align:middle line:90%
This is kind of what it is.

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:07.573 align:middle line:90%
It's a forensic thing.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.867 align:middle line:84%
So we would go in
there in our suits

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:15.623 align:middle line:84%
and use just regular
sterile ladders and things

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.166 align:middle line:90%
and figure these things out.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:20.002 align:middle line:84%
And take these
samples and bag them

00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:22.004 align:middle line:84%
and tag them, and take
them back to the lab.

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:23.131 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what happened?

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:24.799 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And run tests on them.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what
happened afterwards?

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:90%
Who confiscated them?

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.387 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What I
believe, and came

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:32.223 align:middle line:84%
to the conclusion is,
after they find out

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:36.769 align:middle line:84%
what these tissues are,
what vibrations they hold,

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:40.523 align:middle line:84%
what crystalline structures
their DNA is made up of,

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:43.526 align:middle line:84%
they utilize these
things and they sell them

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:47.405 align:middle line:84%
to big pharma and other
corporations the data.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.615 align:middle line:84%
And they'll make
synthetic versions of this

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:54.579 align:middle line:84%
and make it into medicines
or weapons or whatever.

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:55.746 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I believe.

00:15:55.746 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These technologies are
literally out of this world.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.339 align:middle line:84%
When will we see them applied
to making our lives better?

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:06.924 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, we do every day.

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:09.427 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every day there's
something released, such as--

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we don't know
it's from that source.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.846 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:13.347 align:middle line:84%
We don't know it's
from that source.

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:16.767 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they just came out with
a graphene diamond material

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:19.604 align:middle line:84%
that's a millimeter
thick and bulletproof.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:25.067 align:middle line:84%
And I was recently
talking about these plants

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:30.031 align:middle line:84%
that we were retrieving
from different places

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:35.161 align:middle line:84%
of an unknown origin that
were thin and bulletproof.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.955 align:middle line:84%
And what's funny is they
come up with new names.

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:40.833 align:middle line:84%
One was recently let
off to the public,

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:43.711 align:middle line:90%
and it's a new amazing fabric.

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:47.381 align:middle line:84%
And it's graphene
mixed with diamonds.

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:48.966 align:middle line:84%
And they come up
with this new name

00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:53.012 align:middle line:84%
of this new substance, which I
know 100% where they got that

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:53.804 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:54.722 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:57.308 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So when you
see these new substances

00:16:57.308 --> 00:16:59.518 align:middle line:84%
and these new
materials come out,

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:03.439 align:middle line:84%
you can probably bet your
bottom dollar that it definitely

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:84%
was reverse engineered
or actually came

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.444 align:middle line:84%
from an extraterrestrial
craft or extraterrestrial

00:17:09.444 --> 00:17:11.196 align:middle line:90%
that they reverse engineered.

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:14.157 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This kind of
technology, was it given to us,

00:17:14.157 --> 00:17:15.284 align:middle line:90%
or did we find it?

00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:18.412 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe,
because I'm not

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:20.623 align:middle line:84%
allowed to ask too
many questions,

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:23.251 align:middle line:84%
but as you get in there
more and more and more,

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle line:84%
you get to listen a little
bit more to the higher-ups,

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.799 align:middle line:90%
and they let you in on things.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:34.553 align:middle line:84%
And I think intentionally
ETs crashed ships here

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:38.766 align:middle line:84%
for us to find to help us
evolve a little bit faster.

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:42.645 align:middle line:84%
But there are many craft of
course that we have shot down.

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:47.316 align:middle line:10%
And there are many craft in
the space salvaging program,

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:49.777 align:middle line:10%
I call it, that
they are cleaning

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:52.029 align:middle line:10%
up there because there's
a lot of things floating

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:54.782 align:middle line:10%
around up there in space
that they'd bring back,

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:56.242 align:middle line:10%
many instruments.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:10%
One episode I talk about
this harpoon-type of device

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.873 align:middle line:10%
with an arm that was
still attached to it.

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:10%
These things are very valuable
to the corporations down here.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.588 align:middle line:84%
And they like to
bring them back,

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:11.424 align:middle line:84%
they like to test
them, they like

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:19.098 align:middle line:84%
to see how the body is
interacting with which

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:21.559 align:middle line:84%
is answering your question,
consciousness-assisted

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:22.768 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:27.773 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with that and also
the biology of that person.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.734 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever seen a device,

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.944 align:middle line:90%
used it, to cure something?

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Anything like that?

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.572 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:40.244 align:middle line:84%
Actually being around
extraterrestrial bodies

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:43.164 align:middle line:84%
and being around
extraterrestrial craft,

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:47.960 align:middle line:84%
we had many scientists
who had cancers and have

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.922 align:middle line:90%
had other debilitating things.

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:54.133 align:middle line:84%
I actually had a
very bad disease.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:55.801 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.178 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: At one time.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:19:01.599 align:middle line:84%
And after being and
working on this craft,

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:05.811 align:middle line:84%
this man's cancer was completely
gone with no more tumors.

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:10.691 align:middle line:84%
And the blood borne disease
I had was immediately gone,

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:12.651 align:middle line:84%
which I didn't know
until I got tested.

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:15.863 align:middle line:84%
It had to do, obviously,
with this frequency

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:19.367 align:middle line:84%
that this craft was giving off
that rearranged the genetics.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:20.409 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your molecules.

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:21.869 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The
molecules or something

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:27.708 align:middle line:84%
to remove these negative ionic
cancers and cells and things

00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:28.501 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.877 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we reproduce that?

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:31.462 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: So that's what we did.

00:19:31.462 --> 00:19:34.048 align:middle line:84%
So we reproduced these
systems, these Teslatron units.

00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.551 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That you
sit in these rooms.

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And you this dose
of this energy,

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.562 align:middle line:84%
and we were able to
cure HIV in a month.

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By sitting in this--

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: By sitting in this--

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.108 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a Teslatron?

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's a unit that
Tesla developed-- of course,

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.739 align:middle line:84%
the Tesla coil over
a long time ago.

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:90%
And there was a doctor--

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.829 align:middle line:84%
I won't say his name, he
just recently passed away,

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:07.957 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of the viewers
know who I'm talking about--

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:11.919 align:middle line:84%
came up with this device
that you sit in a room

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:16.382 align:middle line:84%
and you get these doses of
this frequency from this unit.

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:22.138 align:middle line:84%
And it somehow teletransports
the negative stuff out

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:22.972 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:23.806 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:25.182 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it
was just recently

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:29.562 align:middle line:84%
taken over by
someone who does not

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.772 align:middle line:84%
want me to have
access to it anymore,

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:34.733 align:middle line:84%
because I was going to
bring it out to the public.

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.986 align:middle line:84%
But I just had a
recent email come

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:41.615 align:middle line:84%
in from someone that says that
they have another one, that we

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:42.408 align:middle line:90%
should talk.

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:45.536 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to engage
in this because this

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:49.248 align:middle line:84%
is such a cost-effective
cheap thing to have out there.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.875 align:middle line:84%
It needs a lot more
testing, of course.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:51.667 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And it's here.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.297 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about getting
the people and the engineers

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.591 align:middle line:84%
and the people who own
the patents on this

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:02.344 align:middle line:84%
and the government
to say, OK, you

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:04.263 align:middle line:84%
can have this device
come out, but you

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:07.141 align:middle line:84%
can't claim it cures
anything, you can't do that.

00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I tricked
the patent corporation.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.024 align:middle line:84%
Many of my patents were turned
down because I was saying,

00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:17.109 align:middle line:84%
well, I concentrated
stem cells with this

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:20.529 align:middle line:84%
and we injected it into
100 patients' spinal cord.

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:21.739 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were all cured.

00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They were all cured.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.033 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't say that.

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:25.201 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:28.704 align:middle line:84%
But I can say, well,
I made this device,

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:33.167 align:middle line:84%
it concentrates blood cells,
and it's up to the doctor

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:34.502 align:middle line:90%
how he wants to utilize it.

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:35.544 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, that's OK.

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:37.546 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, yeah, that's OK.

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:40.549 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why aren't we
getting this technology right

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
now to cure some of these things
that you said you tested on?

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.848 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I mean,
you know how long

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
it took stem cells to
get to the general public

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.686 align:middle line:90%
so we can use it in the US.

00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:56.649 align:middle line:84%
Yet China and England and
Thailand, everyone else

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:58.067 align:middle line:84%
has been using
these technologies.

00:21:58.067 --> 00:21:59.652 align:middle line:10%
So there's a lot
of cures already

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:05.115 align:middle line:10%
out there technology-wise that
other countries are utilizing,

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:08.577 align:middle line:10%
but it's just hard to get it
here through the system because

00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:12.998 align:middle line:10%
of all the politics involved
with the FDA, with big pharma.

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:16.293 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the FDA gets 80% of
their money from big pharma.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:18.379 align:middle line:84%
They're going to approve
their stuff a lot faster.

00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:19.838 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, half
the staff members of the FDA

00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:20.714 align:middle line:90%
were in big pharma.

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:22.967 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You have these
amazing physicians coming out

00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:26.971 align:middle line:84%
with anti-aging or
regenerative proteins

00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:30.015 align:middle line:84%
that will take at
least 20 years to get

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.475 align:middle line:84%
to the public,
which is ridiculous

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:32.643 align:middle line:90%
because they're all natural.

00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:33.811 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's right now.

00:22:33.811 --> 00:22:35.521 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's right now.

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:39.733 align:middle line:84%
And then you have these amazing
physicists and engineers

00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:44.863 align:middle line:84%
who have made these amazing
devices that I mentioned.

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:49.535 align:middle line:84%
They're too scared to come out
because it does demonstrate

00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:50.327 align:middle line:90%
one other thing.

00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:52.788 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to slap a
National Security Act on them

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and say, you can't build this
because this technology is

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.711 align:middle line:84%
property of the United
States of America.

00:22:58.711 --> 00:22:59.545 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:01.589 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
going to be the biggest

00:23:01.589 --> 00:23:06.051 align:middle line:84%
technological breakthrough that
we got from ET technology that

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:06.844 align:middle line:90%
goes public?

00:23:06.844 --> 00:23:12.141 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's going to
be, hopefully, next year

00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:14.977 align:middle line:84%
or the year after, and
it's going to be overunity.

00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:18.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it sounds
like it's coming from you?

00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:18.897 align:middle line:90%
Possible.

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:19.898 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, well.

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:20.858 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what will that do?

00:23:20.858 --> 00:23:21.775 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's what I do?

00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:22.901 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What will that do?

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:28.657 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's going to change
everything because if you can

00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:31.493 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate overunity,
which we've already done--

00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:33.537 align:middle line:84%
and it's out of my
hands, by the way.

00:23:33.537 --> 00:23:38.125 align:middle line:84%
It's all been taken away from me
and in it's a very safe place.

00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's what the
ETs use, and that's

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.588 align:middle line:84%
why they don't want people to
know ETs exist because then

00:23:42.588 --> 00:23:44.465 align:middle line:84%
the scientists will say
how do they get here,

00:23:44.465 --> 00:23:47.009 align:middle line:84%
well they used
zero-point energy.

00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:50.179 align:middle line:84%
So when you prove these things,
that you can make energy

00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:56.101 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over and over,
now you're going to get killed.

00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:59.229 align:middle line:84%
It's like you've got to be very
careful of how you do this.

00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:01.106 align:middle line:84%
So you incorporate
them and you say,

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:05.027 align:middle line:84%
hey, why don't we cut
down on the nuclear stuff

00:24:05.027 --> 00:24:07.196 align:middle line:90%
and incorporate this.

00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:09.573 align:middle line:84%
And even though we
still have to pay money,

00:24:09.573 --> 00:24:11.909 align:middle line:84%
at least we're going to
have a cleaner atmosphere.

00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:15.788 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, just
like any technology,

00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:17.039 align:middle line:90%
it'll get more improved.

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:21.043 align:middle line:84%
And more and more countries
will take this on board.

00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:23.379 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain countries
actually utilizing this.

00:24:23.379 --> 00:24:23.962 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doing it now.

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right now.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.298 align:middle line:84%
They're not telling
the civilians.

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.258 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where it came
and where it came from.

00:24:28.258 --> 00:24:29.051 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:24:29.051 --> 00:24:32.137 align:middle line:84%
Because they're still saving
money on buying the oil

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:35.516 align:middle line:84%
they need to run
their factories,

00:24:35.516 --> 00:24:37.393 align:middle line:84%
cutting the cost down
on that because they're

00:24:37.393 --> 00:24:40.979 align:middle line:84%
using half free energy,
half gas, coal, and oil.

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we get an
extraterrestrial craft

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.237 align:middle line:84%
that lands somewhere quietly and
gives us some technology that's

00:24:48.237 --> 00:24:49.571 align:middle line:90%
going to change the planet?

00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.448 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
they already have.

00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:52.491 align:middle line:90%
This is what's going on.

00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:55.411 align:middle line:84%
It's slowly being released
is what I'm getting at.

00:24:55.411 --> 00:24:57.413 align:middle line:84%
They've been sharing
the technologies.

00:24:57.413 --> 00:25:04.253 align:middle line:84%
It's just sometimes we mess up
and we turn their backs on them

00:25:04.253 --> 00:25:07.589 align:middle line:84%
because we use the technologies
maybe for the wrong thing.

00:25:07.589 --> 00:25:10.551 align:middle line:84%
Or we use it for war
or we black box it

00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:13.762 align:middle line:84%
and try to keep it just
for certain organizations,

00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:18.559 align:middle line:84%
individuals,
corporations, politics.

00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And so right now it's like
how can we trust these guys.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.733 align:middle line:84%
We've already went back on
our word a million times.

00:25:25.733 --> 00:25:29.069 align:middle line:84%
So let's just slowly trickle
out some stuff to them,

00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:31.155 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be smart
enough to come up with it.

00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:33.741 align:middle line:84%
And there's many,
many devices out there

00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:84%
of overunity, and many
brilliant scientists

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.244 align:middle line:90%
that have already done it.

00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:38.871 align:middle line:84%
But of course, it's
not just something

00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:43.459 align:middle line:84%
you just can come out and
say you did it and give.

00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:44.543 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I wish we could.

00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But there are
people behind the project

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:52.593 align:middle line:84%
now that I handed
everything over to that,

00:25:52.593 --> 00:25:56.138 align:middle line:84%
for the most important part,
is they don't want any money.

00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:56.930 align:middle line:90%
It's the first.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:57.973 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's rare.

00:25:57.973 --> 00:25:59.391 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's the
first investment

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.559 align:middle line:90%
group that comes forward.

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.728 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think we're
going to be able to use it?

00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:03.604 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, yeah,
definitely we'll

00:26:03.604 --> 00:26:04.730 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to use it.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.775 align:middle line:84%
It's going to trickle out,
it's going to be in a safe way.

00:26:07.775 --> 00:26:11.278 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
government will honor it

00:26:11.278 --> 00:26:13.906 align:middle line:90%
with open hands and open arms.

00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
glad you have had

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:90%
a glimpse of this technology?

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.286 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sometimes.

00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:20.788 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or is it a curse?

00:26:20.788 --> 00:26:24.583 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it's been
a curse for quite a while.

00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:27.544 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard
to come forward.

00:26:27.544 --> 00:26:31.381 align:middle line:84%
But after the
support of everyone

00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:35.803 align:middle line:84%
coming forward as well
and all the listeners

00:26:35.803 --> 00:26:40.724 align:middle line:84%
out there giving me
positive responses back,

00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:44.812 align:middle line:84%
helping to protect me
because if they kill me now,

00:26:44.812 --> 00:26:46.605 align:middle line:90%
I'll look like a martyr.

00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:47.564 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:49.441 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And you don't
want that to happen.

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:53.237 align:middle line:84%
It was an unnerving choice to
do it, but I had to at the time

00:26:53.237 --> 00:26:55.823 align:middle line:84%
because it was
getting too heated.

00:26:55.823 --> 00:27:00.202 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just trying to do
something good for the earth

00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:01.161 align:middle line:90%
and everyone.

00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:04.248 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
destroy big gas, coal,

00:27:04.248 --> 00:27:05.791 align:middle line:90%
and oil and big pharma.

00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:07.918 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually trying to
bring us all together

00:27:07.918 --> 00:27:10.087 align:middle line:84%
and work together
to clean it up.

00:27:10.087 --> 00:27:12.589 align:middle line:84%
You can still make money off
us, but there's other ways

00:27:12.589 --> 00:27:17.386 align:middle line:84%
to do things, that we should
appreciate this planet and all

00:27:17.386 --> 00:27:20.514 align:middle line:84%
the beings on the
planet and come together

00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:24.893 align:middle line:84%
as one unified group
of conscious people

00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:29.106 align:middle line:84%
so we can talk to our
brothers and sisters

00:27:29.106 --> 00:27:31.608 align:middle line:84%
amongst the stars,
which is why I'm here.

00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:32.818 align:middle line:90%
I really want that to happen.

00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:33.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:27:33.735 --> 00:27:35.821 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because
we deserve this.

00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:38.824 align:middle line:84%
We've been through
a lot, everyone.

00:27:38.824 --> 00:27:40.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about the planet.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.994 align:middle line:90%
And we need help.

00:27:41.994 --> 00:27:44.329 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Emery, thanks for
being on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:45.622 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Thanks for
having me, George.

00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:47.291 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm George
Noory, and thanks

00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:50.335 align:middle line:84%
for watching
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:54.339 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure," where

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:57.092 align:middle line:10%
people share their clandestine
involvement with government

00:27:57.092 --> 00:28:00.345 align:middle line:10%
agencies, the military,
and secret space programs.

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:02.723 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Enormous craft,
larger than a football field

00:28:02.723 --> 00:28:03.181 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.099 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:05.601 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And some
are very small,

00:28:05.601 --> 00:28:07.561 align:middle line:90%
as big as a Volkswagen Beetle.

00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:10.272 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: But the
problem with anything

00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:13.817 align:middle line:84%
that has secret in the
name is the small print

00:28:13.817 --> 00:28:16.528 align:middle line:84%
that you won't find
out about for decades.

00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:18.864 align:middle line:84%
He said we're gonna borrow
your consciousness

00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:20.449 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be gone
for 20 years.

00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:22.075 align:middle line:90%
