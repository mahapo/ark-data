00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.610 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:10%
we are with Randy Cramer who
has participated in a covert

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:10%
military space program for 18
years called the Earth Defense

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.930 align:middle line:10%
Force.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking about
extraterrestrial healing

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.827 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY CRAMER:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: From what you have
been exposed to off-planet,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the most
advanced technologies you can

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:90%
share with us?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, I mean,
medical healing technologies,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.870 align:middle line:84%
the ability to restore cellular
structures from damaged tissue

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:90%
to healthy tissue in--

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I say sometimes seconds.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, some of
the stuff we have takes hours

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
or days even to do something
that is still pretty miraculous

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:90%
to regrow an arm or something.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.435 align:middle line:84%
But some of the most
advanced tech can do it in--

00:01:07.435 --> 00:01:09.835 align:middle line:90%
I mean, seconds or near seconds.

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you explain
in more detail what are they

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:90%
doing?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.400 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: There's probably at
least a half a dozen different

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
ways in which this can be
done, from what I understand.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
The most familiar I'm with
is holographic projection

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:84%
technology, which
uses a hologram that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
has a resolution that
is at cellular level.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So the hologram--
if you could look

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
at the hologram
with a microscope,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
you could see individual
cells in the hologram

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.210 align:middle line:84%
so that when projected over the
body over damaged tissue, let's

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:84%
say my hand had a third-degree
burn all the way across of it.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So projecting the
healthy hologram

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:84%
of the healthy cells over the
damaged tissue through dominant

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.050 align:middle line:84%
harmonic frequency resonance
causes the damaged tissue

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:84%
to basically want to be like
the healthy holographic pattern

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.019 align:middle line:90%
and go--

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:84%
the damaged cell
goes, I'm damaged.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And it looks at this perfect
version of itself and it goes,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:90%
I want to be like that.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And then it repairs
itself, which to me

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
is the most amazing
part of that technology.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Is that the tool itself
isn't healing your body.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
The tool itself isn't
regenerating your tissue.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
The tool is just
telling your body

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:84%
to regenerate your own
tissue and to fix itself.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So the tool itself,
the technology

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:84%
itself is not fixing anything,
is not healing anything,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.140 align:middle line:84%
is not repairing
anything, your body

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
is still what does
all the repair,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.970 align:middle line:84%
all the fixing, all
the cellular changing.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
But it does so simply
at being prompted

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
by a holographic image that
fools the cells in your body

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that
the cells next to it

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.965 align:middle line:90%
are perfectly healthy.

00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So it's like giving it
its own correct mapping system

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.375 align:middle line:90%
for it to replicate.

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And it basically just wants to
conform to the healthier image,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.750 align:middle line:90%
the healthier resonance.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.167 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What
else have you seen?

00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Basically like a
foamy gel that's got to be stem

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:84%
cells or something in it that
they can just take and just

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.340 align:middle line:90%
slather over a wound.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:84%
You could have a chunk
taken out of your arm,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and they'd just slather
that goo into your arm

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.973 align:middle line:84%
and then your body would talk
to the biological cellular

00:03:38.973 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
structure of the stem
cells or whatever that's

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:84%
in that goo foam,
and then it just

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.867 align:middle line:84%
makes new cells
where they would--

00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:84%
it just turns into the kind of
cells in your arm that it needs

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.204 align:middle line:90%
to be because they're--

00:03:50.204 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:84%
you know more about stem
cells than I do, but--

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.688 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: --somehow the stem
cells know what to be when

00:03:55.688 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:84%
they're told to be a
certain type of cells.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.985 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, we want to
be an arm skin cell.

00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And then they just do that.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
They're using exosomes and the
stem cells and growth factors

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:90%
to help train those cells.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably
another synthetic mode

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
of that or something
that they actually

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:84%
made from the patient's
own possible blood.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.518 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: But I've seen that
in the projects as well.

00:04:16.518 --> 00:04:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I have also seen
people lose parts that they

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:90%
could regrow.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
A new limb in a
chamber that's again

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
from a foamy goo or a
programmable stem cell

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
or some time and it
grows into the limb.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And then they just
surgically replace it

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:90%
with a transplant surgery.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little
bit more about how

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:90%
the devices are applying this.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:90%
The applications.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And is it like a
chamber of sorts or--

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Most of my
personal experience,

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:84%
there's the equivalent of a
hospital bed or a surgery bed

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:84%
which has some equipment around
it in the case of a hollow bed.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It's basically got
a holographic lens,

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
a projector about a meter above
the bed unit and projects down.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I have seen similar
units, either used

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:84%
by other departments or other
species that are basically

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:84%
like an egg that you
get into that opens up

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and you slide into it,
and then it closes up

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's all self-contained
like in a giant

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:90%
plastic, metal egg or whatever.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.525 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Like a vat, yeah.

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Something like that.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I've seen where a person was
inserted into a tube like a vat

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:84%
that then everything
that happened

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.040 align:middle line:84%
happens in a sterile
liquid environment.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's like embryotic
fluid almost.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the most equivalent like
an embryotic fluid so that when

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:84%
you're in it, it wants to
rejuvenate your cells and keeps

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.005 align:middle line:84%
infections away so that all
the stuff that they're--

00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:84%
any surgeries or things that
the device is doing while

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
you're inside is completely
sterile and completely

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:90%
disease-free, bug-free, so--

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.795 align:middle line:90%
microbe-free.

00:06:10.795 --> 00:06:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So these
devices and technologies,

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:84%
can they be used within
different species?

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.520 align:middle line:84%
The holographic
regenerating medical beds,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.610 align:middle line:84%
basically, just take a
blood sample or anything

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that can get a DNA sample,
so it gets an ideal pattern.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And then that goes into
a computer that can then

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:90%
recreate and project the image.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So as long as it's a readable
form of DNA sequencing

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that that computer
can read, it can

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:84%
create the projection of
the perfect cellular map

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.350 align:middle line:90%
for that being.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you ever heard
of them utilizing those types

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.300 align:middle line:84%
of technology for like
hybridization or maybe growing

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.745 align:middle line:84%
different types of beings
with that technology?

00:06:55.745 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: That's kind
of out of my wheelhouse.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I've heard rumors of
such things and projects,

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:90%
but never witnessed anything.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:90%
So I would just say, probably.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.930 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is cloning
a similar technology?

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I don't think
that it necessarily is.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my understanding
is, when you already

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.850 align:middle line:84%
have a mass of tissue that
you're trying to repair,

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
there may be some similar
science and technology

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
involved, but it's just
totally not the same thing

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.735 align:middle line:84%
from trying to regrow a
massive tissue from a finger.

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:33.535 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:07:33.535 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: That's way different.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Trying to repair this,
even if it's 2/3 damaged,

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:84%
is just not the same
as trying to build

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.395 align:middle line:90%
a whole person from this.

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is there like a
cut off or a percentage?

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Since you've been to a lot
of these wars and different

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
planets, where you might have a
VIP warrior that they put a lot

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
into it and all of
a sudden, he's--

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
from the torso down, there's
nothing left and are they

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:90%
going to maybe re-clone him?

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to try
to re-holographic image

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:90%
all his appendages back?

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.605 align:middle line:90%
What's been your experience?

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: In my
personal experience,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the least amount
of material that someone ever

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
brought back of mine was a
portion of my skull and most

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:90%
of my brain inside my helmet.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Like here, this is what
we have left of him.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to keep my
brain alive and reform my skull

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.048 align:middle line:84%
and then transplant
that onto another body.

00:08:39.048 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't grow a
whole other body from that.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.120 align:middle line:84%
But they were able to get
the head and the skull

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:90%
and the brain back together.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.615 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And the
information problem.

00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:48.267 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: All
that consciousness,

00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:90%
everything is attached to there?

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to keep the
head together and the brain,

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
but had to transplant
that onto a new body.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did you have total
recall of that incident?

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: No.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't remember
that incident at all.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:84%
I remember the part of my head
flipping off of my shoulders

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and spinning through the air
and then blacking out and then

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:84%
coming to later, I had the rest
of the story explained to me.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:90%
But you know--

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And the audience
should know too that

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.741 align:middle line:90%
the technologies that you were--

00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say that you were
exposed to at that time, that's

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.975 align:middle line:90%
a possibility.

00:09:28.975 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people would
look at this now saying,

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:31.725 align:middle line:90%
oh, he lost his head.

00:09:31.725 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But with the
advanced technologies

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
like cryo and other
things, as long

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.695 align:middle line:84%
as they have a little bit
of that, they can recover.

00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.970 align:middle line:84%
As long as there's apparently
enough electrical activity

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, they can take
the helmet with the brain

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
stuff in it, put it into a
stasis chamber, which basically

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:84%
slows down time
so that the tissue

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
in the skull and the brain
is dying much, much slower.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So much more slowly that
you can take the time

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
to get that chunk
into stabilization.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
work on stabilization

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:84%
by regenerating tissue
and keeping it alive

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.470 align:middle line:90%
and regrowing it.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.543 align:middle line:84%
And once you've got the
brain back together,

00:10:18.543 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
then it's just putting
everything else back together

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:21.668 align:middle line:90%
from what I understand.

00:10:21.668 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:90%
So that's the hard part.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:90%
I was lucky, apparently.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.952 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Maybe you
can verify this for me.

00:10:25.952 --> 00:10:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I have heard of these
special suits and helmets

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that actually, if
you do get hurt,

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.157 align:middle line:84%
they could preserve a body
part or the whole body.

00:10:35.157 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about this?

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: It would
not surprise me.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I certainly know
that the suits were

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:90%
designed to be self-preserving.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.632 align:middle line:84%
So you've got like
automatic tourniquets

00:10:48.632 --> 00:10:50.090 align:middle line:84%
in the arms and
the legs and stuff,

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:90%
so when a leg is blown off.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:90%
But it would--

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm a
smart enough person

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:84%
that some other smart tech
engineer probably thought way

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
before I ever thought of it
that some of these things you

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:90%
could put in the suit.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a suit that
can create a temporary stasis

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:84%
field around the
brain or something

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:90%
to hold them together, yeah.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It makes sense to me
that tools would just

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:84%
continue to be developed to make
that easier to retrieve people

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:23.375 align:middle line:84%
that there's not much
pieces or parts of them

00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:84%
to retrieve that you
want to keep them alive.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.487 align:middle line:84%
I like what you said
about energy fields

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
because it's not always like a
helmet or a piece of the suit,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.700 align:middle line:84%
it's the field of that device
that creates you to be intact.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Correct.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:36.830 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.288 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What about technology
that has to do with mental,

00:11:39.288 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
emotional, and
spiritual healing?

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything like
that that was brought up

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.665 align:middle line:90%
to help people with?

00:11:44.665 --> 00:11:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I think
unfortunately,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:84%
there was not much of that
I ever observed when I was

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:90%
in the military.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we ever
got too much of that.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:84%
In my later years, I would
say in the last decade or so,

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
as I have communicated
with special section

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
personnel and special section
medical personnel, just

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:84%
to continue to sort out
any of the leftover stuff

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
that I've got to deal with in
my own body and my own brain

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:90%
from all of that.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And their tools continue
to be advancing.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.200 align:middle line:84%
From whatever they were
doing 20 years ago,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.245 align:middle line:84%
is continuing to
advance and develop.

00:12:20.245 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And I will say that
through a couple

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:84%
of experimental
procedures to work

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:29.010 align:middle line:84%
on some emotional, mental,
spiritual, psychological

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:84%
healing, I'm a
human being again,

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.630 align:middle line:90%
which is no small statement.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.770 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:90%
There are tools which they use.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But I would say
that when you start

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:84%
talking about emotional healing
tools, psychological healing

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.350 align:middle line:84%
tools, you're talking about
things that are less--

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:90%
there are less mechanical--

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: --less like this
part goes into this part goes

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:90%
into this part.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And more essence of mind
inside the bowl of the brain.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I was going to I say
it's like etheric tuning

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.520 align:middle line:90%
of some sorts of--

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:90%
It's trickier.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:90%
But they're getting good at it.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they're certainly able
to do some pretty amazing stuff

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.230 align:middle line:90%
with that subtlety.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.135 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What was the last
time you experienced advanced ET

00:13:15.135 --> 00:13:15.935 align:middle line:90%
tech?

00:13:15.935 --> 00:13:18.725 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Probably about four,
maybe five months ago tops.

00:13:18.725 --> 00:13:20.525 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: And what was that?

00:13:20.525 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Actually, my partner
and I both needed to get some

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:90%
work done.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Some healing work done
that we were wanting

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:84%
to get some next-level work done
and it was recommended to us

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
to go to this contracting--
medical contracting

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:84%
agency that's
extraterrestrial in origin.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
To ask them if they
would do the work.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:90%
And it was phenomenal.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What was the tech and
technologies involved with you

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.790 align:middle line:90%
two?

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I couldn't say much
more than they took us aboard

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:84%
their vehicle, their
ship, and did some work.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:84%
They experienced time
moving at a different rate.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.930 align:middle line:90%
And we were there for a while.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just like hours.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.460 align:middle line:84%
It was I think several
days of treatment.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And then so when
we came back, there

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:84%
was just this feeling
of being really

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.955 align:middle line:84%
temporally discombobulated for
about a day, day and a half.

00:14:10.955 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Randy, who
were these beings?

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.788 align:middle line:90%
And how did you contact them?

00:14:13.788 --> 00:14:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: These
are the Velodians.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The Velodians are-- think of
them like doctors and nurses--

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:84%
an entire planet of doctors,
nurses, and medical texts.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.340 align:middle line:90%
It's really what they live for.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So they have contractors
that go out to--

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
like "Red Cross" workers
out into the field.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And so there were some
stationed here just in case

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:90%
they're needed here.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it was recommended
by our personnel

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:84%
to contact them so that we could
do it separate from in-house

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:90%
for reasons I want to go into.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:84%
That it was wise at that
moment to do something

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:90%
that was not in-house.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.462 align:middle line:90%
And so we asked them to do it.

00:14:53.462 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And they took us
aboard their ship.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Did some work.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And we were in way
better shape afterwards.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, whatever they did was--

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So Randy, how were
you actually contacted by them,

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:84%
or how did you
reach out for help?

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Our personnel
recommended that we reach out

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So we reached out to them
psionically to communicate,

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:90%
which there's a protocol for.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And then after talking
to them for a few minutes

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:84%
about what was going on and
what we would like them to do

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and they agreed and then
took us on their ship

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.475 align:middle line:90%
and sorted us out.

00:15:26.475 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:90%
But it took several days.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.463 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what were the
benefits after you returned.

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:33.970 align:middle line:84%
You were discombobulated, you
said for a day and a half,

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:90%
and then--

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What
were the benefits?

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.415 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us why
you were being treated?

00:15:38.415 --> 00:15:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: No.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is before
treatment, everything bad.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.375 align:middle line:84%
After treatment,
everything good.

00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: For the body, physical
or for just everything around

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:90%
you?

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Oh, it was not just
a physical-- it was a physical,

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:90%
emotional, like psychological.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a
totality of the work

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
in my own personal experience
that seemed to take place.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to really just
try and put some perspective

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:84%
on Velodian medical technology,
think of the most advanced

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Terran medical
technology that you can,

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.625 align:middle line:84%
and then that's still the
dark ages compared to whatever

00:16:21.625 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:90%
they've got going on.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Just because it's what
they eat, drink, sleep,

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and breathe every day
on their entire planet.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.450 align:middle line:84%
They're a planet
of medical workers.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, does the Earth
defense force utilize these

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:90%
advanced healing technologies?

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just for the
extraterrestrials?

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: We use technologies
that we have adapted, utilized,

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and that we have
come to understand.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
I think as we come to
understand more technology,

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:84%
you know, of course, we're
allies with the Velodian.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.322 align:middle line:84%
So they're certainly
the first thing

00:16:53.322 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
to want to do is

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
share that technology
with us and go, oh.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:84%
You guys need better
medical technology here.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.160 align:middle line:84%
You should send some people
to our medical universities

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.496 align:middle line:84%
so that they can become super
skilled medical professionals

00:17:05.496 --> 00:17:07.329 align:middle line:84%
and then teach you how
all this stuff works.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure we have a few
people who are doing that.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.680 align:middle line:84%
But that's still an exchange
of information and technology

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.480 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So who knows how long
it's going to take

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:middle line:84%
before we're half as
good as their emergency

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:90%
medical technicians are?

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Where do the
Velodian come from?

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.274 align:middle line:84%
And how are they
allowed to work here?

00:17:26.274 --> 00:17:29.320 align:middle line:10%
>> CRAMER: I believe
from the Sirius System.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:90%
I believe Velod--

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.835 align:middle line:84%
Velod, I believe is how they
say the name of the planet

00:17:33.835 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:90%
is Velod.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Is a planet inside
the Sirius System.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:90%
That's where they come from.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
They are medical
contractors who--

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle line:84%
again, like Red Cross workers,
volunteer their personnel

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.645 align:middle line:84%
to the Galactic Senate and
say, hey, where can we go help?

00:17:52.645 --> 00:17:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Where can we send some "Red
Cross" workers to help out?

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.550 align:middle line:84%
To be available in case there's
an emergency or in case someone

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:90%
needs something.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So they just make
themselves available

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and show up and are
in the neighborhood

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.912 align:middle line:84%
waiting for someone to say,
"Hey, give me a hand here."

00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And so they were just
kind of hanging out

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.780 align:middle line:84%
in the solar system waiting
for somebody to ask them

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:90%
for assistance.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were super
eager to help out.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So like our Red
Cross, which goes to multiple

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:84%
countries and serves
multiple races,

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:84%
how about the Velodians or just
other extraterrestrial healing

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:27.880 align:middle line:90%
tech?

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Is it specific for
one race or can

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:90%
it do multiple physiologies?

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Oh, my understanding,
the Velodian seem really good

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:84%
at any physiology
anywhere, anyhow, anytime.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it would be--

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:84%
it would probably be a real
surprise or shock to them

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.150 align:middle line:84%
if you brought them
an injured patient

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.015 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't know what to do.

00:18:49.015 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If we have advanced
medical technologies,

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.190 align:middle line:84%
why are they being
suppressed to the militaries,

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:84%
our civilian hospitals, why
can't we just go out and get

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.210 align:middle line:90%
this stuff?

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Again, it's treaties.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And right now we
have not entered

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:84%
into a state where
ETs can declare

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
a medical emergency
or a civil emergency

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:90%
and simply start showing up.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:84%
If conditions could arise
in which they could declare

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:84%
a civic emergency based on
whatever those criteria are,

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.110 align:middle line:84%
then we could see
the planet flooded

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrial EMTs.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But until that happens, until
that criteria could be crossed,

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:84%
which we haven't
reached yet, they all

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:84%
have to stand off at
the sidelines and wait.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.770 align:middle line:90%
And go, OK.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:84%
We're waiting for someone to
tell us that we can go help

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.708 align:middle line:90%
or asking us to go help.

00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:51.125 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we have to wait on
this side of the sidelines--

00:19:51.125 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who is
that someone, Randy?

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Because all this war and
people dying in war here

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth, all
the disease and cancers,

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
all this could be easily avoided
with all this technology.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So who are they
waiting for that call?

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.660 align:middle line:90%
You said they're waiting for--

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a difficult
pin to put in other

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:84%
than to say that there
are some people still

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:22.690 align:middle line:84%
who are very much at the top
of leadership in this world who

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.818 align:middle line:84%
are not yet allowing
that to occur.

00:20:26.818 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:10%
There are plenty of
other people that

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.970 align:middle line:10%
are encouraging it
to occur, including

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.270 align:middle line:10%
the medical personnel, who
are waiting on the sidelines.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.647 align:middle line:84%
You can let us help now,
you can let us help now.

00:20:36.647 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:84%
We'd be happy to come
in and help right now.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, well, not yet.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So like, unfortunately, if
this was all about logic

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and sanity, this would
not be a problem.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Logic and sanity are
pretty straightforward.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you need to
ask someone, what's

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.200 align:middle line:84%
the most sane logical
thing to do here,

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:84%
it's not hard to come up
with what the answer is

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.310 align:middle line:84%
for what is the most
sane healthy thing to do,

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:90%
logical thing to do.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:08.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not difficult.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:84%
But because we're
not, as a species,

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:20.230 align:middle line:84%
prone to pure logic and clarity,
and because we're so confused

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:27.850 align:middle line:84%
with emotion and preferences
and favoritism or disfavoritism,

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:90%
then it's complicated.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:84%
If it was just about
simplicity, logic, clarity,

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.520 align:middle line:90%
this would all be done.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:84%
But because it's not and
because the people who

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:84%
are involved in
making those decisions

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:84%
are simply not logical
clear-minded people,

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:84%
they have really intense
feelings about things.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And most of those feelings
are fear and insecurity.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And if they change
something in their universe

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
something that

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:84%
makes them more afraid
or more insecure,

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:90%
then they're not going to do it.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So there are people
who know what

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
the logical smart thing
to do is, and they're not

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:84%
going to do it because they're
afraid and they're insecure.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want to do
the logical clear thing

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and the smart thing
because they want

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:84%
to do the thing that
keeps them from enacting

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.630 align:middle line:84%
some horrible unknown, fear
that probably isn't going

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:84%
to be as awful as they think
it is when it actually happens.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.630 align:middle line:84%
But again, if it were just
about logic and smarts,

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:90%
we'd be through this already.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
there are plenty

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
of people in this world
who are not logical

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:90%
and they're not smart.

They're emotional and they're
vindictive and they're selfish.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And in some cases, they're lazy.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.270 align:middle line:10%
And in some cases,
they're just hateful

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:10%
or spiteful or disdainful
or any of the other words

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.460 align:middle line:10%
that make people all the
things that aren't just

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:10%
smart and logical.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What positive pathways
do you see moving forward

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.885 align:middle line:84%
knowing about all these advanced
healing technologies and how

00:23:00.885 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
soon do you think
they'll be out?

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: You know, again, I
think because we still have all

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:84%
the evidence and reason to think
that we are on a footing to be

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.800 align:middle line:84%
invaded by alien forces sometime
here in the near future,

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:84%
we believe very strongly that
any opportunity for disclosure,

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
any opportunity for change is
an opportunity for intervention.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're just waiting
for the opportunity

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.250 align:middle line:84%
when intervening can
happen without saying,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.380 align:middle line:90%
can we intervene?

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:90%
Can we intervene?

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Instead of having to say
that, we can just go, oh, now,

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:90%
we have to.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Here we're intervening
and then no one's

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:84%
going to complain about it,
because we absolutely had to.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But as long as there's an
argument that we don't have to,

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:84%
then it's difficult to
justify making that move,

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:84%
again, when people
are still just

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
very scared, afraid, and
insecure about the things

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.040 align:middle line:90%
that they may lose.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to get
over that pretty soon.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Pretty soon.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Very well put, Randy.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Looking forward to that.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Thank you, again,
for being on the show, Randy.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Thanks for having me.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:16.275 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:24:16.275 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: My name
is Emery Smith.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.570 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
