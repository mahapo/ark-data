>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.010 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty, a
retired counterintelligence

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.290 align:middle line:10%
agent who served in
the Air Force office

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately involved
with UFO ET-related content.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.350 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD C. DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.685 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Nellis Test
and Training Range

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:38.290 align:middle line:10%
is part of Tonopah Air
Force Base in Nevada.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:10%
It's been reported that there
was a UFO base located there.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
What was a UFO base doing within
the parameters of an American

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Air Force base?

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, go
back a little bit.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Tonopah Air Force Base is within
the Nellis Test and Training

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Range with Area 51 and
including the Nevada Test Site,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:84%
which is now the Nevada
National Security Site.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:84%
We located a UFO base
at Urania mountain,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
which is in the western portion
of Nellis Test and Training

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Range, which was on
Tonopah Air Force Base.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And we found this
when two women--

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:84%
in 1983-- had contacts with
an extraterrestrial race.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what did this
contact with these two women

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
this Air Force base?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Let me go back
and tell you that story.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Two women driving on
Nevada Route 6, which

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:84%
is north of Nellis Test
and Training Range, west

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:84%
of Warm Springs,
Nevada, were driving

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.400 align:middle line:84%
in a September day in 1983
when they saw a spacecraft.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.920 align:middle line:84%
They referred to
it as spacecraft.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
The craft landed,
they were contacted,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:90%
and they had missing time.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.330 align:middle line:84%
They reported this to Nevada
law enforcement authorities--

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Nevada Highway Patrol and the
Nye County Sheriff's Office.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Nye County Sheriff's
and the state patrol--

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:84%
the Highway Patrol
notified Tonopah Air Force

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Base, the security
police desk sergeant,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and reported that
these two females had

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.020 align:middle line:84%
seen some kind of a craft,
and they were afraid

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
that they might
have been abducted.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Immediately the security
police desk sergeant

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
notified Air Force Office
of Special Investigation.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I, at the time,
was at Groom Lake,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:90%
which is about 80 miles away.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:90%
I was notified of it.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Myself and another
agent then traveled up,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
and it took a couple hours
to get to Tonopah, and then--

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
to Tonopah, Nevada,
not the air base.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.415 align:middle line:84%
There's a Tonopah, Nevada about
40 miles outside Tonopah air

00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:90%
base.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And we met up with
these two females,

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.610 align:middle line:90%
and they told us this story.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Told us that they were
traveling, they saw this craft.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:90%
The craft landed.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
They had a contact,
they had missing time,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and they were afraid
that they might

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:90%
have been exposed to radiation.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.760 align:middle line:90%
That was their danger.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And that was what they told
the Nevada law enforcement

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.800 align:middle line:90%
authorities.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
We transported these two
females to Nellis Air Force Base

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:84%
hospital, where they were
examined by military doctors.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
They were not exposed
to any radiation,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
but they did have strange
marks on their bodies.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So with their consent, we did
a hypnotic interview of them.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And during this
hypnotic interview,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:84%
they explained to us that
they were transported

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
to this huge facility
in a desert location

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in Nevada.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:84%
How they explained it to
us-- it was a complex way

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
we were examining--
interrogating them.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And we weren't
interviewing them,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:84%
we were actually
interrogating them

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:84%
because under hypnosis,
you can be more forceful.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And we were more forceful.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And they gave us details of
a mountain that we knew--

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.550 align:middle line:84%
because we were familiar
with Nellis Test and Training

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:90%
Range--

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
was in fact Urania mountain,
which is in the Cactus mountain

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:84%
chain of western part of the
Nellis Test and Training Range.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
These females,
during the interview,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
described these beings in
clear terminology to them.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
They were hideous looking.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:90%
They had large noses.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.830 align:middle line:84%
They referred to the
noses as elephant noses.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:90%
And they were tall, very tall.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't feel harmed.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:90%
They weren't hostile.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
They kept reassuring
them in some voice--

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:84%
they didn't describe it
as telepathy or anything.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:84%
They heard voices telling them,
we're not here to hurt you.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to harm you.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.170 align:middle line:90%
But they were in a facility.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And listening to what they
told us as far as the facility,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
it was a big opening facility,
they explained to us,

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and there was some
beings walking around.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And there were rooms.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:90%
But they were not in the room.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:90%
They were in an open area.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
But they were on a table,
and they couldn't move.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.515 align:middle line:84%
So then we started
an investigation.

00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And one of the parts of
the investigation, we

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
flew over the area some
days later in a helicopter.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And the first flight over the
area, we didn't see anything.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:90%
We just saw the mountain.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
There were some
testing facilities east

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
of the mountain range, but
we didn't see anything else.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.440 align:middle line:84%
But as the helicopter
banked to the west--

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and I asked the pilot, let's
make one more pass around it,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
but this time, let's go right
over the top of the mountain.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:84%
When we went over the
top of the mountain,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:90%
the mountain had been--

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:90%
was open.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
We could see down
into the mountain.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:90%
I said, my god, look at this.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And the other agent on
board the helicopter

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:90%
said, that mountain just opened.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Because before, it wasn't
open when we flew over it

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:90%
15 or 20 minutes earlier.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does the opening--
like a mile, two miles, or?

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I would say the opening
was probably at least a mile.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know we
had the technology

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:84%
to do that, number one, and
I thought it was our base.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I tell the
helicopter pilot, hey, let's

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
get a little bit lower
to look at this--

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what kind of base
they have down there.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of S-4, and
I'm thinking of Papoose.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And he was a little reluctant to
do that, because he didn't know

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:90%
was down there either.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I'll get
as close as I feel safe.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.807 align:middle line:84%
Because he's a pilot, so he's
in control of the aircraft.

00:06:56.807 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So we got a little
lower, and we could

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.560 align:middle line:84%
see the distinct
structures down there.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
There were, like, buildings
inside here, little buildings

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:90%
all around.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
There were probably a dozen
of these little buildings.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.960 align:middle line:84%
They appeared to be rectangle
or square structures.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have any--

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:90%
a peaked roof or roofs on it.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
There were some reflective--
something reflective coming up.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:84%
We could see-- the
area was lit up,

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:90%
so there was lights down there.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle line:84%
They were around the
edge of the mountain,

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:90%
inside this hollowed mountain.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And then in the center
area, it was all open.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And there was something
in that center area

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that from our altitude,
I couldn't make out.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.740 align:middle line:84%
But we figured, when I started
thinking about it more,

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that was the alien craft that
these two women had contact

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:84%
That mountain opened and that's
where that craft went and hid.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:90%
So we flew back to Tonopah.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:90%
We landed at Tonopah.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.255 align:middle line:84%
Immediately we went to the
base commander's office.

00:07:57.255 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And we asked the base
commander, what's

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:90%
going on Urania mountain?

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, what are
you talking about?

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you have anything
that you can tell us

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.020 align:middle line:90%
about Urania mountain?

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
I said, is that no because we're
not cleared, or no because you

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:90%
don't know?

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.440 align:middle line:90%
He got very upset with us.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, here we are,
special agents--

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.970 align:middle line:84%
we're federal agents--
and he's a full bird

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:90%
colonel in the Air Force.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And you understand the
mentality a full bird

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.020 align:middle line:90%
colonel had-- this is my base.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask me questions
about my base.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The fact he got
upset already red-flagged it.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.919 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
we need to know,

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:84%
because something
happened out here.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:90%
And then we briefed him on it.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm not at liberty
to discuss it any further.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:90%
You guys can leave my office.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:90%
So we said, thank you, sir.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:90%
And we left his office.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Then we immediately responded
by sending a teletype--

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:90%
the old teletype system--

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:90%
up our chain of command.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we need to know
what's going on out there.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:90%
And we need to get permission.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.755 align:middle line:84%
Now, he worked for a
numbered Air Force commander

00:09:03.755 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:90%
at Edwards Air Force Base.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.002 align:middle line:84%
So we thought, well,
we'll go to him--

00:09:08.002 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
he was general, one-star
general, brigadier general--

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and we'll ask him to let
that commander give us

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:90%
permission to find out.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:84%
When we went to the general
at Edwards Air Force Base--

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Uh-oh.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --he didn't
know anything about it.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
As far as I know, there's
nothing going on out there.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.150 align:middle line:90%
So then he went to the KY-3--

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
it's a secure phone; you
can talk classified up

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:90%
to top secret over it.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:90%
He calls him.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.858 align:middle line:84%
He said, what's going
on at Urania mountain?

00:09:36.858 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And the colonel tells
the general, General,

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, the general
says, you can't tell me

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:84%
because you don't know,
or you can't tell me

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not briefed?

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.040 align:middle line:84%
He said, General, I
just can't tell you.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, that upset the general.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, he's a one-star general.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So he tells me, he says, I'm
going to get you the security

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:84%
clearance you need,
because I'm about

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
ready to relieve that colonel
of his command out there.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:90%
So he made some phone calls.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:84%
We left and went
back to Groom Lake.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:84%
We'd been on a plane,
a T-39 we'd flown.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:90%
And that was late afternoon.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.460 align:middle line:90%
And I get a call from my boss.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And my boss tells me, you go up
to see the colonel at Tonopah.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:90%
He's going to brief you.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.512 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So it was too
late in that afternoon.

00:10:33.512 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:90%
We waited the next day.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:90%
We went up there.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.470 align:middle line:90%
He sits down with us.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:90%
He's red-faced.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:90%
You know he's upset.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:84%
You know he doesn't
want to do this.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You went over his head.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Right.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Went over his head.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I said, sir, I'm sorry that
I had to do that, but--

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:84%
he said, you should have came
back to me and asked me again.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I said, you said, get out
of my office, and we did.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's something
going on down there

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, what are
you talking about?

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle line:84%
He said, listen, it's
beyond our capability.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:90%
You want to go down there?

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.142 align:middle line:84%
You go down there, but you
better take a gun with you.

00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, I always carried--

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.635 align:middle line:90%
we had a--

00:11:13.635 --> 00:11:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I carried a 45, a
special 45 that OSI had.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:90%
I said--

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I was surprised they
allowed you to fly over that

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
secured area, because I thought
that was part of Tonopah--

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.140 align:middle line:90%
that mountain.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It is Tonopah.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't know we
were flying over it.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.028 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He was unaware
that we'd flown over it.

00:11:31.028 --> 00:11:33.546 align:middle line:90%
We got a special mission--

00:11:33.546 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:84%
a Lieutenant, only I think,
I think first lieutenant,

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.940 align:middle line:90%
got us a mission.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:84%
We OSI, we need to do this,
you've got a helicopter.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Go for it.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.157 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, you've
got a HH-3, we flew.

00:11:47.157 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, what
are you talking about,

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.040 align:middle line:90%
we going to need a gun?

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.410 align:middle line:84%
What, is there
animals down there?

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Or what is down there?

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:84%
What kind of gun do
you need us to take?

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:90%
He said, an M16.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why would we want
to take an M16 down there?

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:84%
He said, you'll find
out when you get there.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I said, you can't give us any
more information than that?

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:90%
He says, I don't know.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that he was sincere
there, that he didn't know.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.460 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, who
would we find--

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:90%
who would we talk to?

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.693 align:middle line:84%
So he said, well, the
chief of security police.

00:12:18.693 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the chief
of security police, who

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:90%
was at the time a major.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the major, I said,
we want to go down to Urania.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, I need to send some
troops down there with you.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:90%
What's going on down there?

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:90%
He said, we really don't know.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, you want to tell
me in straight words what

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about?

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
He said-- he looked
around the room,

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:84%
he said, let's go
into the other room.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:90%
So we went in the back room.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.010 align:middle line:90%
It was like a supply room.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
He sat down and he
looked down on the floor,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:90%
and he kind of looked around.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there's aliens
living in that mountain.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:90%
I said, extraterrestrial aliens?

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's why
the mountain opens?

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Shakes his head.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, so what are we going
to find when we go down there?

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.910 align:middle line:84%
He said, we only went down there
once, and we never went back.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:90%
So I said, you went down there--

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:90%
you climbed the mountain?

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, no, no, no.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:90%
There's a tunnel.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:84%
The old uranium mine
is there, and there's

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.820 align:middle line:84%
a tunnel that leaves--
by the old mine shaft.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:90%
We had built that--

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:84%
the test site built
that for a testing area.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
test lasers in it.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And when they got a certain
point into the mountain,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.780 align:middle line:84%
about a mile in, they realized
there were visitors there--

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
he's telling us--

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.280 align:middle line:90%
so we got out of there.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So I said, the United States
Air Force and United States Army

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:84%
is pulling out of a
place that you saying--

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:90%
now, did you actually see them?

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, I never saw them.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I want
to go down there.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So I got a couple
of agents, and there

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.850 align:middle line:84%
was a security detail
of 12 to 15 of them,

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.860 align:middle line:90%
I believe, security police.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:90%
And they were armed.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't take an M16.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:90%
We didn't take it.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:84%
We had them and I was trained
in them, but I didn't take them.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:90%
I had my handgun.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, plus
you had the whole crew.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, plus-- those
guys are going to protect us,

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:90%
at least I hope.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
We went down there,
we walked in.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we went in.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And they had erected a
huge vault door because

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.510 align:middle line:90%
of what they found inside.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And there was combination
locks and so forth,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and it took some time for it
to get the big vault door open.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And the security
guys go, there it is.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.967 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you
guys going in with us?

00:14:37.967 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of
looked at each other.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
It was a lieutenant that
was the leader of them.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.483 align:middle line:90%
If you insist.

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, have you
been here before?

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:90%
I said, have you seen anything?

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:90%
He shakes his head, yeah.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, are they
extraterrestrials?

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.010 align:middle line:90%
What do they look like?

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, they're
pretty hideous looking.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, did you shoot them?

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:84%
They never fired at us,
we never fired at them.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:90%
We just got out of there.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.205 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
like a movie plot.

00:15:03.205 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, yeah.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.077 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I'm saying--

00:15:05.077 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at my agent and
I don't believe any of that.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I really seriously
don't believe it.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I think there was--
my thinking was,

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.630 align:middle line:84%
there's something
else down there

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.290 align:middle line:90%
that they want to scare us away.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Form of disinformation that
they were trying to pull on us.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right, that's
what I would think.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I'm
saying, you know what?

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I actually think you
guys know what's there--

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.290 align:middle line:84%
some kind of secret facility,
training facility or research

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.840 align:middle line:84%
facility, and you just don't
want us to know about it.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, no,
no, no, no, no, sir.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.595 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you.

00:15:37.595 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, let's go.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I want to see these
aliens myself.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
lights in this tunnel.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Once we got beyond
the door, it was dark.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
The only light I could
see was light coming out

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:84%
of the tunnel area,
or the opening

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.680 align:middle line:84%
that was in front of us, which
was probably another 75 yards

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.060 align:middle line:90%
in front of us.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.380 align:middle line:84%
As we kept walking forward,
I had a flashlight on,

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:84%
the agent next to me
had a flashlight on,

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was lights behind us
from the security police.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
As we get closer,
we see a light.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.760 align:middle line:84%
We see that something's
illuminated in there.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.020 align:middle line:90%
And we hear this humming sound.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the lieutenant,
I said, what's that?

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:90%
What's that sound?

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.983 align:middle line:90%
Is that some kind of experiment?

00:16:18.983 --> 00:16:20.500 align:middle line:90%
He said, I don't know.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.348 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, sir, I'm
telling you, I don't know.

00:16:23.348 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So we get closer and closer
and closer and closer

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.110 align:middle line:90%
and closer and closer.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And I realize something's
going on in here.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.550 align:middle line:84%
The security force
stayed their ground.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And they said-- they looked
at it and said to me,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.120 align:middle line:84%
we got your back, but we're
not going to go any farther.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.360 align:middle line:84%
As I got close to the
opening, this being

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.820 align:middle line:84%
appeared, as if he
walked around a corner.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:84%
What I could see
from that angle--

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
it was that position and I'm
about 50 yards from the being--

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:90%
it was tall.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Over six foot tall.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Had a very large expenditure
coming out of its face,

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:84%
similar to what the ladies
described as an elephant nose.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.400 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't as long as
the elephant nose.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.109 align:middle line:90%
It came out.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't sure if it was some
kind of a breathing apparatus

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.390 align:middle line:90%
that was placed over their face.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see the
eyes because the being

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.300 align:middle line:90%
is silhouetted in the light.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:90%
I had a flashlight.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Flashlight wasn't that strong.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't totally
illuminate the being.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Had very long arms,
probably went down to its--

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:90%
what I would call its knees.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Had very long fingers.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It appeared to me to
be reptilian looking.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Had a very long,
distorted face, almost as

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:84%
if the being had pock marks
or something else on its face.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:90%
And I thought about this later.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
The being might have had
some kind of facial mask on,

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.132 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
the appendage was.

00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sounds like it, yes.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah,
because it might not

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.810 align:middle line:84%
be able to breathe our
atmosphere, or maybe too

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:90%
much oxygen or not enough.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Didn't have any ears
that I could see.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm
looking at it, and I'm

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:90%
shining a flashlight on it.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.360 align:middle line:90%
At that point, I felt--

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:84%
discretion's the
better part of valor.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.010 align:middle line:90%
I never drew my weapon.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.520 align:middle line:84%
The agent next to me, he
had more combat experience

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:90%
in Vietnam.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:90%
He was a Vietnam vet.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.050 align:middle line:84%
He did pull his weapon, but
he had it down to his side.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How was he
responding to this encounter?

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He said to me, we've
got to be careful of it.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
He was calm, but he said, we've
got to be careful of that.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm not sure if
that's just a human dressed up

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:90%
in a suit.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:90%
He said, you're nuts.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's no human
dressed up in a suit.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know this at the time,
but he saw other beings behind,

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:90%
farther away.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.267 align:middle line:84%
Because he's at a
different angle.

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:90%
He's over here.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.320 align:middle line:84%
He's probably three or
four feet away from me.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't say that to me at
the time, but later he told me.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So then I decided,
let's just get out.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's just retreat
back to the vault door.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there any
communication or sounds going

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:90%
on that you could hear?

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Was there any movement
with the being

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.240 align:middle line:90%
to show any type of force?

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: When I moved forward,
the being moved forward.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:90%
When I stopped, it stopped.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see it have
any weapons in its hand.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see any
weapons anywhere else.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hear or
detect any voices.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't as if it was trying
to communicate with me.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hear
anything in my mind.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.970 align:middle line:84%
We continued hearing
the humming sound.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to move--

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.420 align:middle line:90%
I didn't move any closer.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I backed up a couple steps.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:90%
It didn't move.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And I turned around
and went back.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you casually
turn around and walk away?

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Or was everyone running?

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Or any chaos going on
there with the crew?

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:18.092 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We casually-- my
partner, Steve, he looked--

00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:90%
he continued looking forward.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, he's
a combat veteran.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:84%
This guy had been
in Vietnam, not me.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.400 align:middle line:90%
But he was in Vietnam.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:90%
He'd engaged enemies.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
He was more
combat-oriented than I

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:84%
was, although I had
a lot of training,

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.580 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't have
that type of training.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:90%
I turned around.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I turned my back on the being.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:90%
He didn't.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:90%
He walked backwards.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw him
walking backwards,

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:50.920 align:middle line:84%
then I turned to my left,
and then I realized,

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle line:90%
I better keep an eye.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.590 align:middle line:84%
All the time we were moving
back another 50 yards

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:84%
to the vault door, and at
no time did that being move.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle line:90%
The being stood its ground.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:84%
The being never made any
hostile gestures towards us.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.655 align:middle line:84%
Its arms are continually
down at its side.

00:21:09.655 --> 00:21:12.280 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:90%
The being never moved.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And then we shut the vault
door, and that was it.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So then I went back to the base
and I talked to the commander.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, he
said, did you see what--

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I said, ETs have penetrated
a United States Air Force

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.928 align:middle line:84%
base, the most
secret base on Earth,

00:21:32.928 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and you guys didn't
hear anything about it?

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.446 align:middle line:90%
He said, we're working on it.

00:21:36.446 --> 00:21:37.465 align:middle line:90%
I said, you got a plan?

00:21:37.465 --> 00:21:39.536 align:middle line:90%
He said, we got a plan.

00:21:39.536 --> 00:21:40.853 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's the plan?

00:21:40.853 --> 00:21:43.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, we got to
coordinate with the highest

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:43.950 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.570 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, what's your plan?

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, once we get
the plan, we'll let you know.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:84%
So I went back and
I did a long report.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, pages of report.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:90%
And I sent the report up.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And I figured a couple
days, they'd respond back.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I think we got back at
6/7 o'clock at night,

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I did a report, sent it up.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I went back to the dorm and
came into office about 6:00

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And we had a security
policeman in there

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.050 align:middle line:90%
that guards the facility.

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, sir, you
Special Agent Doty?

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:84%
He said, you need to call this
number as soon as possible.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the number and it
was a autovon secure number,

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.680 align:middle line:90%
DNN number--

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.970 align:middle line:90%
DSN number.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So I went in the KY,
called up, and it

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:84%
was Colonel Law, who
was the commander

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:90%
of counterintelligence for OSI.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, you need to fly
to Washington tomorrow.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.365 align:middle line:84%
He said, I got a
special mission aircraft

00:22:48.365 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:84%
at Nellis that's
going to fly you

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and this other special
agent to Washington.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: A special
mission aircraft.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Special mission
aircraft, and that's

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:90%
really unheard of.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, presidential
support details,

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:06.460 align:middle line:84%
when we're in DEFCON 2, or
something like that-- maybe.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.263 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I said, OK,
we'll be at Nellis.

00:23:09.263 --> 00:23:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So I got the other
agent and we went out

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:12.090 align:middle line:90%
to Nellis the next day.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.810 align:middle line:84%
They flew-- I mean, actually it
was that afternoon-- flew us.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.870 align:middle line:84%
We got to Washington--
landed at Andrews,

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:84%
went to our OSI
headquarters at Bolling,

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.630 align:middle line:90%
and went into the secure room.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And the colonel says, we got
a major problem out there.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, is it
something I did, sir?

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of scared
that he's going

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.820 align:middle line:90%
to chew my butt for something.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:90%
I was so persistent.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:90%
You did everything right.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.900 align:middle line:90%
He said, they've hid it on us.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Nobody up here knew about it.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:49.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, nobody within
headquarters staff,

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Air Force headquarters,
Pentagon, knew about it.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Secretary of the Air Force
didn't know about it,

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
the secretary of Defense
didn't know about it.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They keep it
very compartmentalized,

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and people don't realize that
a lot of these heads of state

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and people, even the
president, might not

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:84%
know about things like this
that are going on out there.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Plausible deniability,
I think it would be.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I can't believe--

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.380 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.963 align:middle line:84%
He said, I couldn't
believe it either,

00:24:20.963 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:84%
but I started asking
questions, and I

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:84%
had to go over and brief
the secretary of Defense.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.290 align:middle line:10%
He was outraged--
Caspar Weinberger.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.250 align:middle line:10%
What?

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:10%
He didn't believe any of it.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:84%
He said, you guys
are making this up?

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Is this part of a war game?

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Is this part of some kind
of psychological game?

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:90%
No, we've got proof of it.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:90%
We saw it.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:90%
So then the ball kept rolling.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And we briefed-- I briefed
a couple other people,

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.310 align:middle line:90%
a group of people.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And we went back, and
a short time later, we

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:84%
were told that it was
going to be taken care of.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And I kept asking
the question, how is

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.970 align:middle line:90%
it going to be taken care of?

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
He said, we're going
to take care of it.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.110 align:middle line:84%
We've got nuclear weapons
at Nevada Test Site.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use that facility
as a testing of a weapons

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:11.932 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:25:11.932 --> 00:25:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So did you know
and follow up on that?

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.793 align:middle line:84%
Or was that the last briefing
that you received on that?

00:25:16.793 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That was
the last briefing

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I received, although they had a
test in Nevada Test Site, Area

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:84%
20, which is in the northwest
portion of the Nevada Test

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Site.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And they claimed
that the detonation

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:84%
of this normal, routine, nuclear
weapon that they were testing

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.100 align:middle line:90%
was going to occur at--

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:84%
there, but in actuality, it
occurred at Urania mountain.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.390 align:middle line:90%
They did it all at Urania.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:43.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't know--

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't ever privy
into how they did it,

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
how they dropped it, how
they placed it in there.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.962 align:middle line:84%
But it had to have been some
team of people, soldiers

00:25:50.962 --> 00:25:52.170 align:middle line:90%
or something, that got it in.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:52.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:90%
I was never briefed on it.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I just know that the explosion
occurred, because we could

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:90%
feel it to where we were at.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think there
was any repercussions for us

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:84%
blowing that mountain up with
the extraterrestrial base

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:90%
and craft there?

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever hear of anything
negative that came back on us

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.570 align:middle line:90%
because we did this?

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:84%
But that would be something
that would be still

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.730 align:middle line:90%
probably classified.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:26.240 align:middle line:84%
There was a couple
incidents that we felt,

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.510 align:middle line:84%
we OSI felt was
repercussions for it.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Although the government--
the Air Force

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.260 align:middle line:84%
itself never
readily admitted it.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:84%
But there was some
incidents happened,

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:41.810 align:middle line:84%
bodies found, things happened,
our facility is destroyed.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.090 align:middle line:84%
We had a-- without
going into great detail,

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:84%
we had a very, very, very
expensive facility, millions

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and millions of dollars,
that was located

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.480 align:middle line:84%
in a remote area of
Tonopah, and that

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.130 align:middle line:84%
was destroyed months after
we destroyed that mountain.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know for a fact
that it was retaliation,

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.718 align:middle line:84%
but I think the government--
and we figured it was.

00:27:04.718 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
the assassination

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.093 align:middle line:84%
that happened with the
portal that opened up

00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:90%
during the important meeting?

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And a being came
through and pretty much

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:84%
leveled all the
officials in the room

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:84%
except for a few
and the two security

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:18.385 align:middle line:90%
guards that were outside?

00:27:18.385 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That
happened at Bolling,

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.360 align:middle line:84%
a very secure facility,
hardened facility,

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:90%
wasn't easy to penetrate it.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.870 align:middle line:90%
It was underground.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Security police guarded it.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:84%
There was a high level meeting
occurring inside the room.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Some of the same
people that had been

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:84%
involved in decision-making
regarding Urania

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:90%
was in that room.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And a portal opened, a
witness, the survivors told us,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and a hideous looking
being-- although I

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:84%
don't know that they ever fully
described it-- had a light.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:90%
It was all lit up.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And it harmed a
lot of the people--

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:00.590 align:middle line:84%
killed some and harmed
others in that room.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:90%
So a connection between the two?

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Probably.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell me if the colonel
or general was in that room

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.990 align:middle line:90%
when that happened?

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: One of them was.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes, one of them was.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Once again,
Rick, thank you

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.160 align:middle line:84%
so much for sharing
these amazing stories.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
being on the show.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.492 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Thank you, Emery.

00:28:24.492 --> 00:28:26.200 align:middle line:84%
