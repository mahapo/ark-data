>>DAVID WILCOCK: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure".

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.730 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.550 align:middle line:10%
We are here with our
guest Emery Smith.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.170 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
we're going to talk

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:84%
about what it is like to have
a day in the life on a highly

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.787 align:middle line:90%
classified underground base.

00:00:33.787 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back to the show.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Hey, Dave.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We've
talked in some length

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:84%
now about your
autopsy experiences.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.560 align:middle line:84%
We've kind of had
an overview of that.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So I think you're painting,
now, a very intriguing picture.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And it would be hard to
spend some time in that world

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:90%
and then leave that world.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Was there ever a time that
you got to stay in that world,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that you actually stayed
overnight at the base?

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, yes.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:10%
Many times I had to stay
the night in the base,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:10%
I think maybe up to 60
times, actually, total.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.069 align:middle line:90%
And the reason for that depends.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
reasons why you would have

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:90%
to spend the night in a base.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
They go on lockdown sometimes
when you're working there.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And you might not know
why it's a lockdown.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:84%
But you're there, they
close the hatches,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and now you're going to be
spending an additional amount

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:84%
of time there other
than your work duty time

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:84%
that you do get paid for, by
the way, long as you're there.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And they have
facilities there that

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:84%
are very nice, that you can
stay the night, like barracks

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot, your own
room, your own lavatory,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.660 align:middle line:84%
little even social areas where
other people can also live.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:84%
The base, you could actually
live there indefinitely.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And then getting back to
why a lockdown would happen,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:84%
there could have
been a breach somehow

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
into the base from an other
known contractor or other known

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:84%
entity, and everything gets
locked down for a while.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And I do recall one time there
was a huge explosion that I

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:84%
could actually
feel this vibration

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:90%
of this electromagnetic weapon.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know where it came
from, but part of the base,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:84%
maybe a whole acre of
the base, was completely

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.180 align:middle line:90%
destroyed from this explosion.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Now the rumors I heard
was they were practicing

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
utilizing some sort of
electromagnetic weapon,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and it completely disintegrated
a huge sphere of the base.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And there was no radiation
or anything like that,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:84%
but they were just trying to
contain the fires and the gas

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:84%
fires that were lit
from this explosion

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle line:84%
because they use a lot of
different flammable gases

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:90%
and chemicals down there.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So now it became a
contaminant issue

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
of locking down all the
air handlers in that area,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
locking down all the valves
in the different rooms

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that took
up probably 20 hours,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I think I was
there for that one.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So these things happen, and
you get a nice place to stay,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:90%
and then you'll just be updated.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And you'll hear either over
an intercom, on your folder,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.880 align:middle line:90%
or on your armband.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If you get
a nice place to stay,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.550 align:middle line:90%
how conventional is it?

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.490 align:middle line:84%
How much would it be like going
to a hotel room as opposed

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.890 align:middle line:84%
to something odd like you might
see in "Star Trek: The Next

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Generation"?

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.720 align:middle line:84%
No, the rooms are
never perfectly square.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.345 align:middle line:84%
For some reason they
have trapezoidal shapes.

00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:84%
There are many
different shaped rooms.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And all the furniture is
actually built into the wall

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and actually comes
out of the wall

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to have a
sit down or work at a desk.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It has a huge interactive
screen on the wall.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:90%
The screen is three-dimensional.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
You can do things like go on the
internet, you can read books,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
you can watch movies, you
can order food, my favorite.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.514 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
interesting dynamic

00:04:16.514 --> 00:04:17.930 align:middle line:84%
because the room
looks like-- when

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
you walk in-- completely
like, oh my gosh,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%
they just gave me a
room without a bed.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing in there.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's all built into
the walls of the room.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about your stand
in Murphy bed, either, closet

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.470 align:middle line:90%
that pops out.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:90%
These are really beautiful.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:84%
The architecture of
this is seamless,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.330 align:middle line:90%
just like on the crafts.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So these things will come out
of the wall for saving space.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And these rooms are also
used for different things.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the room
tonight is going

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to be used for someone to
sleep here and spend the night,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and maybe tomorrow it
will be used for storage.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it'll be used for
housing different types

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial races
because they're all different.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.230 align:middle line:84%
They need different
types of furniture,

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
different types of
living facilities

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:90%
and restrooms and whatnot.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm really curious
about one thing.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're saying that, like,
the bed would extrude out

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
of the wall, is it going to
be this weird rubber sheet?

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Or does it actually
have sheets like you

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:90%
would have on a typical bed?

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Like in other words, is
the bed with the sheets

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:90%
hidden on like a sliding tray?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.937 align:middle line:84%
Or is it more like it just kind
of morphs out of something?

00:05:26.937 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, it is kind of
industrial, where it actually

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
either comes out of the
wall or out of the floor.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It raises out of floor,
comes out of the wall.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's always a cover
on these things, a very light

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.870 align:middle line:90%
cover that you pull off.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And it has whatever
bedding for that race.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Like for us, of course, we would
just have sheets and things

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.027 align:middle line:90%
like you said.

00:05:46.027 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:84%
You also can control the
temperature in your room.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
You can control the humidity
because different races

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.587 align:middle line:84%
need certain
atmospheres to sleep in.

00:05:52.587 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's all these
different things.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
There also needs
different lighting.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually put, like,
if you wanted ultraviolet light

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:90%
in your room for some reason.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Many extraterrestrials
have special lighting

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:90%
that they are accustomed to.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't like the
lighting that we have.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.010 align:middle line:90%
It's uncomfortable for them.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So they can take off
their protective eyewear

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:90%
and rest and whatnot.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So there's many different
things for this one little room.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like having your own
little spaceship, actually.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can also change
the background noise.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
a wall in there

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that projects, let's
say, an outside display

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:84%
like the ocean or
a mountain top,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's because
psychologically, it

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.130 align:middle line:84%
helps us better to be in that
environment and less stress

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety to be on the body.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can also preview other
photos that are already there,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and videos that show on the wall
from other realms and plants,

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:84%
which was really neat
because not everyone that's

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
not from Earth would want
to see a beach, I'll say.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This sounds
like something

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that you'd really
want to spend time in.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.170 align:middle line:84%
It sounds really, really
cool, being in this room.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Were you able to
sleep, or were you

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
so jazzed by seeing alien worlds
and technology that you just

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.357 align:middle line:84%
want to stay up all night
just play around with it?

00:07:15.357 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, Yeah.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.357 align:middle line:90%
It's like your screen saver.

00:07:18.357 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:84%
All these pictures come
on your screen saver

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:90%
with your computer.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And once you've seen all 50
of them, it's like old hat.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:90%
So where you want to pick today?

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.980 align:middle line:90%
What screen do you want?

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:84%
The neat thing about
sleeping is the bed

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:90%
is actually also self-contained.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.790 align:middle line:90%
So it'll have like--

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:84%
on the sides of it, it actually
comes in like a spiral,

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's like a little globe
and it comes over your bed.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is for more
with other races, where

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:84%
they have to have the
environment pressurized

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:90%
for their body types.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:10%
And inside that,
which is neat, is

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:10%
kind of like you see the generic
mood lighting you would have

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:10%
at a restaurant or whatever.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:84%
There's these little diagrams
on the inside of the bed,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.806 align:middle line:84%
like right on the side,
on the top right side.

00:08:08.806 --> 00:08:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a little
computer screen,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:90%
and you can pick your moisture.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:90%
You can pick your mood lighting.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:10%
You can even pick
a breeze of stuff.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.461 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know exactly
where it comes from.

00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it comes
from under the bed,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.080 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, because I've
never seen a fan on this.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.812 align:middle line:84%
But you do feel circulating
air, which is neat.

00:08:27.812 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also change
the temperature in there

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:84%
compared to what's on
the outside of the bed.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:84%
So it is actually
air tight because you

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:90%
can create a vacuum in there.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let's talk
about the lockdown situation

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:84%
How do you know that there
is a lockdown, first of all?

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there like an intercom
system, or what happens?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.371 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, as you're
working in the operating room,

00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:51.920 align:middle line:84%
don't forget there's a system
in there where they are always

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.470 align:middle line:84%
in contact with you
through their helmets.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So you can hear if
something's going on.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, they'll come on
and say, we have a lockdown.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.471 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:00.471 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I can
respond to that.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Can't ask them why, where, what.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's all
because of security.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's a normal thing.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And they'll do fake
lockdowns all the time

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.152 align:middle line:84%
just so you get
used to the alarms,

00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:84%
you get used to
the red lights, you

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:84%
get use of these things
that are signaling you

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:90%
so you don't overreact.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's just another test.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep-- so it's
just like we have fire alarm

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.660 align:middle line:84%
checks in hotels and hospitals
and airports, you know.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:84%
They have to do that
every now and then.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
get used to that

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.180 align:middle line:84%
because you once a
month it happens.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So when it really does happen,
and all of a sudden you

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.102 align:middle line:84%
don't hear within a few minutes
that it's just an alarm check,

00:09:40.102 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:84%
then you might think, oh, there
must be something going on.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.162 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm not
going home tonight.

00:09:44.162 --> 00:09:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But somebody
at some point

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:84%
briefed you on what a lockdown
is and the level of danger

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:90%
that it might be.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.136 align:middle line:84%
So could you tell us about how
that information was conveyed?

00:09:52.136 --> 00:09:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you have to
go through the training.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Part of your training in here
that you have to do quarterly--

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
like in hospitals you
have to get TB tested,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.010 align:middle line:84%
you have to have your CPR
accreditation every year.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing in
these test facilities

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:90%
and the real facilities.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.900 align:middle line:84%
You have in services
where they're

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:84%
saying this is what
happens on a lockdown.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.960 align:middle line:90%
You stay where you're at.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't go anywhere until
we tell you where to go.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.236 align:middle line:84%
If there's an over
hour lockdown, which

00:10:20.236 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
means it goes over
your business hours,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:84%
your working duty
hours, then you'll

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:84%
be instructed to go to a
certain part of the facility

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
where you can go into your
room and maybe get something

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:84%
to eat at the cafeteria, or
just kind of waiting it out,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.351 align:middle line:90%
basically, is what you're doing.

00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you tell us a
little bit about the cafeteria,

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.140 align:middle line:84%
because when I hear cafeteria,
I think of trays, and you go

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.850 align:middle line:90%
and you have scoops of food.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.492 align:middle line:90%
You dump them on your thing.

00:10:47.492 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe somebody does
that for you, say,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.667 align:middle line:90%
I want that, I want that.

00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Then you go to your table
after you got your silverware,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:90%
you paid a cashier.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.220 align:middle line:84%
How would this cafeteria be
like that, or is it different?

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The
cafeterias are nothing

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
like we have here
that we would normally

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:90%
see when you go out to eat.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.310 align:middle line:84%
These cafeterias are
very plain on the inside.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.630 align:middle line:84%
All the walls have a
transparent mirror image coating

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.270 align:middle line:84%
where you can just
touch the wall, order

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.850 align:middle line:90%
your menu of whatever you want.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And let's say you wanted to have
a salad with grilled chicken.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:90%
That'll be on there.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like when
someone's taking your order.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:84%
You're taking your own
order on this wall.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Would this be
like an iPad kind of thing?

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, the entire wall.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And these walls
are huge and long.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Some of the cafeterias
there are like 60 feet long.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:90%
And they have very--

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
the chairs and the
tables look so bland,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a steel
picnic table with stools.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:90%
And some have backs, some don't.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Some are very large
chairs, some are

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.290 align:middle line:84%
very small for
different sized people

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.880 align:middle line:90%
and different sized races.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Some chairs don't look
like anything like chairs.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Some have large countertops
off the actual wall

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.390 align:middle line:84%
that extend like three
feet out of the wall.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And some of those might be
six feet off the ground.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So that being said, it's
all a very intuitive program

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:84%
when you go up to the wall
to order whatever you want.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you're getting
your chicken salad

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
with your chocolate milkshake,
you put the order in

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and you go down to
the side of the wall,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be there
on the inside.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
This glass will kind
of move up, and then

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:84%
you can see the food there, and
you just grab it and take it

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:90%
to your table.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.071 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There's something
I'm not visualizing, though.

00:12:37.071 --> 00:12:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is are you
saying that there's just

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
a huge number of different
pieces of text of all

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.210 align:middle line:90%
these different types of food?

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.412 align:middle line:84%
Or can you click on things
and open up folders?

00:12:46.412 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You can click on it.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:84%
They have a picture
method of a diagram

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
of different types
of vegetables,

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:84%
different types of meats
and things like that.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:90%
And the entire wall does it.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're
taller than me,

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and you would touch the
wall with your hand.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:90%
And then it just comes clear.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:90%
You can see a screen around you.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And it can do it all
the way on the floor.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's not a specific--
wherever you touch this wall,

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:84%
this thing happens where you
can actually place this order.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is just one cafeteria
of many different kinds.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.169 align:middle line:90%
But this is a really fun one.

00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:26.834 align:middle line:84%
That's why I want to
talk about this one

00:13:26.834 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
specifically because
I think people

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
will relate to this, people
that have been in the projects.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So you get your food and
you go down a little bit.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
of the wall, there's

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
a big section that's open,
like you could see a dishwasher

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
person in a regular cafeteria
where you put your trays in

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:90%
and stuff to wash.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:90%
It's the opposite.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
food is actually

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.590 align:middle line:90%
brought into this cubbyhole.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is there's also

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:84%
levels of the
cubbyholes of sizes

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:03.020 align:middle line:84%
off the floor for different
races and for different people.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And from there you just take
your food to your table.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Is it on a tray?

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.354 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, it usually isn't.

00:14:10.354 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It would be
like a plate, then?

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a large plate
with everything on it.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Not a TV dinner.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Now they do have trays
there if you want.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:90%
But no one uses trays.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle line:84%
You just grab food and
take it to the table.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And the table is the best
thing about the cafeteria.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I love the table because the
table is another giant screen.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:84%
These tables are 10, 20 feet
long, about five feet across,

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:90%
five to six feet across.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:10%
Some have already pre-positioned
chairs at these tables.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
You can fit 10, 20 people
sometimes at a table,

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.890 align:middle line:84%
depending on the people
that are sitting there.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And then there's tables
that are just tables.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And out of the actual ground,
as you're going up to the table,

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
you just start to sit down and
a stool comes out of the ground.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:90%
It's really neat.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.142 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't look--

00:15:04.142 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
like you would
think you would hear

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:84%
a sound of [MECHANICAL SOUND],,
like your stool's here.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
It just comes out of
the ground silently.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But they're all
very similar sizes.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
The ones that come
out of the ground

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:23.450 align:middle line:84%
are pretty much a normal, maybe,
foot and a half in diameter.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows where
your silverware is.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And your condiments and all
that stuff is in the table.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So you have this giant
picnic table, we'll say,

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.200 align:middle line:90%
and it's all made out of steel.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Looks like steel.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Not stainless steel,
like a matte steel.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The table itself
looks like you're

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.800 align:middle line:90%
eating off an iPhone screen.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean the table itself.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So when you put your hand
out in a special motion,

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.390 align:middle line:84%
like flat hand is
napkins, double tapping

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.940 align:middle line:90%
is forks, knives, and spoons.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The actual napkin,
as you go like this,

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:84%
comes out of the
table into your hand.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea what
this technology is.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.320 align:middle line:90%
But there's no sliding anything.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
There is not a door opening up
and these condiments come out

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.260 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
It's all just on tapping and
pulling your hand across it

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:90%
to get something out.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Now if you don't know how to do
that, which they do teach you

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.240 align:middle line:84%
different things to
do, you can actually

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.170 align:middle line:84%
hold your hand on the table
and a little intuitive apps

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:90%
will come up.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And it'll have a picture
of a ketchup bottle,

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
a picture of mustard,
barbecue sauce,

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:90%
and all these little pictures.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:35.986 align:middle line:90%
Everything's pictures.

00:16:35.986 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:90%
There's no words.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can touch and tap on
the ketchup bottle or whatever,

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:90%
and the same thing happens.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Whatever's underneath
this table,

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:84%
it becomes not solid in that
area where the condiments are.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to become
clear, the table, where

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.949 align:middle line:84%
you can see the condiments
right underneath your hand.

00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are they like
little ketchup packs

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:90%
like you get at the restaurant?

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.793 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Same stuff that we use.

00:17:03.793 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:84%
The same stuff you probably get
at the fast food restaurants.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't use condiments, but--

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:84%
definitely this is
one of the things

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:84%
that I was so intrigued
about, and everybody

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.329 align:middle line:84%
was, because this
technology could be used

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:16.500 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of better things.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Like we could use that
technology in surgery.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:84%
But for whatever reason,
this is how it is,

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.680 align:middle line:90%
and there is palpable.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So once you take your hand
off, it becomes solid again.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is probably one of
the most amazing technologies

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:90%
that they share with everyone.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:84%
But no one's allowed
to know how it works.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.504 align:middle line:84%
You can't ask--
there's no one to ask.

00:17:38.504 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing,
You're not allowed

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:90%
to ask about technologies.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.150 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to ask
certain things about your room.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to ask about
why does he have this special

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:90%
folder and you don't.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
interesting concept

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.630 align:middle line:84%
of high tech stuff that's
way advanced compared

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
to what we have right
now here that should

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
be out right now,
but probably not

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.010 align:middle line:90%
because it would be dangerous.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.135 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, you said
that this is napkin, right?

00:18:04.135 --> 00:18:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Down and out is napkin.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Double tap is for
condiments or silverware.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Silverware.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:10.688 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Or silverware.

00:18:10.688 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So were there other
gestures like that?

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, there's different
gestures for your hand,

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.127 align:middle line:90%
especially if you use--

00:18:18.127 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:84%
double tapping, too--I'm
sorry, I should tell you double

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle line:84%
tapping means you have to
use at least two fingers.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
more than two fingers.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:84%
But you can also
draw on the table.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you needed a special
utensil because there's

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.550 align:middle line:84%
different utensils for
different races, which

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.170 align:middle line:90%
is really interesting.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And by putting your
whole palm on the hand,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:84%
then you get to scroll
through that little app,

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.524 align:middle line:84%
and you can pick a special
utensil or special whatever.

00:18:49.524 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I
must tell you is

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:84%
that where the napkins
is different than where

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:84%
the condiments come out,
which is different from where

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.010 align:middle line:90%
the silverware comes out.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And the silverware is always
going to be on your left,

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.301 align:middle line:84%
and the condiments and
napkins are on your right.

00:19:03.301 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's all it does
is those types of things.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you
ever think that there

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:84%
might be some sort
of particalization

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:84%
or materializer technology
making the food?

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Because I've heard from
a lot of other people

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.430 align:middle line:84%
that have been through similar
things that they could quote,

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:90%
unquote print a meal.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:84%
All the food and everything
that they have there

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.820 align:middle line:84%
that's of substance--
not drinks, though--

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.200 align:middle line:84%
but everything
else is 3D printed.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything
about whether there

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.500 align:middle line:84%
is a raw material
that's required to make

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:90%
the food that they start with?

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.935 align:middle line:90%
Or how does that work, exactly?

00:19:41.935 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, through
my experiences working

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:84%
with 3D printing of
organs and other projects

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been involved with, it
has to do with, like you said,

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
the particles and
the atomic structure

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.490 align:middle line:84%
can be reproduced anywhere
for a head of lettuce

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:84%
to a brain, which all
has the same construct.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.660 align:middle line:84%
It's all mass and atoms and
how those mass and atoms

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:90%
are rearranged in molecules.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So basically you can
probably print anything.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so easy for the
system to make any kind of food

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:90%
you want.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:84%
They also have this device
that the food goes through

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.010 align:middle line:84%
after it's printed
in the back that

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.610 align:middle line:84%
is able to cook the food
to a certain temperature

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:84%
or cool it to a
certain temperature,

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:90%
which I find fascinating.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:90%
But it does it within seconds.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.430 align:middle line:90%
So medium rare, seconds.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Below 32 degrees, seconds,
because each meal is made

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:90%
in under, like, three minutes.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's how fast
these 3D printers are.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear
them behind the wall.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah it's very
archaic noises like servos

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:84%
going back and forth and ring,
ring, ring, ring, ring, ring,

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.020 align:middle line:90%
ring.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:57.912 align:middle line:90%
And then, you know--

00:20:57.912 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of my
space program insiders

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:84%
who never has been willing to
come forward is named Jacob.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And he described
very similar things.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But he also said that the
food has some extra benefits

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.416 align:middle line:90%
that normal food wouldn't have.

00:21:13.416 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to lead
you, but could you tell me

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.832 align:middle line:90%
if you knew anything like that?

00:21:16.832 --> 00:21:17.631 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:21:17.631 --> 00:21:19.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the great thing
about the food there.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:90%
It's over nutritional.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.790 align:middle line:84%
What we have standards here on
the back of boxes and things,

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.280 align:middle line:84%
it's just horrific
that they could

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:84%
be doing this-- you know adding,
a little bit more vitamin C

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:84%
to something, or adding a little
bit more minerals to something.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:84%
They do the least amount
here out in the real world.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:90%
But in there, it's the opposite.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like super heavy doses
of all sorts of minerals

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and things that are
not found the surface,

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
is what we say,
and also takes away

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:84%
things that are harmful in
there, like toxins and fats.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's printed
without any of that.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Jacob also said
that this food could

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
clean your mouth as
you eat it and would

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:84%
digest into pure
nutrition in your body.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious if you
had that experience.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't
know that for a fact.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I just know what
they've taught me

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and told me their about the
nutritional value of the food,

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:90%
it's the best of the best.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing in there
that's put in there to--

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.780 align:middle line:84%
you know, we are an investment
to these corporations.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.460 align:middle line:90%
We are a huge investment.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And they take really
good care of us

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:84%
as far as nutrition, medical,
and things like that,

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.219 align:middle line:90%
unless you make a mistake.

00:22:30.219 --> 00:22:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Some of the people I've
talked to about this printed

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:90%
food--

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.230 align:middle line:84%
not all of them-- some of the
insiders have said that it is

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.190 align:middle line:84%
the most amazingly good
tasting, flavorful--

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.790 align:middle line:84%
like each meal is the
best possible realization

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:84%
of that dish you
could ever imagine.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That is true.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:84%
It tastes better than anything
I've had on the surface.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think that has to do
with the quality of the cells

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that they
made the food from,

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of nutrition
that goes in there.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And being able to print food
without the bad things that

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:84%
are in normal meals,
pesticides and whatnot.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:90%
There's none of that.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
purest apple you're ever

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.180 align:middle line:90%
going to eat in your life.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And there were some sort
of enzymes and things

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:90%
they add to food.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So like your friend said,
it will digest immediately

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:84%
into the system, and you won't
have as much digestive problems

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:27.770 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:28.962 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely true.

00:23:28.962 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let me
share another thing

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that Jacob said that I think
is interesting to add here.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.810 align:middle line:84%
His people in the
Secret Space Program

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
were worried that we
might become dependent

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.700 align:middle line:90%
on this super nutritious food.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.310 align:middle line:84%
They looked at the
physiologies of certain ETs,

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.920 align:middle line:84%
like some of the Gray
types, and it's literally

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:84%
like an esophagus that
goes right to the anus.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a tube, a
straight shot, no intestines,

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:90%
no stomach.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And they were
worried that perhaps

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.250 align:middle line:84%
if we don't use food
the old-fashioned way,

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:84%
that our systems
are not going to be

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.170 align:middle line:84%
able to survive anymore unless
we have this type of food.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.407 align:middle line:90%
Could you comment on that?

00:24:05.407 --> 00:24:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, I can.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I believe what's happening
here is the actual body

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:84%
really doesn't need food if
you can create the energy it

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:19.650 align:middle line:84%
needs, the cells and the genetic
disposition of your nucleolus

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
and of all the
cells in the body.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why some people
can go years without eating.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.460 align:middle line:90%
They have mastered that energy.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.910 align:middle line:84%
With a lot of the ETs we've
seen from the far future,

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.320 align:middle line:90%
they barely have a mouth.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.890 align:middle line:90%
They barely have a nose.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is over time we
will not be eating any more.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.670 align:middle line:84%
It'll just be something you do
for fun on the side to do that.

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.510 align:middle line:84%
It'll be just like
a social thing

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.300 align:middle line:84%
because all the energy
that your cells need,

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.610 align:middle line:84%
you can teletransport
into your body.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.940 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to do that
now with chemicals, with IVs,

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:84%
with vitamin IVs,
all these things.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe it's
going to go to a route

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
where we won't have
to eat any more.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And that being said, the
body, over millions of years,

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:84%
will adapt, and
some of the organs

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:84%
will not be needed
because the foods will

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:13.920 align:middle line:84%
be so pure you don't need
your liver and pancreas to add

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.610 align:middle line:84%
enzymes, and your gallbladder to
break down the food because it

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
already has it in
the nutritional

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.369 align:middle line:90%
value of the preprinted food.

00:25:21.369 --> 00:25:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Were you ever
able to have contact

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.800 align:middle line:84%
with the outside world
once you got in there?

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Or obviously, they're
not going to give you

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.267 align:middle line:90%
a telephone or anything.

00:25:29.267 --> 00:25:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.340 align:middle line:90%
It's heavily monitored.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Even the internet,
there's no cameras

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.662 align:middle line:84%
so you can't do a FaceTime
or something like that.

00:25:37.662 --> 00:25:39.870 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand, back
then a lot of this stuff

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:84%
really wasn't out there
like you guys have now.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.462 align:middle line:84%
It was really-- early 90s it
was just at its beginning stages

00:25:46.462 --> 00:25:47.670 align:middle line:90%
with the computers and stuff.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
But you had ways to go on and
watch things, listen to things,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.812 align:middle line:84%
but mostly just
for entertainment.

00:25:54.812 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:84%
You are not allowed to
communicate with anyone.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:84%
You are not allowed to
have a mobile phone.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.455 align:middle line:84%
Back then I didn't
have a mobile phone.

00:26:00.455 --> 00:26:01.320 align:middle line:90%
We had beepers.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And no electronics you
were allowed to bring.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It sounds really
like a wonderful place.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm curious if you
could request to stay there

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.926 align:middle line:90%
if there wasn't a lockdown.

00:26:13.926 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Could you get to a
certain level of clearance

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.780 align:middle line:84%
where they'd allow
you to do that?

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm not
aware, In my facility,

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
of anyone being allowed to
stay there just because.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
There would have to be an event
that they asked you to stay,

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:35.030 align:middle line:84%
or something went wrong
where they had a lockdown.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.105 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't authorized
to just say, hey,

00:26:37.105 --> 00:26:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I want to stay a month
here and hang out.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.874 align:middle line:90%
No, not at all.

00:26:40.874 --> 00:26:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was
the longest time

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.180 align:middle line:84%
that you got to
spend on lockdown,

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:84%
because it sounds like it's
not really a bad thing.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was there almost
a week, about six days,

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:90%
on one lockdown.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was just because of
lockdown, my area was damaged.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So I actually wanted to
work overtime and extra time

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.510 align:middle line:90%
to get caught up for--

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:84%
sometimes there are
deadlines to get things done,

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and I was working on a
really interesting project,

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:84%
so I wanted to stay, I
wanted to get it done.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I had no problem
staying the extra time.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really have too
many friends and family.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:90%
This was my life.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.790 align:middle line:90%
This is how I lived.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, it also
shows that you're really

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.480 align:middle line:90%
willing to help and be there.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they
give you a choice.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.220 align:middle line:90%
You have a choice.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.950 align:middle line:84%
You can stay and
finish the project,

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:33.770 align:middle line:84%
or you can at least
work eight, and then

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:90%
you can leave and come back.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.074 align:middle line:90%
But please come back.

00:27:36.074 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
do that because I

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:84%
could work an easy
12, 14 hours and not

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:84%
be tired because the
air quality is great.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
The water is fourth
state of water.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.300 align:middle line:90%
The food is highly nutritional.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.340 align:middle line:90%
And it was just like you said.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a place that
was interesting,

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and for me, exciting to be
part of such an amazing thing.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And every time I ever
went back to work

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.430 align:middle line:90%
I learned something new.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I would learn things
about the new races.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I would be able to overstay
my time in the library, which

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:90%
was really important to me.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Was there ever a
case of a lockdown where

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.270 align:middle line:84%
everybody was
genuinely terrified,

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and some knowledge of what
was going on did seep through?

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.087 align:middle line:84%
Or was it always just oh,
we're on lockdown again.

00:28:20.087 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what this is.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.165 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:28:22.165 --> 00:28:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, there was a
couple of times like that.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of frightening
when a major lockdown happens

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and you don't get to
know what's going on.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to stay a
night, just like one night.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And then usually you
find out why it happened,

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.270 align:middle line:84%
or they'll just send in
a disinformation campaign

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and say oh, there was a
fire or something, something

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.080 align:middle line:84%
so generic you know
they're lying to you.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's the excuse to help
you relax and wait for the fire

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.050 align:middle line:90%
to go out, we'll say.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these things,
we didn't know what happened.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.367 align:middle line:84%
Usually if you stay on
the projects long enough,

00:28:59.367 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:84%
you'll find out like
nine months later

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.770 align:middle line:84%
or a year later, oh, that's
why we were on lockdown

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:90%
back in January for two days.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Someone left with a
virus or something

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and they had to cleanse
that whole wing.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
cleanse, it's not good,

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.925 align:middle line:84%
because whoever's in that
wing has to be terminated.

00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, this is
extremely fascinating.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure, like many
people watching this,

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I hope I get to see
stuff like this one day.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.901 align:middle line:84%
If we do get any type
of real disclosure,

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:31.400 align:middle line:84%
what an incredible
journey that will

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.030 align:middle line:84%
be for us as a civilization to
start to get to use technology

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:36.763 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:29:36.763 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I would love to
take you in there.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.205 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, maybe
we'll figure it out.

00:29:40.205 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank
you for watching.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:46.520 align:middle line:84%
