00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.020 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we are with Tim,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor to
covert analysts trying

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.350 align:middle line:10%
to understand the missions
and strategies of nonhuman

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.150 align:middle line:10%
intelligences on our planet.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.062 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Tim.

00:00:31.062 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thanks for having me.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.955 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is the perspective
of Being 6 about the pyramids?

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That's a
fascinating topic, Emery.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So basically we
know that Being 6

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
is a interfrequential
being outside of time.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's operating on
level six consciousness.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So from their perspective,
the whole universe in itself

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:84%
is covered with these
strange fields of clouds

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.260 align:middle line:90%
where paradoxes are going on.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So basically if we look at
this cloud, this version

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:84%
of the universe that
we're experiencing,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:84%
we have this dualism
going on, which

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:90%
means you, I, everything else.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And that basically
brings certain paradoxes

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:84%
to this reality, which means
they need to be decided.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And what Being 6 then did
was putting pyramids in place

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
not only on this planet but
also on different other planets

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
so that creation or the
creator can observe itself.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the pyramids,
at least the big one

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:84%
in Giza is basically meant
to be a technology in order

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
to observe this reality, this
cloud of potential that Being 6

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:84%
has seen and wanted
to investigate.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
That is also the
reason why this pyramid

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.010 align:middle line:84%
is so strongly correlated
with the speed of light.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:84%
The top of itself,
you find a lot

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
of algorithms that deal
with the speed of light

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:84%
and its function
around the pyramid.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.830 align:middle line:10%
And Being 6 stated
that the pyramid

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:10%
itself not only has a
materialistic component,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:10%
but it also has a inverted
pyramid outside of time that

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:10%
fulfills or completes this
tetrahedron structure.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:84%
We basically cannot see
it because it's not inside

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.510 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:84%
But that is basically
what Being 6 has told us.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When you say the
equivalent of outside of time,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
you mean the pyramid
we can see in the 3D

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
but it's also in existence
in another dimension,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.950 align:middle line:90%
you would say?

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yes, that is what
Being 6 told us what

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:90%
they did with this pyramid.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what was the
functions of the pyramid

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.635 align:middle line:90%
according to Being 6.

00:03:01.635 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It has quite a multitude
of functions going on.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:84%
The first function,
of course, is

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:84%
to make light observable to
this higher frequential being

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
that wants to observe its own
paradoxes, its own reality.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So that is basically
the first function.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.900 align:middle line:84%
The second function is in
order to balance and stabilize

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:90%
the vibrational field of Earth.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
why we have all

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
these different pyramids all
aligned to certain energy lines

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
The third function was to
harvest certain energies,

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
subtle energies because
the whole planet itself

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:90%
has an electromagnetic field.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And there are planes that
have a lot of energy going on.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And those pyramids
basically attract those ions

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and bring them
into the pyramids.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And from that, they give
energy to different places

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's the correlation
with the alignment of some

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids in Egypt
with, for instance,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.045 align:middle line:90%
the Orion star system?

00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That's interesting
because originally, there

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.360 align:middle line:84%
was only this one pyramid
which was built there

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:84%
as the prior and first
pyramid on this planet.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:90%
We see then that some species--

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.520 align:middle line:84%
some Egyptian species has
built two more pyramids.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And we can see different other
pyramids around the planet.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys told us that the
reason for this constellation

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:84%
with Orion was for them to
collect some of the humans

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:84%
from the previous
version of the cycle.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So basically, Earth goes
through certain cycles.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:90%
And those people are all gone.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
They're all somewhere, not
on this planet anymore.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
cycle, all these species,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
they try to get their hands
on as many of the people.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:84%
They describe them
as fruits to us.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So basically all
those beings that

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.160 align:middle line:84%
are ready for other
incarnations and stuff.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
They are basically like fruits
and get collected from them.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And they use these pyramids, the
three pyramids aligned to Orion

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.265 align:middle line:84%
in order to get some of the
bodies out of the planet.

00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:41.275 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did Being 6 indicate
to you who built the pyramids?

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yes, Being 6 basically
told us that he, it's, we,

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:84%
they are responsible for
building the first pyramid

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and that they have certain
members of their collective

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:84%
that helped building the
pyramids in Mexico as well.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't actually know who
basically built them, so which

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:90%
species, who, which individual.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:84%
But basically, Being 6 was part
of the original building team.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:84%
We know then that the other
pyramids were built basically

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:84%
by humans and in a collective
effort with other species

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:29.470 align:middle line:84%
that 15,000 years ago, there
wasn't this travel embargo.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was, kind of, more
of an open contact world.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't unusual that humans
were building stuff together

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.156 align:middle line:90%
along with other species.

00:06:43.156 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If Being 6
is a non-3D being,

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:90%
how did they build the pyramids?

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, we asked them that.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is quite obscure.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.020 align:middle line:90%
They said they thought of it.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So basically it seems to
be a mental process to them

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:90%
to have built the pyramids.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That makes sense, yeah.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:90%
Thought, form.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.945 align:middle line:90%
So manifestation.

00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And now it
got perpetuated.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And now you got this
kind of specific look.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The top of the
pyramid has been removed

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and so is the casing
on the outside.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Is that going to affect
the energetic properties

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramid?

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes, 100%.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:84%
By having removed these
two specific elements

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid, they
basically made sure

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
that they are not
going to work anymore.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So what we have
is the pyramidion

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:84%
on top, which is
basically guiding

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
those subtle energies
towards the different phases

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramid.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And the cover of the pyramid
was actually very important

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
because it keeps the ions
and the different electrical

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
charges inside of the
pyramid so that it can

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:90%
be guided towards the pyramid.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Once that has been
removed, the pyramid

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:90%
could not hold its energy.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.765 align:middle line:90%
And it gets all over the place.

00:08:11.765 --> 00:08:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's dispersed out--

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It dispersed.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --to the planet?

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So if you did
put the capstone back on

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and the casing, what
effect would that have?

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It would have tremendous
effect in certain ways.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you
put the pyramid back

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:90%
into functionality.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:90%
It would work again.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:84%
It would affect very strongly
the energetical field of Earth

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:90%
and itself in a positive way.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:84%
A lot of healing properties
would be in place again.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Basically, meditative
states could

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:84%
be reached very
easily and also what

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:90%
we call manifestation process.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So basically our own
thoughts and mental process

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
manifest our reality,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:84%
that would work much
stronger and much faster.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If the pyramid was
completely intact again,

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.780 align:middle line:84%
who would benefit from
that, the extraterrestrials,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:90%
the human beings on the planet?

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Good question.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:90%
It would benefit life.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it would create a
very positive and very healing

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
energetical field
that you could utilize

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.010 align:middle line:90%
in whatever way you want it.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So it could heal people,
potentially humans, as well as

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:90%
nonterrestrials.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And it would integrate certain
other, for example, stargates,

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.530 align:middle line:84%
jumpgates, so that they
could be used as well.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We have pyramids
all around the world.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:84%
In the Arctic, South America,
are these pyramids, number one,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:90%
connected?

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.128 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, did
the same people

00:09:59.128 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:90%
build all these pyramids?

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yes, they
are all connected

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.080 align:middle line:84%
not only on this planet but
even on other planets as well.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:10%
You can see that
Mars, for example,

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:13.040 align:middle line:10%
has pyramidal structures and
potentially every other planet

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we see they are connected.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And they have done that for a
purpose of distributing energy

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.840 align:middle line:84%
through the whole body of
Earth, which is basically

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
the thought that Nikola
Tesla in the 1920s

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:84%
had when he wanted to charge
the whole Earth so you can

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:84%
basically have energy
in the wild desert of I

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.080 align:middle line:90%
don't know where.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And you could connect
to that energy

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:90%
on every place on the world.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically what
happened with the pyramids.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Are they all built
by the same people?

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:90%
No, they are not.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the first
pyramid which is in Giza

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:84%
was the initial pyramid that
was placed there in order

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
to observe life itself
probably before there were even

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:90%
people on this planet.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.335 align:middle line:90%
So the pyramid came first.

00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are the pyramids
functional on other timelines?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.865 align:middle line:90%
And how would that work?

00:11:15.865 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: So what we know is--

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:90%
and this is very complicated.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:84%
But Being 6 described
to us that the pyramids

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:84%
have different equivalents
on different other timelines.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're all connected
through this outside-of-time

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:90%
grid that's going on there.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramids, they do not
only connect in physical space

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.920 align:middle line:90%
but outside of it as well.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.630 align:middle line:90%
What would that indicate?

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:90%
What would it be for?

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:84%
It could be utilized in
order to bring something

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:84%
from one dimension into
another dimension that

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:90%
could very well be made use of.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:04.020 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, I couldn't
think of any possible function.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they
mention pyramids

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.262 align:middle line:84%
being not just in our galaxy but
other galaxies, other planets?

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:90%
And are they connected?

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, yes.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
Being 6 told us

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:84%
is that everywhere in this
version of the universe that

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.870 align:middle line:84%
is heavily based
upon visual light,

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
we see pyramids everywhere
on almost every planet

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:84%
because it has to do with the
functionality of observing

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:90%
nature in itself.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
If they are used in other
versions of the universe that

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.190 align:middle line:84%
is not connected to
sunlight, we don't know.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:84%
It might be some different other
geometrical structure there.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:84%
We know there are
universes that are heavily

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.510 align:middle line:90%
focused on acoustic signals.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So they might have
an equivalent,

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:84%
a geometrical equivalent to that
but interwoven in a sound wave.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:90%
That could be true.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned
earlier the pyramid

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:90%
being a tetrahedron shape.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And what's the significance
of that here on Earth?

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yes, so what
they told us is

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:84%
that there are
certain polygons that

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
are used to make up reality
the way we can perceive it.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And that geometrical
form is basically

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
a tetrahedron, which
is two pyramids stacked

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:90%
over each other.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically some of
the underlying geometrical form

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:90%
of how reality builds itself.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.903 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and we see that
resembling in the pyramids.

00:13:43.903 --> 00:13:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there any
significance, Tim,

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.150 align:middle line:84%
to modern day pyramids
like the Louvre in Paris?

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, I don't know
if there is a secretive plan

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:90%
or something to build pyramids.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
It would probably be much
easier to rebuild those

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:90%
that are already in place.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But yes, so the pyramids,
for example, in Paris

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:84%
is basically built
upon the pyramids

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:90%
that they have found in Giza.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So it can function the same
way the pyramids in Giza

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:90%
have functioned.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who builds
these pyramids-- and we

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:84%
know, for example, that
in the United Kingdom,

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:84%
the royal house,
the royal family,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:84%
they have built the
pyramids as well.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.365 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, they function.

00:14:31.365 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does it matter what
the pyramid is made out of?

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes, it does.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.160 align:middle line:90%
It does matter.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So basically-- and this
is pretty fascinating.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I found that pretty
fascinating, Being 6

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
told us about how to build
your own pyramid at home.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And yes, the material matters.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:84%
It must be built
in certain phases

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:84%
so you can have this
guidance of energetical flow

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that's going through
the pyramid itself.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But yes, it must create a
differential-- a potential so

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:90%
that the energy can flow.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why did
Being 6 tell you

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:90%
how to build a pyramid at home?

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The why question,
that's always the hardest.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if Being 6 knew
that at one time or another

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.535 align:middle line:84%
I would be able to
share it with people

00:15:17.535 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:90%
so they can build something.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:84%
But it has gigantic
benefits to it to build it.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And we see a situation
right now where people--

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.470 align:middle line:84%
where this travel embargo is
still in place where people

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:90%
cannot easily leave Earth.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:38.610 align:middle line:84%
All those stargates that we
have originally on this planet,

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:90%
they are all sealed.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So maybe Being 6
wants to make sure

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.785 align:middle line:84%
that there are devices that
you could build yourself

00:15:47.785 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:84%
in your own home with
just a few materials.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And you build your own
pyramid and utilize the powers

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:90%
that come along with that.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:90%
This is not only--

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:84%
so they describe to us
that having these pyramids

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and being in these pyramids
when they are covered.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.950 align:middle line:90%
And they are built very well.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And that the manifestation
process is very accelerated.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can even use the
natural-occurring flows

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:84%
of energies in order to
build your own stargate.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.635 align:middle line:84%
So that would be pretty
awesome if people do that.

00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, correct
me if I'm wrong.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:90%
But the pyramid is a stargate.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe
Being 6 wanted people

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.917 align:middle line:84%
to be able to meditate
in there and travel,

00:16:39.917 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:90%
astrally travel to other places.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That is
actually what I think,

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:90%
what their motivation is.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
In order to prevent the way
this world is structured,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:84%
it keeps this technology
away from people.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the
normal person at home

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
would probably not get the
hands on certain technology.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.675 align:middle line:84%
So Being 6 told us that's a way
you can do it yourself at home.

00:17:08.675 --> 00:17:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Excellent.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.140 align:middle line:10%
There has been
pyramid-shaped craft

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:10%
all over the world, the
Kremlin, Washington, DC.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.925 align:middle line:10%
Is there any significance
to the shape of these craft?

00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: Well, yes.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:10%
So basically it resembles
some of the geometric forms

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:27.319 align:middle line:10%
that you find in the universe.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Is it a must-have?

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:90%
No, it is not.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So we see that a lot of other
crafts are roundish in design

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.540 align:middle line:84%
or could even have
a abstract form

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and will still
work the same way.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
They must make sure that the
electromagnetic field that

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:84%
is around the craft, that
this is intact and is working.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But yes, some species,
they seem to be pretty

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.380 align:middle line:90%
obsessed with pyramid shapes.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:84%
They use them like for
everything, for the houses,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:90%
for the craft.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you
know what species

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:90%
is behind these pyramidal UFOs?

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yes, so we know
that some of these cases

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:84%
of pyramidal
structures that just

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.800 align:middle line:84%
appear over certain
cities in the world,

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:84%
that this is not actually
coming from a certain species.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's more from a
interfrequential collective

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that oversees developments
on this planet.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And they have told
us that they want

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:40.970 align:middle line:84%
to give chance to people
for the mysterium,

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:84%
the mystery of life
to be observed.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So basically what they do is
it's not a physical mission

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:90%
that they are on.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's more of a
cognitive-spiritual mission.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And they create
certain situations

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:84%
where people just
observe something.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:08.155 align:middle line:84%
And it expands their own minds,
expands their own thinking.

00:19:08.155 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So coming from a
human perspective

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.120 align:middle line:84%
one might think that
a physical mission has

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
to have a certain goal, they
want to achieve something.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the case when
you see certain situations

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:90%
from interfrequential beings.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:84%
They do things, so they get
observed and recognition.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:90%
And this is basically it.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We see pyramids being
built throughout history.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't it that
today that Being 6

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.970 align:middle line:90%
is not building pyramids today?

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yes, so Being 6
made it very clearly to us

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:84%
that the time of
pyramids is over,

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.660 align:middle line:84%
that basically they fulfilled
a certain functionality

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:84%
in the past, and that the beings
that inhabit this planet right

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:84%
now, humans, are
capable of doing

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
spiritual work with themselves
with their own bodies.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Their own bodies
are capable of doing

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.770 align:middle line:84%
manifestation and meditation
and all those things.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So why they say
that, the pyramids

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
still would be functional
and very positive

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.650 align:middle line:90%
if we rebuild those structures.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.820 align:middle line:84%
They also say that they
are not necessary anymore

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:84%
because the body,
the human body itself

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:84%
is capable of doing all the
functionality of the pyramid

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.145 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:20:36.145 --> 00:20:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did Being 6 ever
mention the human body

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.120 align:middle line:90%
being a pyramid?

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: No, they didn't mention
the human body being a pyramid.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:53.890 align:middle line:84%
They mentioned it to be
a very productive tool

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that needs to grow with
yourself, with your awareness

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and your soul, and that you can
perform quasi-wondrous things

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.210 align:middle line:90%
with your body in itself.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And they gave some
examples of that.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:90%
And this is mind-blowing.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So basically they
said that when you're

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:84%
going in a deep
meditation, you can

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:84%
create your own electromagnetic
field around yourself

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
so that you basically
can levitate and even

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:84%
use your body for
interstellar travel yourself.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.020 align:middle line:90%
So no pyramid needed for that.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But I think this is some
meditation work that

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:90%
needs a lot of practice.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And we need to upgrade
the whole collective first

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:90%
before people--

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:55.530 align:middle line:84%
it can easily alter
reality this much.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you
think the government

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:84%
is using pyramid technology
in their secret programs?

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I basically don't know.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
certain groups are

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
very interested in understanding
the way the pyramids work.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And we've done a lot
of research on that

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
because basically the
functions of the pyramids

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.730 align:middle line:90%
are pretty much unlimited.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.560 align:middle line:90%
You can use it to heal.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:90%
You can use it to manifest.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:84%
You can use it to
send information

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.890 align:middle line:90%
throughout different dimensions.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I think that it would
be natural to use everything

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
you've learned from the
pyramids and apply it

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.670 align:middle line:90%
on your own technology.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have
information specifically.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: People are talking
about the possibility

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
of additional chambers yet to be
discovered in the Giza pyramid.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Has Being 6 ever mentioned
anything about this to you?

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes, 100%.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:84%
They have told us that there are
more than those chambers that

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:90%
are already known.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And they fulfill
different purposes.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.700 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they have healing
chambers that are still not--

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Excavated.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: --excavated.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
they have done is

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:84%
they've built certain
chambers where people just

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:21.070 align:middle line:84%
can lay down into a space
looking like a sarcophagus

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.210 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically more
like a mat-bed or something

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.150 align:middle line:90%
where a human could lay down.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And those things were in place
and in functionality way back.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were used
for healing purposes.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So they also told us
that the pyramid in Giza

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:84%
is different than the
pyramid in Mexico.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And that the pyramid
in Mexico was more

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:51.340 align:middle line:90%
used for community events.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So people-- more than one
person can enter the pyramid

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:90%
and gets healed.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And that the pyramid
in Giza was much more

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:06.820 align:middle line:84%
an isolated experience
for certain individuals.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: As more
extraterrestrial contact

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:84%
happens, do you think there's
going to be a revival of more

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:90%
pyramid technology?

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: If I had a
wish, I would say

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.920 align:middle line:84%
that people should
rebuild the pyramids

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:23.125 align:middle line:84%
and not only take them as
destroyed as they are right now

00:24:23.125 --> 00:24:26.410 align:middle line:90%
but make them work again.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that we
will see much more pyramid

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.540 align:middle line:90%
technology over time.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that people
start building pyramids

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And that could very well be
done through this blueprint

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.950 align:middle line:84%
that Being 6 gave us, which
makes it quite easy to build

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:84%
something where you can sit
in yourself as long as it has

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:56.820 align:middle line:84%
the covers and the right ground
so that the potential is there.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:90%
I would love to see that, yes.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that the government

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:84%
or some other sources will bring
in more pyramid technology.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.470 align:middle line:90%
