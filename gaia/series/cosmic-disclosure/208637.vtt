00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.420 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we are with Tim,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.040 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor from Germany
who analyzes and suggests

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.000 align:middle line:10%
various strategies in relation
to extraterrestrial groups

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.619 align:middle line:10%
in contact with Earth.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us today
is Captain Randy Cramer,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:10%
who claims to be the public
spokesperson for the United

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:10%
States Marine Corps
special section.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.125 align:middle line:84%
Today, it's going to be
a very intriguing episode

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:84%
because we're
going to be talking

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:90%
about hybrids and clones.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So I'll start off by
saying, I think we're

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:90%
kind of a hybrid type of being.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:84%
What do you guys
think about that?

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.982 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything
that I understand,

00:01:00.982 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
we have a mix of
dozens or potentially

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:84%
more than 100
different types of DNA

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:84%
into our system over thousands
and thousands of years.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, basically every
single person on the planet

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
is a hybrid of some
kind or another.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And Tim, who do
you think started this?

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So there could be
a natural evolution that

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily need
any manipulator species

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:90%
But so, to my knowledge, it's--

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:90%
I know of about 12 species.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Randy, you spoke about at
least 2025 or something.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Potentially even
more influences when

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.280 align:middle line:84%
they are small bits of data
infused into the human system,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
but there are some
species that have

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:90%
their interest in humanity.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:84%
They need the
experiences of humanity.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.630 align:middle line:84%
There are other species
that help to balance out

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:84%
the influences that
different species have put up

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:84%
on humanity, and some species
intermingled with humans

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:84%
to get advantage about
them at some point.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.175 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You both mentioned
numbers about how many hybrids

00:02:15.175 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:90%
you have encountered.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.362 align:middle line:84%
So how many hybrids
are walking amongst us?

00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying these
are ones that you've

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:84%
heard about in space
and in the universe?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But amongst us, what
kind of specifics

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:90%
you can give me about them?

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Like subspecies?

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, subspecies.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Guess hundreds.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, at least.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I have a friend
who lives in Las Vegas,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and I need to try
and see if I can

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
get a copy of this
photograph because I've

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:84%
seen this photograph, and she's
a little reluctant to share it.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
But she had a friend
who was working security

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:84%
at one of the casinos who
sat behind looking at all

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
the cameras, and luckily
he pulled out his phone

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and snapshotted the screen
that this was happening on

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:90%
before the camera went out.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So he's sitting there
watching the blackjack tables

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and watches the cameras,
watches these two guys

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
come in wearing shirts and
slacks like white shirt,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:90%
white slacks--

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:84%
pale, pale white skin,
big heads, small--

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:84%
normal human size
but black eyes.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
So there were probably some kind
of a hybrid, maybe some kind

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.785 align:middle line:90%
of a human Zeta, whatever.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:84%
But from what I
understand, there

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:84%
are some of these guys
that work at Nellis and out

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
at the test site, and
they come in to Vegas

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:90%
to drink, smoke, and gamble.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So apparently,
these guys come in.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:84%
One guy's got a
drink in his hand.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Other guy's got a drink and
a cigarette in his hand.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
They come and sit down
at the blackjack table.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
The picture is two guys
sitting at the blackjack table.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.378 align:middle line:84%
One guy is leaned in with
the cigarette like this.

00:03:44.378 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:90%
He's got his drink in his hand.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
The other guy's standing
there, and he looks up--

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.765 align:middle line:84%
when he apparently looked up
at the camera as the guy was--

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
when the whole
screen went blank.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So luckily he pulled out
his phone, took a snapshot,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
but then he calls down
to the pit boss and says,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.482 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you see
those guys standing

00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:90%
at the blackjack table.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, you mean those
two businessmen in suits.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, really?

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And so apparently, the
people who are on the floor

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.520 align:middle line:84%
saw them as guys wearing
suits, but that illusion

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:90%
didn't go through the camera.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.098 align:middle line:84%
So when the guy looked at the
camera like, oh, shut it off,

00:04:20.098 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
but apparently they
were able to cast

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
some kind of psionic illusion
because if it was a hologram,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.078 align:middle line:84%
the camera would have
also seen the hologram.

00:04:28.078 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So they were projecting some
kind of a psionic illusion

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.080 align:middle line:84%
that they're just
guys in business suits

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:84%
when they were clearly hybrids
going in to drink, smoke,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:90%
and play blackjack.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: True.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced that with
a reptilian species that

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
came to me at a
party; at an event,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and they seemed to
project out an appearance.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, they
came to me and said, oh,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.140 align:middle line:90%
are you a chameleon too?

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So they mis-- confused
me was one of them.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I said yes because
I was thinking

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:84%
in my head about my
philosophical mission on Earth,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and so I would say yeah, I
feel like I'm a chameleon too.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And he was then talking to
me like about I have this

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and that amount of
galactic credits.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I've stolen them.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:90%
I have already this amount.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And later on, I
realized that there's

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.027 align:middle line:84%
something like galactic
credits in the universe.

00:05:31.027 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes, absolutely.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So also one thing
because you mentioned Las Vegas.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
about that, Emery,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.690 align:middle line:84%
that some extraterrestrials
seem to enjoy Disney World.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.865 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, you
know about that?

00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, and
comic conventions.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Those are the other ones.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, comic book convention--

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --fit in good there.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, because
they fit right in.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Or if they're wearing a
costume, you don't see it,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes they're
not wearing a costume,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.070 align:middle line:84%
or they wear a
costume over their--

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.653 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they love
hanging out at those--

00:05:56.653 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Speaking about drawings,
I have this interesting story--

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:90%
personal story, private story.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken about
that very vaguely in one

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:90%
of the first episodes.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.860 align:middle line:90%
I was in the German forest.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
We had this hut or
something rented.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
People were having fun
in the party down there.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I was in the front
of the building.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly outside there
was some kind of light.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing that
through the windows.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for what's
happening outside,

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and there were two
beings that have never

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.460 align:middle line:84%
ever experienced before
or never seen them before.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much larger than
myself, at least 2 meters

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:90%
like maybe 210, 220--

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Yellowish skin.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:84%
They asked me if
they can come closer.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So they were very, very gentle
in the way they approached me,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.830 align:middle line:84%
which is great
because otherwise,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
maybe I've freaked
out or something.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:90%
I said yes.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:84%
They spoke German,
interestingly enough.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:84%
So I said yes, if you're a
friend you can speak to me.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:84%
They came to me with a
very short conversation,

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and they told me I'm
protected and that they

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.240 align:middle line:90%
wanted to make me know that.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.340 align:middle line:90%
And then they were gone.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:90%
They went outside.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:84%
They disappeared somewhere
in the forest and gone.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I made a drawing, and I
want to show this to you,

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and because I
looked in the files,

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.380 align:middle line:90%
I found nothing about them.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can have
like a look at it.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, so I've seen a
group of these people one time.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So I've been to the
Intergalactic Space Station

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.410 align:middle line:84%
a number of times for mostly
escorting diplomat missions--

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:90%
I've talked about that before.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
There were these tall, yellow
guys with these big heads.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And I remember saying
to one of the MSS--

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.430 align:middle line:90%
like, what in the world is that?

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, oh,
the banana heads,

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:84%
because they've got
this big head that's

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:90%
like a yellow banana.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.833 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
that's kind of rude.

00:08:05.833 --> 00:08:07.955 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, ah, no.

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:90%
They're banana heads.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:90%
We're naked monkeys.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.600 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's a little bit of
having fun with each other.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
have to mean an insult.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, they're evolved
from some kind of mollusk.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, which has something to
do with the texture of the body

00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and the color of the
skin and so forth,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:90%
and why their head's that way.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding is
they're fairly peaceful.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not saying that
they're a peacenik species,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:84%
but they're fairly peaceful,
involved in a lot of trade.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.429 align:middle line:84%
And they have a pretty
solid science core,

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:84%
so their scientific
divisions are usually

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.870 align:middle line:84%
interested in helping
other planets coming along.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, from what I
understand, they might only be,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:09:00.610 align:middle line:84%
mm, maybe 2,000 or 3,000 years
technologically ahead, which

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
is not that far
when you're talking

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:90%
about intergalactic technology.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:90%
But I've only seen them once.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:84%
But the ambassador called
them the banana heads, which,

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:90%
again, is not necessarily rude.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And they mentioned
where they came from.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was some star
system that starts

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.402 align:middle line:84%
with a Y that is escaping
my brain at the moment.

00:09:19.402 --> 00:09:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But I only just
ran into them once.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's about all I know.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.460 align:middle line:90%
But they seem really nice.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> That sounds like it was a
really good protection message

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:90%
for you, for your journey.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably, and it's one of
the reasons why I wanted to meet

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:39.400 align:middle line:84%
you in order to share some
information and to get that--

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:84%
asking you if you know something
about them, so thank you.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you're welcome.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I knew a little bit
and there you go.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's talk about these
hybrids walking amongst us.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what is their agenda?

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding is
most of them work here,

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.865 align:middle line:90%
most of them are contractors.

00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:55.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, right.

00:09:55.665 --> 00:09:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> They work with
various covert programs.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.820 align:middle line:84%
They're helping other engineers,
scientists, mechanics.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:90%
They're contractors.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>> In some cases, not the most
brilliant, not the smart--

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.190 align:middle line:90%
they're contractors.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:90%
They're smart.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:90%
They're good at their job.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And they're helping
out and do stuff.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, we also know of
that-- if we were to say,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.090 align:middle line:84%
all of those personnel, and we
were to put them in one circle

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.420 align:middle line:84%
of a pie graph or something,
there'd be a certain slice

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:90%
of that pie which would be--

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.710 align:middle line:84%
we'd refer to as spies,
criminals, or some form

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:90%
of nefarious actor in some way.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So there-- a tiny
percentage of those

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that are probably up to
no good, but the majority

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.590 align:middle line:90%
are contractors.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:90%
They work here.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:84%
They're working for a government
or military agency or space

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:84%
agency helping to build
parts, design parts.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Just be essentially off-world
skilled labor that we need

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle line:90%
to do those jobs.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't have enough
skilled humans to do them,

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.033 align:middle line:84%
so we get some
off-world contractors

00:10:57.033 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
who are often
hybrids, so they can

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:84%
communicate and hang out and eat
our food and breathe our air.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So another reason seems to
be like that some species are

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.770 align:middle line:84%
looking for a way to
communicate with humanity.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And for example,
the Greys that have

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
placed a species that is in
pop culture called Tall Whites,

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So those are essentially hybrids
coming from Greys in order

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.270 align:middle line:90%
to path--

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:84%
way for contact, which
is their approach

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
to think that it's
more natural for us

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
to speak and
communicate with them.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They still look a little exotic
to the human eye, I guess.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Range Four Harry--

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
so Range Four Harry
was a ghost that used

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.632 align:middle line:90%
to wander the Nevada test site.

00:11:53.632 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And people who
would work out there

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
would see-- oh, I
saw Range Four Harry.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And they basically say it's
a tall guy in a suit who

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:84%
seems like a ghost, because
he's all white and kind

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.847 align:middle line:90%
of pale and glows.

00:12:03.847 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And they would just
think, ah, it's a ghost.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:84%
But they called him
Range Four Harry.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.225 align:middle line:84%
And it was just-- yeah, Tall
White who's wandering out

00:12:10.225 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:90%
in the dark at night.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:90%
And they'd spot him.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And they would just say it
was a ghost and nicknamed

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:90%
him Range Four Harry.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible for a hybrid
to be on the planet and have

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
a high political position or
military position that could be

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.660 align:middle line:90%
working in a nefarious way?

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's an
interesting question.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I would say, from
what I understand,

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:84%
that's not as likely as some
people might think it is.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're actually
making a regular hybrid-- which

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
isn't the same thing as
an augmented hybrid, which

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.780 align:middle line:84%
you're very much
picking and choosing

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.048 align:middle line:90%
which genetics to go in.

00:12:48.048 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And we'll talk about
what those two are.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but if you really are
just like, OK, this person is--

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:84%
we'll just use an
example and say

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:84%
it's a Zeta Reticulan
and a human,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:84%
already we need to
make a hybrid so

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
that we can communicate
better, so that we

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:90%
have an interactive person.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they basically do
pretty standard breeding--

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:84%
intermixing, so that you end up
with something that's a blend.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And so if a species
was really not like us

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted
to make a hybrid,

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:90%
it would be a real blend.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And unless it
looked just like us,

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:90%
it would look pretty different.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we're talking about
the question if hybrids can get

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
into high positions
in the Earth system,

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:90%
I think that that can happen.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that hybrids
that look totally exotic

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:84%
would have the ability
to blend into the system.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of
hybrids, because they

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.950 align:middle line:84%
have different experiences, they
have different genetic profiles

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and a different set of
skills and skill levels,

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:84%
they pretty easily can maneuver
inside of this Earth system.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So I know that some of the
Grey's hybrids can or have--

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
they naturally find it easier to
rank highly in some positions.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:84%
I also think that some hybrids
contracted by the military

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:84%
or at least working
in the military.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
If we're talking about
totally exotic ones,

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.745 align:middle line:84%
then I think it would be
impossible to blend in.

00:14:35.745 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, they
wouldn't blend in.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's talk about
the definition of what is

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.240 align:middle line:90%
a hybrid--

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad you said the
other one, augmented hybrid,

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:84%
because those are two
different definitions there.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to start?

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, I'll make it as easy
and relatable as possible.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:90%
So I have two children.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I have a daughter
and I have a son.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:90%
My daughter is also a Marine.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
She is an augmented
Marine, like me.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So she has been
genetically mixed

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:90%
and augmented and switched.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So she's an example of a hybrid
augment because of the DNA

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
that they placed
into her strain,

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:90%
like they did into mine.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They're probably not identical,
but they're different, unique.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But that would be
an augmented hybrid.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:84%
My son is the result
of his Sonoran mother

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:90%
and his Terran father.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:90%
And so he's a hybrid.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:90%
He has no augmentations.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:84%
We didn't tinker with
him or mess with him.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:84%
That was just Sonoran
mommy, Terran daddy

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:90%
make hybrid baby boy.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's the perfect
example I can come up

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:90%
with since I have one of each.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Does he look more like
you or more like your wife?

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the last time I saw
him, he was about this big.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So he has his mother's-- well,
he actually has one Sonoran eye

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:90%
and one Terran eye.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So he kind of has his mother's
eye and one of mine, which is--

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.010 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, that won't be too
hard on him as he's growing up.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:84%
But hard to say who we looked
more like, his mom or me,

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:90%
at that age.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So we'll see what happens
when he gets a little older.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And what would your
definition be, Tim,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:84%
of a hybridization of human
or ET, because there are,

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.987 align:middle line:84%
of course, hybrids that
look just like humans,

00:16:18.987 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:90%
but they're hybrids.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe you
can explain that.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never thought about
a definition for that,

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:84%
but I think if a species take
some of their own genetic

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:84%
material and fuses it with a
different natural-occurring

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:90%
material, then we have a hybrid.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:84%
While, as Randy
said it, there can

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:84%
be some artificial
constructed beings,

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
that they can be
stable to exist,

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:84%
that could be a different
definition for a hybrid.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:84%
But in the context
we're talking about,

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's
one species taking

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:84%
their own genetic
material and infusing it

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:90%
into some other species.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I know of clones being
made in the projects.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:84%
What could you elaborate
on that in your experience

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:90%
with clones, Randy and Tim?

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, clone is
basically just a copy.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially a
soulless copy of a person.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that
there is a requirement that

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:84%
is the tiniest, tiniest,
tiniest, tiniest

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.550 align:middle line:84%
fraction of that
person's soul that

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:84%
has to be attached
to the physical body

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:84%
so that the cells duplicate
beyond 32 or 64 or what it is.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.183 align:middle line:90%
So there's a limitation.

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
They won't grow past
that if there isn't

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.650 align:middle line:90%
some piece of a soul in there.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But because it's just a teeny,
teeny, teeny little sliver,

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.965 align:middle line:90%
they don't really have one.

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they're not
considered a person.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
They're not legally
considered a person,

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.130 align:middle line:84%
because they're-- not
a soul inside them.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to be
not very bright.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.750 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be
very undisciplined.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
They can be very
difficult to train,

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:84%
if you're trying to train
a clone to actually fight.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why we ended up
abandoning clone armies,

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:90%
because they're a horrible idea.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:84%
But a clone is
basically just a copy.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:84%
In my case, this is
not my original body.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:84%
My original body
has been destroyed

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.257 align:middle line:84%
because it was beat
up and bruised and old

00:18:14.257 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
so many times that they
had to give me a young one

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.510 align:middle line:90%
and put me back.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.800 align:middle line:90%
So this is a cloned body.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not a clone,
because as soon

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
as they put my soul into
the body, it's now a person.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.420 align:middle line:84%
It's now legally a
person and it's me.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm no longer
considered a clone

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:84%
even though the body
is a cloned body.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So for something to
be considered a clone,

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:84%
it has to have no soul
or consciousness in it.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
If you take a clone and you put
somebody in it, all of a sudden

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.280 align:middle line:84%
it's now classified as a person,
and it's no longer a clone,

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:90%
all right.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, you explained
to me, at one point,

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:84%
about the transformation of
consciousness into the body.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:55.070 align:middle line:84%
So explain to me about
clones and how that all

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:90%
fits into place.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Is there a soul, a
spirit, a consciousness?

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:90%
And how do they do that?

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> At first, we need to
define what is a soul.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
A soul seems to be
a container that

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:84%
collects all the experiences
that an individual

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:84%
consciousness unit collects
over several lifetimes,

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.740 align:middle line:90%
over several other experiences.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And a soul seems
to be something,

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:31.700 align:middle line:84%
that at one point of evolution
of an individual is growing,

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:84%
or it's something
that starts somewhere.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So not every being has a soul,
but it can develop a soul

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that creating
or developing a soul

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:84%
is fairly close
connected to developing

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:58.370 align:middle line:84%
an I-consciousness, which
is where the collection of I

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:90%
as an observer starts.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be the
initial moment where a container

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:90%
or soul starts to grow.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And from every life period
and whatever experience

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:19.100 align:middle line:84%
an AI has and collects, it
all went to the soul container

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and gets integrated into
that and, from that point,

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:84%
decided on where a
soul or an individual

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.590 align:middle line:84%
goes in their
spiritual evolution.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I'm growing a
person and making a clone,

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:90%
or if I'm 3D-printing a person--

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:90%
we didn't get into that yet--

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:43.220 align:middle line:84%
how does this energy
from source or the soul

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:90%
or the consciousness enter?

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Two things.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:90%
First, there are also--

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.400 align:middle line:84%
or at least it's
been said that there

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
seem to be some non-player
characters, which

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:84%
means there are beings
that look like humans

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:90%
which are approachable.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:07.520 align:middle line:84%
You can talk to them, but they
are not consciousness units.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So they have no I, but our own
perception of consciousness

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:90%
seems to fill them.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.620 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is that
invocation or bringing

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:23.660 align:middle line:84%
a soul to an individual
or whatever is

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.230 align:middle line:90%
something that could be done.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So when Randy is talking
about clones having no soul,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and if you put in the
effort and the energy, then

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
my soul and my consciousness
could raise a soul

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.350 align:middle line:90%
in any other being as well.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And the way I understand it, the
reason why, for example, humans

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:84%
are living so closely
together with other species

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.140 align:middle line:84%
is because they
evolved through that.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:90%
So if you have, for example--

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and I know how bad the
situation, for example,

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:84%
in some zoos on
this planet is, I

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:84%
don't think that's the best
habitat for any species.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you have elephants
in zoos that are closely

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.490 align:middle line:84%
in relationship to humans,
they, for example, develop

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:84%
an I-awareness,
which means when you

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
do an experiment on
the ego of elephants--

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.350 align:middle line:84%
you put, for example,
something there,

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and you put a dot on
their face, and you

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.380 align:middle line:84%
have a mirror,
they automatically

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:84%
know, oh, that's
me in the mirror.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to wipe off
whatever color you put on.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:84%
If you have the same species
of elephants in the jungle

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and having no experience and no
connection to humanity at all,

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.380 align:middle line:84%
they tend to attack the
mirror and see something

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:55.860 align:middle line:90%
else inside of that.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So being close
together for species

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:90%
can be benevolent to them.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So they raise their
I-consciousness,

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:90%
and they create a soul.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a pet, like a dog
or something, that you love--

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.710 align:middle line:84%
love, and you connect
to the dog a lot,

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:84%
then this dog totally
benefits from that.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:84%
The soul of the dog
benefits from that.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And the I-consciousness of
the dog benefits from that.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the dog, when it
dies, it has so many experiences

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:32.090 align:middle line:84%
about humans and opening all
the tins and giving food,

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:35.490 align:middle line:84%
which the dog cannot
do that on their own.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the soul feels inspired
in the next evolutionary step

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.740 align:middle line:84%
that it gets
integrated in humanity.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
It becomes, for example, human
and makes this experience

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to open their food
tin for themselves.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, it seems like a
holographic thing that's being

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:57.500 align:middle line:84%
holographically from
you, to me, to Randy,

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.650 align:middle line:90%
to the clone over here.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so it's an
experiencing thing.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:84%
I-awareness needs to be created
in order to have a soul.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But if I project my own
soul into something,

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:84%
then we have the
same natural patterns

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:84%
that the universe did
in the first place,

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.670 align:middle line:84%
because one being that we
all are projected itself

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
into lots and lots of
infinite objects, things,

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:90%
and other forms of life.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a group of people or
extraterrestrials or a faction

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:41.870 align:middle line:84%
or a government that's behind
a specific hybrid program here

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:43.820 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth?

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as far as covert
military space program

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.370 align:middle line:84%
activities are concerned,
the program that's in charge

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
of that-- which
is multinational,

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.920 align:middle line:84%
multi-cooperation, is
called Project Mannequin,

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.820 align:middle line:90%
oddly enough.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So I know that's the program
that manages and sorts

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:90%
all of that.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not sure--

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and as far as I understand,
pretty much everyone

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:90%
participates in that program.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:84%
It's how they make
everything for everybody

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
to clone replication
for all of that.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.487 align:middle line:84%
But it's one program
that's essentially

00:25:15.487 --> 00:25:17.820 align:middle line:84%
at the center of that and
it's called Project Mannequin.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Tim, you had mentioned to me
about the Greys manipulating

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:90%
DNA a long time ago.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of basically
a hybrid program.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you could call it that.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.760 align:middle line:84%
But they have their
own hybrid programs

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.270 align:middle line:84%
where they put
communicative species

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:43.820 align:middle line:84%
as intermediaries on the
planet and also, yeah,

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.120 align:middle line:90%
doing some work for them.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So the agenda
is a positive one.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The agenda is basically
benefiting the Greys and also

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:57.320 align:middle line:84%
benefiting the overall
evolution of the universe,

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:84%
which seems to be a thing for
the Greys in order to gain back

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual and
evolutionary path.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you guys aware of
any extraterrestrials making

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.510 align:middle line:84%
human-looking clones and
being sent down to Earth?

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so the Greys have
a technology that I'm aware

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
of where they basically produce
a human-looking vessel where

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.690 align:middle line:84%
they project their individual
consciousness into that.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:90%
And they can, for example--

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:84%
they also use that in order
to communicate with people

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.450 align:middle line:90%
in a more non-threatening way.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So, again, I don't
know if that is true,

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:41.510 align:middle line:84%
but it has been said to
me that there are beings--

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:84%
human beings on this
planet that do not

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:90%
have obtained an I-awareness.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:middle line:84%
They are looking like
they are autonomously

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.410 align:middle line:90%
moving around and operating.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.460 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to
be empty vessels.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there
are some species that

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:84%
use those empty vessels and
project their own awareness

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.280 align:middle line:84%
inside of them, probably
like looking through a glass

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:84%
window or something
and then controlling

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:90%
the human that is there.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it upregulating that human
to a higher consciousness when

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:90%
they do that?

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>> No, well, it seems that
there are some humans--

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:26.727 align:middle line:90%
let's call them humans.

00:27:26.727 --> 00:27:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know... they
look like humans,

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:84%
but they're basically non-aware
bodies in order to fill up

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:90%
the space of the universe.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if that is
true, but this is something

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:90%
that I've been told.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And some species use
those empty vessels

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:84%
because they do
not have a free--

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.780 align:middle line:84%
well, they could
have a free will,

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:90%
if they have an I-awareness.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But they do not
have an I-awareness.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And they project their own
I-awareness inside of them

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and can use them for a temporal
purpose for a short time

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:84%
in order to maneuver
around the Earth

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and in order to
interact with people.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think, Randy?

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the technical word for
that is called teleoperation.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, if
a being of any type

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.940 align:middle line:84%
is sitting in a chair that's
essentially the control

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:24.650 align:middle line:84%
mechanism and then chooses
either a mechanical, biological

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:84%
drone, which could be a clone
body, could be a human body,

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:84%
could be an alien body, could
be a robot, anything at all,

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:84%
is basically remote controlling
or using sensory collection

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
hear, see everything

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:84%
that the drone is
essentially experiencing

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.160 align:middle line:90%
that's called teleoperation.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And we use it, ETs have used
it forever and ever and ever.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, there are some
of these sort of empty vessels

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:52.700 align:middle line:84%
that they used for
that and just pop down

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:84%
when they need to use it,
drive it around for a minute,

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.710 align:middle line:84%
use it to talk, make something,
and then turn off, cut

00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.510 align:middle line:90%
the signal.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, in some
cases, these sort

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.240 align:middle line:84%
of soulless people then just
continuing about their lives.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but it's
teleoperation, absolutely.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, it's one of the
most common ways in which we've

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.100 align:middle line:84%
been doing more recently
and other species interact

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:20.480 align:middle line:84%
with other worlds without the
cross contamination of biology,

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.750 align:middle line:84%
which bacteria, viruses,
and all of that.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Really, the simplest way to do
that is not to wear a spacesuit

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.800 align:middle line:84%
but to actually use a
teleoperated body that

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.010 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to come back
through decontamination.

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>> How would you recognize
a soulless human being?

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, the eyes for sure,
looking into the eyes.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.450 align:middle line:90%
The eyes are just hollow.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.190 align:middle line:84%
They're just hollow,
hollow empty eyes.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> We call them eight balls.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:46.848 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's a
good word for it.

00:29:46.848 --> 00:29:48.015 align:middle line:90%
>> We call them eight balls.

00:29:48.015 --> 00:29:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, hollow, empty eyes.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes you'll see
it, just for a second,

00:29:51.117 --> 00:29:55.200 align:middle line:84%
where the eye will go completely
black for just a second.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.810 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes back to normal.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we truly see each
other's souls through the eyes.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And so when there's nothing
there-- the lights are on,

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:84%
no one's home, yeah,
they're empty, hollow.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, also, because
we have this effect where we

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.930 align:middle line:84%
project our own
awareness several meters,

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:19.800 align:middle line:84%
or even at large distances
when we're trained,

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:28.590 align:middle line:84%
that it's sometimes you meet
somebody and this person

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:34.170 align:middle line:84%
interacts with you just in the
way you want things to turn

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:39.390 align:middle line:84%
out, and I think that this
is a sign of significance

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:43.740 align:middle line:84%
for an indicator for
projecting your own awareness

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:47.320 align:middle line:84%
into an empty vessel
that then reacts upon it,

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.350 align:middle line:90%
which has no I-awareness.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that could be an
indicator for finding that out.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you guys believe these
hybrids and clones on Earth are

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.680 align:middle line:90%
here to do what?

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say the largest
percentage of what

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:84%
they're for is passive
intelligence or communication.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are not used
for military purposes

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.160 align:middle line:84%
or to kill someone
or be an assassin

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.220 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Most of it's passive
intelligence gathering

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.390 align:middle line:90%
or communication, I would say.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.108 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that it couldn't
be used for another purpose

00:31:22.108 --> 00:31:23.650 align:middle line:84%
or something that
was a little scary,

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:84%
but I think
percentages-wise, you're

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.590 align:middle line:84%
talking about something
that presents a very, very

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:32.250 align:middle line:84%
low tangible threat to
any people whatsoever,

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:84%
let alone the species or
civilization at large.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there are a lot of
extraterrestrial programs with

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
hybrids and clones doing
this here on planet Earth?

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean doing it on
the surface of Earth?

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.470 align:middle line:84%
They could be making them
anywhere and then placing them

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.730 align:middle line:90%
here on the planet.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And for what reason,
for what agenda?

00:31:55.670 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, so as Randy
already said, put it correctly,

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:06.950 align:middle line:84%
many of those programs about
hybrids is to communicate with

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:84%
species or doing some parts
in benefit for the mission

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:14.760 align:middle line:90%
of the species.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.280 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, that's totally--

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they relaying
information back to these

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.570 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials?

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And who are these
extraterrestrials

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:26.810 align:middle line:84%
involved with these
hybrid clone programs?

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>> We find that the more we
look into these programs,

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.960 align:middle line:84%
the more we discover
these programs,

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:84%
the more our intelligence
networks tracks down unofficial

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.680 align:middle line:84%
presence, unofficial
activity, essentially

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.352 align:middle line:84%
if you're an extraterrestrial
and you're in the solar system

00:32:43.352 --> 00:32:45.560 align:middle line:84%
or you're within the Terran
sphere and you don't have

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.738 align:middle line:84%
your paperwork, you're
unauthorized to be here

00:32:48.738 --> 00:32:50.030 align:middle line:90%
or doing whatever you're doing.

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So we've been going through
the process of investigating,

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.210 align:middle line:84%
identifying, tracking down the
people without their papers,

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.772 align:middle line:84%
that they're not supposed
to be acting here,

00:32:58.772 --> 00:33:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and mostly shutting them down
as we go through the process.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
But what we're finding
is a majority of them

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.240 align:middle line:84%
are programs run
by other species

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:13.070 align:middle line:84%
to do what they think is
upgrading or helping people.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.570 align:middle line:90%
What we do find is--

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I've had a couple of
cases of people who've

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:84%
been dealing directly
with these species

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and then tinkering that they've
been doing with them-- is some

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:26.550 align:middle line:84%
of these species are a
little arrogant in the sense

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that they think no, no,
no, no, we're helping you.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:30.900 align:middle line:90%
We know we're helping you.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.370 align:middle line:90%
It's good what we're doing.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:35.113 align:middle line:84%
You don't understand it,
but we're helping you.

00:33:35.113 --> 00:33:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And then their way that they're
seeing what they're doing,

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:39.090 align:middle line:84%
they think they're
really helping.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.880 align:middle line:84%
But what we've had
to say is, look,

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate that you
think you're helping.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any idea what you're
putting this person through?

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any idea how
much trauma, emotional and

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:84%
psychological scarring
you're giving to this person

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:90%
to help them?

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.160 align:middle line:90%
No, you're doing it wrong.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And we have the ability to
tell people in these programs

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.340 align:middle line:90%
to stop and to cease and desist.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole process
for issuing cease and desist

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.460 align:middle line:84%
orders, which what we're finding
sometimes works right away.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.245 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes still
it's like, well,

00:34:11.245 --> 00:34:13.870 align:middle line:84%
all right, we'll comply with the
cease and desist for a moment.

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.503 align:middle line:90%
But we still know better.

00:34:15.503 --> 00:34:17.170 align:middle line:84%
We still-- we know
we're really helping.

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And what we've
also found is then

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:22.540 align:middle line:84%
when we deal directly
with the programs

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.830 align:middle line:84%
after three or four
cease and desists, we go,

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:84%
all right, we're
going above your head

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:29.139 align:middle line:84%
to your chain of command,
to your superiors.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And often when we
go to them, we find

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.020 align:middle line:84%
that these are rogue,
covert programs

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that the people in charge
of know nothing about.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.853 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
that they're operating.

00:34:36.853 --> 00:34:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you have mentioned
to me in the past, Randy,

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:84%
on a few occasions, that you did
capture rogue cloned and hybrid

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:84%
programmed people that were
doing nefarious activities

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and that there are actually
teams out there that are

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:56.530 align:middle line:90%
actually made for this

00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, there are very
specific teams that their job

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:84%
is to investigate, track, and in
some cases hunt down, capture,

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.710 align:middle line:90%
or search and destroy.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we have some very
good people on top of that.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Like any criminal
investigation process,

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.650 align:middle line:84%
you have a filtering
process of every case

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that pops up, how severe
is it, how bad is it,

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.310 align:middle line:84%
how many people are
being affected by it.

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So we prioritize and go
after the worst offenders

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and often, again, try to go
through the process of issuing

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:84%
cease and desists
so that we don't

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:84%
have to look like
we're being thugs,

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.427 align:middle line:84%
because the intergalactic
community looks

00:35:31.427 --> 00:35:32.260 align:middle line:90%
at what we're doing.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.927 align:middle line:84%
And when we just bang
people on the head

00:35:33.927 --> 00:35:37.330 align:middle line:84%
without using the legal process,
they shake their finger at us.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But oh, yeah, there's
definitely some people

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:43.510 align:middle line:84%
whose job it is to hunt those
people down and remove them

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.710 align:middle line:90%
if necessary.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We have been talking
about extraterrestrials,

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.750 align:middle line:84%
for most part of the show,
with clones and hybrids.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.840 align:middle line:84%
But are you guys aware of
any corporations or military,

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:84%
government, political
entities, that are making

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:03.750 align:middle line:90%
clones for their own agendas?

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so it's banned across
military intelligence programs.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So military
intelligence programs

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.440 align:middle line:84%
are not supposed to
be making clones.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.570 align:middle line:84%
From our experience,
we've also understood

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that they're a waste of
money, for the most part.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:21.640 align:middle line:84%
You can't train clone armies
or clone soldiers very well.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So there are
probably not too many

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.660 align:middle line:84%
rogue military intelligence
programs at the time.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I would say the worst
offender of that

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.770 align:middle line:84%
are private contractor
and corporate programs.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't give a crap about
what things they're messing

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:39.600 align:middle line:84%
with beyond their kin
that they shouldn't be.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So mostly it's
corporate programs

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.790 align:middle line:84%
who are looking for the
cheapest, most effective use

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.880 align:middle line:90%
of body power-- man power.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Or growing bodies just
to use their organs for--

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, organ harvesting.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:53.790 align:middle line:90%
--organ harvesting.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Tim, as we wrap
this episode up, do

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.790 align:middle line:84%
you see a time
where there's going

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:03.360 align:middle line:84%
to be humans and hybrids,
and possibly even clones,

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:90%
living together in the future?

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one thing is for sure
that the different influences

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.560 align:middle line:84%
that people have on this
planet coming from different

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:84%
manipulative species probably
has resulted in a situation

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.390 align:middle line:90%
rich in conflict.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the racial problems
that people have on Earth, I'd

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:35.940 align:middle line:84%
say comes also from
the different species

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and different subspecies and
manipulations that we have.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:47.250 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that the planet
is learning more and more how

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:51.060 align:middle line:84%
to come together, that species,
even if we look different

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.470 align:middle line:90%
or have different--

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.600 align:middle line:84%
coming from different
regions of the world,

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.710 align:middle line:84%
having different backgrounds,
that we're all together here.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I assume that,
because a lot of hybrids

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.550 align:middle line:84%
have been placed here
in order to communicate

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and in order to approach a more
open scenario of communication,

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.080 align:middle line:84%
that this will
eventually be something

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.980 align:middle line:84%
that every planet and
the whole universe

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:90%
will experience in some time.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>> In the advancement
of disclosure,

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.880 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
would help more?

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Would it be the
extraterrestrials, the hybrids

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:32.500 align:middle line:90%
and clones?

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.940 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the majority of
hybrids are put here in order

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.610 align:middle line:84%
to initiate some
kind of contact,

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:48.880 align:middle line:84%
so putting hybrids on this
planet is an approach in order

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.938 align:middle line:90%
to get--

00:38:50.938 --> 00:38:52.605 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like the first
step to getting--

00:38:52.605 --> 00:38:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a first step, yes.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I also think that,
in contrast to that,

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:04.090 align:middle line:84%
it would be more beneficial
to the soul of humans,

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:07.720 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, to
actually experience

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.590 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
non-terrestrial being.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:15.700 align:middle line:84%
The best it would be, because
we talked about correlationism,

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:20.440 align:middle line:84%
which means the best would be
contact with a humanoid species

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:27.670 align:middle line:84%
that is a little different,
a little different

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:33.460 align:middle line:84%
to what people on Earth
are, but still relatable.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
would be the best.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, maybe because
hybrids can be that,

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:41.890 align:middle line:90%
so this could be a scenario.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, what do
you think, Randy?

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it could be helpful.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:54.340 align:middle line:84%
But my concern is that creating
other racial species variations

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.540 align:middle line:84%
just makes for more things
for certain people to hate.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.710 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not sure.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.657 align:middle line:84%
That's not a blanket
answer to say

00:40:01.657 --> 00:40:03.490 align:middle line:84%
that just because you
have hybrids or aliens

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.210 align:middle line:84%
that everyone is
going to be accepted.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Definitely a
possibility, for sure.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think
it's a possibility.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
to agree, though,

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:12.370 align:middle line:84%
that the most human-like,
just a little different,

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:16.160 align:middle line:84%
is really the best stepping
stone transition to that.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest,
I'd be concerned

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.493 align:middle line:84%
for some of their hybrid
safety and well-being.

00:40:21.493 --> 00:40:24.160 align:middle line:84%
If people started to talk about,
oh, there's hybrids everywhere.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.035 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that could make some
of them very unsafe.

00:40:26.035 --> 00:40:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I could see already
laws being made just for them,

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.100 align:middle line:90%
political things.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Or certainly turning into
some kind of politicization

00:40:32.665 --> 00:40:33.550 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the best way is to
have a humanoid species that is

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:45.280 align:middle line:84%
exotic enough to realize we are
not alone, but still relatable.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that would be the key.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Agreed.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally agreed.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you, guys,
for being on the show.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
having you, as always.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Emery Smith.

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:58.510 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:01.670 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Lifeforms exist that are
totally disconnected from every

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:14.530 align:middle line:84%
definition of a biological,
3D lifeform that we are aware

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:15.330 align:middle line:90%
of here.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>> They were different than
us, biologically different.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:90%
The technology was different.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:24.380 align:middle line:84%
The Vatican came and witnessed
the landing and the exchange.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.450 align:middle line:90%
And these were EBENs.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Possibly, it's close to
infinity how many species

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and how many lifeforms
are out there.
