>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:10%
we're with Ricardo Gonzalez,
author and researcher from Peru

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:10%
who has experienced
multiple direct contacts

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:10%
with an extraterrestrial
species called the Apunians.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Today we are talking about
the myth of Shambhala.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.512 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.512 --> 00:00:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICARDO GONZALEZ CORPANCHO:
Thank you again, Emery.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is
the Shambhala myth,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.578 align:middle line:90%
and where is it taking place?

>>GONZALEZ CORPANCHO
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I confess that this is one of
the most fascinating topics I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
have researched and that I
am deeply passionate about.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Shambhala is the name of a
supposed lost city in Asia.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
It is a very important
place for Buddhism.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Some Lamas think that Shambhala
is not exactly a hidden city,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:84%
but rather a
spiritual realm where

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
the great masters of
Earth's history live,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.890 align:middle line:84%
a place of peace,
a temple of peace.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Sanskrit name
Shambhala means place of peace.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.292 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where did
it originate from?

00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ CORPANCHO
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.930 align:middle line:84%
It is thought that the
origin of Shambhala

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is in Tibet or some
Himalayan country.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:84%
However, according
to my research,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
the origin is in Mongolia in
the heart of the Gobi Desert.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
There's an ancient
tradition in the Gobi Desert

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:84%
that speaks of beings
who came from Heaven,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.720 align:middle line:84%
great minds who trained ancient
humans in spiritual knowledge.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Then everything would have
been born in the Gobi Desert.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And from this
information, knowledge

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
traveled towards the Tibetan
Plateau, Northern India,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and other Asian countries,
a knowledge that

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:90%
affected the West much later.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:84%
When multiple European
explorers delved

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
into the culture of the East
and tried to obtain knowledge

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:84%
from the East to take to the
West, concepts such as karma,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:84%
reincarnation,
meditation, energies,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
they took from these
ancient cultures of the East

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
to share with the
world, sometimes

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong way, taking
these Eastern teachings wildly

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:90%
out of context.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But it was part of a program,
a spiritual program called

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:90%
the diffusion of Shambhala.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:84%
The diffusion of
Shambhala is not just

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
about revealing the existence
of this supposed lost city,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
but also of the
knowledge it represents.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is of
great interest to me

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
because it has a common thread
with the experience in Peru

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.460 align:middle line:84%
from everything I learned in
shamanic circles in my country.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.460 align:middle line:84%
According to one of the messages
of the extraterrestrials,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Shambhala was the
first peace shrine

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
in the world that
was established

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:84%
after the last destruction
that our planet experienced.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:84%
This destruction,
spoken of by some

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:84%
of the masters of
ancient Greece,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:84%
as in the case of the
Great philosopher Plato,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:84%
they called the fall of
Atlantis, which by the way

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
is not knowledge
exclusive to the Greeks.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks took that
information from the Egyptians.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Probably the Egyptians from
previous civilizations.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.970 align:middle line:84%
The Lamas with whom I
have spent time in Asia

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
speak of the same
destruction, of something

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.600 align:middle line:84%
incredible and deplorable
that happened on our planet

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Great destruction, floods,
and entire civilizations

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:90%
disappeared.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.850 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge of
these civilizations,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Lamas, was gathered

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
by the beings of Heaven,
and with that they

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:90%
founded Shambhala.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Then the teachings that
emerged from Shambhala,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.330 align:middle line:84%
according to this
legend, were gathered

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:90%
in the first temples of Asia.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Today this
information is hidden.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
They are not found
in the temples

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:84%
that a tourist would
visit in Northern India.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Wasn't there a
connection with Shambhala

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.037 align:middle line:84%
and the famous Russian
artist Nicholas Roerich?

>>GONZALEZ CORPANCHO
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:04:23.745 --> 00:04:26.340 align:middle line:10%
Nicholas Roerich
in my opinion has

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.460 align:middle line:10%
been the most important
disseminator of the Shambhala

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:10%
myth.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.160 align:middle line:84%
This information from Shambhala
has reached many countries

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.430 align:middle line:84%
thanks to Roerich's
expeditions in Central Asia.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.610 align:middle line:90%
We have to go back to the 1920.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas Roerich was one
of the first Westerners

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
after Marco Polo to
enter these cultures.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And Roerich was looking
for Shambhala, and not

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:84%
exactly the city, but the
information, the knowledge.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:84%
The expeditions of this Russian
visual artist and philosopher

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:90%
were scientific and cultural.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:84%
In his native Russia, he had
seen a tremendous neglect

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:84%
of museums, cultural,
and archaeological sites,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and he had introduced himself to
mystical and spiritual subjects

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:90%
to the esoterism of his time.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.470 align:middle line:84%
He then undertook a great
expedition to Central Asia,

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.900 align:middle line:84%
touring incredible
and fascinating places

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.150 align:middle line:84%
in Tibet, Nepal,
Mongolia, China,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
India where he was able
to map out sights that

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:90%
were previously unknown to us.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
In these expeditions, he
had the advice and company

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
of several Lamas who
mentioned that Shambhala

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
was not just a myth,
but something real,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and that there were beings
living in Shambhala.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.097 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there a connection
between the ETs and Shambhala?

00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:01.805 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ CORPANCHO
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:06:01.805 --> 00:06:06.890 align:middle line:84%
For example, in 1927 during
Nicolas Roerich's expedition

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
through the mountains of
Tibet, a golden object

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:90%
appeared in the sky.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:90%
The whole expedition stopped.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.230 align:middle line:84%
The animal stood still
and a very pleasant aroma

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:84%
like the most exquisite incense
imbued the entire place.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.810 align:middle line:84%
They took out binoculars
to observe the object.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:84%
They saw that it was
metallic in appearance

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and that it reflected
the sunlight.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:84%
It made an incredibly fast
change of movement and left.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Then Nicholas Roerich
asked the Lamas who

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:90%
accompanied him, what was that?

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Lamas answered,
a sign of Shambhala.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics tried to say that
what Nicholas Roerich saw

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:84%
had just been some
weather balloons

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.570 align:middle line:84%
that an expedition from
Switzerland was using nearby.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But then they understood
that this was impossible,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.000 align:middle line:84%
first because the
Swiss expedition was

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.300 align:middle line:84%
500 miles from the site
and those balloons were

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:84%
too small to be seen, and they
only had a range of 100 miles

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:90%
before bursting.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And what Nicholas Roerich saw
was something big, huge, moving

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:90%
at top speed intelligently.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And most disturbingly,
Emery, an object

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
that the Lamas were
already familiar with.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.450 align:middle line:84%
When I've been in the Gobi
Desert with the Lamas,

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:90%
they were used to UFO sightings.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And they said to us
through the translator

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
who we take, the people
who walk in the sky, who

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
move in those lights
protect the entrance

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.400 align:middle line:90%
to the subterranean world.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:84%
In that underground
world are the survivors

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
of previous cultures
that humanity currently

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:90%
considers a myth.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And the descendants of those
cultures lost in the past

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:84%
are the current
masters of Shambhala.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And if this were not
enough, Nicholas Roerich

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:84%
had contact with
those human beings

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:90%
of the underground world.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:10%
According to my research
in Central Asia,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:10%
the contact was not in
Tibet, but in Mongolia

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:10%
in the Altai Mountain range.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:10%
These mountains stretch
from China and Mongolia

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:10%
to Siberia and Russia.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was in Mongolia
where Nicholas Roerich

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:84%
had this close encounter
in the Mongolian section

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.940 align:middle line:90%
of this mountain range.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:84%
He entered into a grotto
there inside a cave

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:90%
and he met human beings like us.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:84%
They were not extraterrestrial
entities, but humans.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:84%
As I said, descendants
of forgotten

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.850 align:middle line:84%
lost cultures who are part of
a subterranean secret society.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And in some esoteric circles
it is known as the Great White

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Brotherhood.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Beside the fact that esoterism
can confuse this information,

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
it is based on a
real experience.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle line:84%
These physical guardians
of secret entrances

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:84%
to the underground world are in
contact with the crews of UFOs.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:84%
For that reason, the
Lamas said, that object

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.890 align:middle line:90%
is a sign of the Shambhala.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to
remember a small detail.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I'm describing
is in Roerich's diaries,

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.610 align:middle line:84%
at least as far as the
UFO sighting is concerned.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And I would emphasize
in 1927, 20 years

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
before the beginning of the
modern era of UFOs, Nicholas

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Roerich was here in
the United States.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
He brought all the information
from his expeditions

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and contact and created
a worldwide movement,

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:84%
because according to the
beings who contacted Roerich,

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
humans had to make great
efforts to protect the Earth's

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:84%
places of knowledge from
museums, temples, anything that

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:84%
involves genius and
human knowledge,

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:84%
to the natural sanctuaries of
the world that must prevail.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:10%
It was an extraordinary message
from these masters which

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:10%
Roerich managed to get the
United States to sign on

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:10%
in 1935 with President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt. This became

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:10%
known as the Roerich
Covenant to protect

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:10%
the places of the Earth.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:10%
For people who are watching
us now and become aware

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.430 align:middle line:10%
of the importance of what
I'm saying, when UNESCO says,

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:10%
for example, that Machu
Picchu in my country

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:10%
is a cultural
heritage of humanity,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:10%
it is based on the Roerich pact.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that the UNESCO
protocol for the protection

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
of cultural sites is based on
a close encounter of Nicolas

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Roerich.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Even many people who
were very involved

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.890 align:middle line:84%
with the Banner
of Peace movement

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:90%
are unaware of this background.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the symbol of
the Banner of Peace,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:10%
a circle with
another three circles

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:10%
concentrated in the middle,
this is a cosmic symbol,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:10%
the symbol of the
founders of Shambhala,

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:10%
which is known in Central
Asia as the Cintamani stone.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
The stone is capable of
making your dreams come true

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:84%
because that symbol represents
a rock that came from the cosmos

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:84%
to Earth from Orion and stood
on top of a tower in Shambhala.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.140 align:middle line:84%
It was separated into
three small fragments

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and it secretly
toured the world.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
This symbol represents
very profound things,

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and Nicholas Roerich used it
to create this banner of peace,

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:84%
changing its meaning
a little for people.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.410 align:middle line:84%
The three inner
circles represent

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:84%
the union of art,
science, and spirituality.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But it is nonetheless
the stone of Cintamani,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.530 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Grail of
Orion, so to speak,

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
which was in the
original Shambhala.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:12.480 align:middle line:84%
There are many things that have
happened in contact experiences

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:84%
that unite the myth of Shambhala
and the extraterrestrials,

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and which today have become
very accepted on a human level.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:84%
It is common to see
Roerich's Banner of Peace

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:84%
at a UNESCO or
United Nations event.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
If they only knew that it is
an extraterrestrial symbol.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are these ET
beings of Shambhala

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
influencing the Earth
and the universe today?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ CORPANCHO THROUGH
INTERPRETER: Absolutely, Emery.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Emery, we were talking
about a conflict of forces

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
on Earth and that
human beings are

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
this war of time.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned to you that some
researchers concentrated

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:84%
solely and exclusively
on negative experiences

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:90%
for the human species.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.950 align:middle line:84%
As I told you, there were
also positive influences

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:90%
to try to balance the scales.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And this has to be
so for human beings

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:90%
to find their middle ground.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Look, for example, at what
happened to Nicholas Roerich

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:84%
from his close encounter
in the Altai Mountains

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and his expedition
through Central Asia.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.980 align:middle line:84%
The Banner of Peace
movement was born.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:84%
From a contact, the catalyst
for world peace was born.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Isn't this a positive influence?

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.120 align:middle line:84%
In the time of Nicholas
Roerich, other individuals

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:84%
who lived according
to Eastern wisdom

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:84%
came here to the United States
to share that knowledge.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:84%
It was part of a plan
because the United States

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.070 align:middle line:84%
is the most influential
country in the world,

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:84%
making decisions that
affect the entire globe.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And it is important for
America to become spiritual.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, in
addition to Nicholas Roerich,

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:84%
there were individuals like
Krishnamurti and Paramahansa

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Yogananda who conveyed the
same spiritual concepts.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:84%
They lectured and
filled entire theaters,

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
because there was a lot of
spiritual thirst for knowledge

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, and
that legacy continues today.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:90%
It is the program of Shambhala.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:84%
It is a positive
influence, as I hope

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.350 align:middle line:84%
this interview will be for the
people who are watching us.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Now then, these beings who
try to positively influence

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:84%
the culture of light on Earth
cannot intervene directly

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:90%
in our affairs.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:90%
They should not.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.600 align:middle line:84%
They only try to plant
possibilities in us

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
through knowledge, which allows
us to make better decisions.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So it is preferable
that we connect

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:84%
with these positive
influences of culture,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and as humans make appropriate
and fair decisions.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you suggesting
that these spiritual influences

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:90%
are from ETs?

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ CORPANCHO THROUGH
INTERPRETER: Not necessarily.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking of the ancient
knowledge that was in Asia,

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:90%
but unknown to the West.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I call this knowledge from Asia
the Shambhala Consciousness

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Program.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And some individuals-- like I
mentioned, Nicholas Roerich--

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.580 align:middle line:84%
were part of this plan
for this knowledge

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:84%
to migrate to the
West, especially

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:90%
to the United States.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Now having said
that, it is likely

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.990 align:middle line:84%
that some ancient
knowledge of Asia linked

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:84%
to the legend of Shambhala,
or the knowledge of Shambhala

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:84%
may have been stimulated by
contact with extraterrestrials.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, in India
there's a legend

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that the practice of mantras
was a gift from the gods.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of the
movie "Close Encounters

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Third Kind" where
in the North of India

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:84%
in the town of Dharamshala
people are chanting a mantra.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.690 align:middle line:84%
[CHANTING] And that
mantra was created

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:18.180 align:middle line:84%
as a result of a sound
that came from the sky,

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.340 align:middle line:90%
the sound produced by a ship.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And this sound, as
we all remember,

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:84%
became the famous
theme song of the film.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Beyond Spielberg's film, these
things have happened in reality

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and have emerged from knowledge
of contact experiences.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in India these
things are no exception.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what is the
connection between Shambhala

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.507 align:middle line:90%
and the stars?

00:16:43.507 --> 00:16:45.215 align:middle line:10%
>>GONZALEZ CORPANCHO
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:16:45.215 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:10%
I think I should go back to the
explanation of the Cintamani

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.325 align:middle line:10%
stone, because
according to legend,

00:16:52.325 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:10%
Cintamani came to Shambhala
from the Orion stellar sector.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Orion once again.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
According to this
information, in the universe

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.050 align:middle line:90%
there are crystals of power.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:84%
According to the
extraterrestrials,

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:84%
when our universe became
physical as we perceived it,

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:84%
energy arose from other
nonphysical planes of reality.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:90%
It materialized.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:90%
It densified.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And these crystals have
very powerful properties

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:84%
because it is as if they coexist
in this and another world,

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:84%
in the world of matter
and in the subtle world.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.220 align:middle line:90%
One of these mother stones--

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.070 align:middle line:90%
we will call it that--

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth as a
part of a mission

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:84%
brought by
extraterrestrial entities,

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.210 align:middle line:84%
always according to the
information that these beings

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.080 align:middle line:90%
have given us.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And with that stone they founded
Shambhala, as we discussed.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And something more interesting,
in India and Tibet,

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:84%
especially in Mongolia,
this mother stone

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
is called by the
Sanskrit word Cintamani.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Cinta means thought and
mani, precious jewel.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So Cintamani means
the stone or jewel

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:84%
of thought, a kind
of cosmic tool.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
For all humans who
come close to it,

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:84%
it enhances their
capabilities for cocreation.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:84%
It is Shambhala's connection
to a secret knowledge

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.650 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because this green stone--

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and for the first
time I'm mentioning

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:84%
the color that this stone
had, according to legend--

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:84%
it reminds me of a legend
in South America from very

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:58.200 align:middle line:84%
ancestral peoples in the
Andes, in Ecuador especially,

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:90%
who called this stone umiña.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Umiña means emerald in
their native language.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:09.100 align:middle line:90%
Umiña could heal people.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Not that it was an emerald.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:90%
It was green like an emerald.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are many myths in
this world relating to this.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
There's another very important
myth from the Middle Ages

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:84%
that speaks of the legend
of the Holy Grail, that

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:30.040 align:middle line:84%
says that after a war of angels
in Heaven, from Lucifer's

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:84%
forehead an emerald falls,
a green stone like the myth

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.780 align:middle line:90%
of Cintamani in Central Asia.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And when that green
stone comes to Earth,

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
it becomes the mythical
chalice of Christ

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:90%
that is used in the Last Supper.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Behind all these myths
there is a secret knowledge

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and a symbol, cosmic and
powerful, cocreating,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
which Nicholas Roerich
knew how to place

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.220 align:middle line:90%
on his banner of peace.

>>GONZALEZ CORPANCHO THROUGH
INTERPRETER: Initially

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.430 align:middle line:84%
the stone was in the Gobi
Desert, and the three fragments

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.950 align:middle line:84%
that are always moving
around the world,

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:84%
we do not currently know
where they are located,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:90%
but we know where they were.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, we know that
one of these fragments

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:84%
was on Easter Island in
Rapa Nui in Polynesia.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Legend has it that on
this Polynesian island

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:84%
in the Pacific a
very powerful energy

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:84%
was deposited inside a
volcano, the energy of mana.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But not the mana of
the Hebrew people

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:84%
that is mentioned
in the Bible, which

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:51.230 align:middle line:84%
allowed them to live on this
food that fell from Heaven,

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.840 align:middle line:84%
but an energy that some
Rapa Nui traditions mention

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:84%
as a bright green
vibration, an energy that

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:84%
brought the statues to life
on Easter Island, called moai.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
many interpretations.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But there is a consensus on the
existence of this magical force

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:90%
called mana.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:84%
It is probably related to
these energies or forces

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
origin or a connection

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:90%

THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a very
powerful message behind it.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I made such a commitment
to this message

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:84%
that I joined the
Roerich movement

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:84%
to spread the message of
consciousness, of peace.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I call this process
the discovery

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.170 align:middle line:90%
of your inner Shambhala.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.180 align:middle line:84%

all this experience

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
contact in Peru,

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I was more fascinated
by external experiences,

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:90%
by the phenomenon.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:84%
That was logical,
but over time I

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:84%
discovered that these
beings were right

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:84%
when we are told again and again
that the main contact you must

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:84%
reach is not with us but with
yourselves, because personal

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and internal contact opens
the doors of the universe.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.240 align:middle line:90%
We can make mistakes.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.890 align:middle line:90%
We are human.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:90%
But you have to try.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And I call that the
inner Shambhala.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Shambhala means
the place of peace,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:90%
the place of tranquility.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.980 align:middle line:90%
So find your inner Shambhala.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.340 align:middle line:84%
It is to find that
point of nonconflict,

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:90%
the point of nonresistance.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:84%

by extraterrestrial entities.
