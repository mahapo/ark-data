00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:12.818 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:19.750 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, I'm Emery Smith.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.500 align:middle line:10%
And on today's program, we
have a very special guest.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:10%
His name is David Adair.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:10%
David, welcome to the show.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you for having me.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.955 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, today, we're going
to be talking about the catch

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:10%
and release programs, such as
the ones Betty and Barney Hill

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:10%
went through, and also other
friends of yours that you may

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:10%
know of.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's-- golly, I know
more about this than I really

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:90%
want to know.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Normally I've heard from
groups that when people have

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:84%
encounter with Grays,
mostly positive,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and there's some interaction,
and that's pretty much it.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:84%
The one that I
really know about,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:84%
the person who went
through it, is close to me.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So I know the story is true, and
I was around when it occurred.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was anything
but positive.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:90%
It was really, really negative.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:90%
But the effects were profound.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did the encounter take
place, and how old were they?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's see.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:90%
He was 13.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And it took place in North
Carolina and out in a field.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So it was isolated
and the perfect place

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:84%
for a close encounter
of the third kind.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So this person had the encounter
with gray-like type figures.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Were there others present,
other extraterrestrial races

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:90%
in these events?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in his encounter, there
were three different types.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.600 align:middle line:90%
They had the big bug thing.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.000 align:middle line:10%
And then they had Grays.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.940 align:middle line:10%
And then there were these
other three that he described.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:90%
They were one male, one female--

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
very tall, white robes, long,
blond hair, and Nordic-looking.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, God, were
they Vikings, you know?

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he said,
looked like Vikings.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I went, did they appear
to be in command?

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:90%
He goes, yeah.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.430 align:middle line:10%
They were the ones
giving orders.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:90%
To who?

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.140 align:middle line:90%
To the Grays.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, what were
the big bug things?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I think they
were guards, perimeters.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.085 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, once again,
he's making logic sense again.

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, making sense.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's frustrating
because this boy is anything

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:90%
but logical.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But the answers are
so logic-driven.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, man, what
is going on with this kid?

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And the next day,
changes started.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of changes?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Were they physical?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> His mother thought he
had turned on the radio.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.580 align:middle line:90%
And it was a piano playing.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.057 align:middle line:84%
So she goes, well, that
radio is really clear.

00:02:57.057 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, she also played the piano.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
piano in the house.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:90%
So this boy never played piano.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:90%
Never had a lesson, nothing.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So she goes around the corner
and looks in the living room,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
drops her dishes
that she's doing,

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:84%
because that boy is
pounding on the piano.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
He's-- is what she
thought was a radio.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:90%
He's playing all the masters--

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.523 align:middle line:90%
Beethoven, Bach, Tchaikovsky.

00:03:26.523 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Did she approach him and
say, what are you doing?

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:84%
She goes, how are
you doing this?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:90%
I can just play.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:90%
So she's a pragmatic mom.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:90%
So she calls a piano teacher.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And the piano teacher comes
over and sits down with the boy.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And the boy is sitting there
with her on the piano bench.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And she starts playing
chopsticks, you know.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:90%
And he's looking at her.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.545 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
you do the first part.

00:03:58.545 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it's kind of blasÃ©.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And he starts playing
his chopsticks.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:90%
And he's pounding away at it.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And then she asked him,
can you do anything else?

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
He breaks into,
you know, Beethoven

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:90%
and breaks into Mozart.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And so she jumps up, and
she's mad as a wet hornet--

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>> He's better than her.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> --and goes back to
mother and tells her,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't have time for
this kind of crap.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:90%
He's a child prodigy.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't you tell me that?

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Send him over to the
local university.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Let the professors look at him.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So they took him over
to the local university.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And the professor
of music's there.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:90%
And he sets him down on a piano.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And he watches
him start playing.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.095 align:middle line:90%
And the professor is amazed.

00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:90%
The boy is only, like, 13.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:84%
But he's pounding
out the masters,

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:84%
the old masters of piano, till
that thing's about smoking.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, have you ever
tried playing anything else?

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, never
had the opportunity.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So he reaches over and
hands him a clarinet.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:90%
He goes blowing on that thing.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.890 align:middle line:90%
He gives him a trumpet.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Man, can he play a trumpet.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:90%
He then gave him a flute.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.300 align:middle line:90%
And he plays it flawlessly.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:90%
Gave him a piccolo.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Plays it well.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.735 align:middle line:90%
Oboe, bassoon, French horn.

00:05:23.735 --> 00:05:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>> All the same musical styles?

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, he would ask him, you
know, play some kind of tune

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:90%
that we could recognize.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:84%
He ran him through
the whole orchestra.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And he, the professor,
then tells his mother,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I need to call
somebody in New York.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
We need to send him
to some other school.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I mean, this
is absolutely phenomenal.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And then the boy just says,
I'm not going anywhere.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't even like playing.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:90%
And he just hates it.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And so he walks
out, and that's it.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:90%
So they go home with the boy.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.148 align:middle line:84%
And I knew the
family really well.

00:06:11.148 --> 00:06:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Were there any other
special things happening,

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
like did he speak
different languages?

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
But there was the other
shoe to drop, and it did.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.840 align:middle line:84%
He picked up a pen,
and he started drawing.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And the kid never, you know,
couldn't draw more than a, you

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:90%
know, a stick figure.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And he is, as fast as
the ink could flow,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
he can outrun the
viscosity of the ink.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:84%
You know how an artist draws,
they draw, and they look at it,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
think, draw some
more, and look at it.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:90%
No, man.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Not this kid.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:84%
He'd start and as fast and
furious, until he's completed.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:84%
In 20 minutes, he
would do a portrait

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.020 align:middle line:84%
which it would rival
Norman Rockwell in detail.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Just brilliant.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
And that was just an ink pen.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turned out his
mother got him more things.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So he tried chalk, and
oils, and paintings

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
in every kind of medium you
could think of in artistry.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:90%
He could do it all.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And like the music, he would,
as soon he's through drawing,

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
wads it up and throws
it in the trash can.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And he would-- with a hiss,
he would say, I hate drawing.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:90%
And I hate music.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So he just hates whatever
it is that he's gifted.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.480 align:middle line:90%
And he hated it.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:90%
And this started me thinking.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I started reflecting
back on him as a child,

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:84%
later grows up to be
an adult. And he's gay.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I think we give these alien
encounters way too much credit.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
omni-knowledged,

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:90%
they're all knowing.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:84%
They drive a really
cool vehicle.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.150 align:middle line:84%
They cross vast
distances to get here.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:90%
They must be so smart.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:90%
I think that's all bullshit.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Because they got the
same problems we got.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>> They have mistakes.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Things break down.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Murphy's Law up their yin yang.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.400 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of things.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Ship don't work.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:90%
You know, parts fail.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.120 align:middle line:84%
They got the same
problems we got.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they just don't
know what they're doing.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I think because the boy
was gay, whatever they did,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know
what a gay human was.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
went negative on him.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
He hated the talents
that he was given.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And it changed him
and his personality.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:84%
He was the easiest
going kid you ever met--

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
funny, easy to get
along with, cooperative.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, he was mean,
just mean-spirited.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.760 align:middle line:90%
So was that a good encounter?

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And it started right
then and there.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't end there.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:84%
He would disappear for years,
wouldn't hear from him.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.540 align:middle line:90%
That was odd.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Didn't know if he
was alive or dead.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:84%
One time period, he
disappeared for eight years.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.305 align:middle line:84%
Come to find out he was
living with Betty Hill,

00:09:27.305 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:90%
with Barney and Betty Hill.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Lived with Betty.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:84%
But I got him to talk
to me from time to time.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.560 align:middle line:10%
And I asked, what in
God's name are you

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:10%
doing up there with Betty Hill?

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the same
aliens that he encountered,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.400 align:middle line:90%
she encountered.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And both of them,
her and him, they

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
were like a catch
and release program,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:84%
like you tagged a couple
fish and let them loose.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, at this particular
point, the salmons

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:90%
are swimming together.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And then he invited his mother--

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, goodness.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> --to come up and visit
Betty Hill and stay with them.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.515 align:middle line:84%
And then his mother
told me, Lord God, I

00:10:06.515 --> 00:10:08.080 align:middle line:90%
went up there to visit him.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:84%
They took me out to a place
called the Indian Head up

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:90%
in New Hampshire.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's so isolated
there, they got signs

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:84%
on the sign of the road
that says "Beware of Moose."

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, there's not
too many people up there.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And they went out to
these railroad tracks.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:90%
And I went, why railroad tracks?

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:90%
She said, Lord, have mercy.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
I was standing there
and asking, you know,

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.180 align:middle line:84%
her son, you know, what's
the railroad track?

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.250 align:middle line:90%
He said, turn around and look.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And she, the
mother, said, I did.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, Lord have mercy.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge spacecraft
or something

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that looks like a spacecraft
she'd seen in movies.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not a disk.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a--

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:middle line:84%
she said it looked more
like a "Star Wars" craft.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was totally silent.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was about
10 feet above them.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And it just drifted
right over them.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And when it got past
them, it stopped.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And she said these big legs
came out and clamped on

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:90%
to the railroad rails.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said you could hear
the railroad rails, you know,

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:84%
squeaking and hopping
under the load.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And the boy said,
there's a reason for that.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
When these spacecrafts
come in, when

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
they shut their
engines completely off,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:84%
they are frigging
unbelievably heavy.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.820 align:middle line:90%
And I started thinking, wow.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Railroad tracks.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Railroad locomotive
weighs about 450 tons.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's really logical.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:90%
So now he's got my attention.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what else?

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's another set of
arms that came down and clamped

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:90%
on the rails.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:90%
I said, what is that?

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, you ever thought
about railroad rails?

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's two of them,
and they go in a track.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, but they're
continuously connected.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, they
would be, or the train

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:90%
would run off the rail.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
He said, from Canada,
to North America,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.220 align:middle line:84%
to Mexico, to South
America, the railroad rails

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.660 align:middle line:90%
are all connected together.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't know any difference
in boundaries and borders.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.590 align:middle line:90%
The rails are continuous.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, so when
they clamp down on the rails,

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:34.333 align:middle line:84%
they're clamping on millions
of miles of railroad.

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It's its own
grid, the railway.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an antenna.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>> They clamp onto it and
use the entire hemisphere

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:84%
as an antenna to send
messages back and forth.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said and thought
about that, I know this boy.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:84%
He can't even
change oil on a car.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And this stuff he's
saying is so technically

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:84%
accurate, making
logic and sense.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, man, what
is up with this dude?

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:90%
So I'm taking all this in.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And I know the story of
Betty and Barney Hill.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:90%
And I got to talk to Betty.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And she was enjoying the company
of the boy and his mother.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her, I said, well,
y'all seem to get along really

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well, there's
a good reason for that.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:84%
When they come to
collect her data--

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle line:90%
oh, yeah.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a minute.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:90%
How do they do that?

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, they stick a probe
in the back of our necks.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And they said it's a
deep hole at first.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, the
boy is a type 2 diabetic.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to
heal up from that.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, oh, yeah, he does.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:10%
In about 24 hours,
that big hole is gone,

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:10%
and it's just a white,
flaky patch on it.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And then another 24 hours of
the white patch flakes off,

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.867 align:middle line:84%
and there's not
even a scar left.

00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And I go, do they do the
same thing to you, Betty?

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, yeah.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.795 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, why
are you doing that?

00:14:00.795 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, we're both
tagged by the same people.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, holy smokes.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So what do you make
of all this stuff?

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing there going,
I haven't got a clue.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to process
this all and take it in.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:84%
But I've been around people
that talk about UFOs and stuff.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And man, you all are coming out
with stuff I ain't never heard.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And yet it makes total sense.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Did he ever tell you anything
about Betty on the side that

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:84%
she said that she
never came public with?

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Other than-- do you remember
she wanted to take a book from

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:90%
the spacecraft.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And the others said you can't
take anything, hard evidence.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:90%
That always bugged her.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:10%
And she also had the star
map that we know about,

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:10%
all the different
planets and positions.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:10%
Well, it turns out I
was doing a project

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:10%
over at Ohio State University.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And they had Betty's
star map in there.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:middle line:90%
And it was a wooden frame cage.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.530 align:middle line:90%
And there was an accident.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:15.006 align:middle line:84%
Somebody-- I forgot-- they
dropped something on it

00:15:15.006 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and just smashed that
thing to oblivion.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.860 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't know what to do.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:90%
And they were all distraught.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm a modeler.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:10%
I said, dude, I can
build this again for you.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So I get out the wood
and get all the string,

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.930 align:middle line:84%
get all the little balls out
with the planets, you know,

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.263 align:middle line:84%
move them up and down the
strings, look at the star map,

00:15:34.263 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:90%
line them up.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not rocket science.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.670 align:middle line:10%
It's more like putting a
square peg in a round hole.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.230 align:middle line:90%
So I get it all done.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And while I was doing it,
something struck me about that.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:10%
So I called an old friend
who I really sorely miss,

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:10%
a guy named Carl Sagan.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.175 align:middle line:10%
And I asked him
about the star map.

00:15:55.175 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:10%
And he said, yeah, I'm
familiar with that.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:10%
And I said, are you
familiar with they

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.780 align:middle line:10%
can't find that constellation?

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.080 align:middle line:84%
He goes, you know, he said, send
me a scanning of that thing.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.610 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have
scanners back then,

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
so I just took a
Polaroid picture,

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:90%
put a black drop behind it.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Really got a good picture.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:84%
But I could map out
the stars really well.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's all Carl needed.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Just needed a two-dimensional
page with the stars

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.255 align:middle line:90%
in position.

00:16:22.255 --> 00:16:23.130 align:middle line:90%
And I sent it to him.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:84%
When he comes back,
he finds the star map.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Carl, what do you
mean, you found the star map?

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I just made it here
and sent it to you.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.490 align:middle line:84%
We do random shots all
the time, all year long.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how many years
has it been since that thing?

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.320 align:middle line:90%
And I said, good god.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.350 align:middle line:84%
20 some years at this time
since she first made that thing.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, look
at the thing I sent you.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And I took the two star maps
and held them up to the light.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:90%
And they aligned.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
It was like 300 different
planets, the moon,

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and they all aligned.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.105 align:middle line:90%
I said, how is that possible?

00:17:01.105 --> 00:17:02.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, you
know we're traveling

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:90%
100,000 miles an hour.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.030 align:middle line:84%
For every hour that passes
here, we have went 100,000 miles

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:90%
through space.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.240 align:middle line:10%
So after about 25 years of
traveling at that speed,

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.060 align:middle line:10%
we finally got into a position
where we saw the star field.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, Carl, that would
mean that 25 years ago,

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.569 align:middle line:84%
when she saw that
star map, it had

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:84%
to come from somebody that was
in that position over there,

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.430 align:middle line:84%
which we don't have that
kind of travel thing.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:90%
He goes, yeah.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:90%
Carl said, ain't that a hoot.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:90%
I said, how do you explain that?

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, I can't.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:90%
So there's another mystery.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But how did Betty Hill line
up all those star systems?

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.750 align:middle line:84%
The odds of that
happening is just--

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:47.230 align:middle line:84%
it's ridiculous to say, oh, it's
just by luck, or it was just,

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:90%
you know, happenstance.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:84%
No, there's a lot of
credibility thing going on

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:90%
with that Betty Hill case.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
Barney is not around.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
He died from-- that's
something I learned from Betty.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Barney couldn't accept
that happened to him.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.210 align:middle line:84%
He referred to himself as a
rabbit hiding in the bush.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And that constant
fear and dread--

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.940 align:middle line:84%
he had a cerebral
hemorrhage and died.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So that goes back to
my original opinion

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:84%
that not all encounters
are really good.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, it killed Barney,
messed up this boy forever.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I think we give them way
too much credit that they

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:84%
know everything, know
what they're doing.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.120 align:middle line:90%
No, they don't.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
They're down here
experimenting, for one reason.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Why do you experiment?
'Cause you don't know stuff.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.140 align:middle line:10%
And then there's Calvin Parker.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, tell me
the story on that.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, they're deep
south people, OK?

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.788 align:middle line:84%
And if you think I'm
deep south, man, you

00:18:51.788 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:84%
haven't seen deep
south till you meet

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.470 align:middle line:90%
somebody like Calvin Parker.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And Calvin is a really
wonderful person.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But you know, they're sitting
there going, golly, you know?

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.592 align:middle line:84%
And they went fishing
down at the river.

00:19:07.592 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And while they're fishing,
they hear a strange noise.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Here comes this
being, teleporting,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:90%
floating over to them.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a spacecraft sitting
behind them, saucer shape.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And they grabbed both of
them, and they take them in.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And Calvin has a downright pitch
fit battle, which, actually,

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:90%
that makes total sense.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:84%
You grab a boy from the
backwoods like that,

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to start
doing weird things to him,

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.680 align:middle line:84%
he's going to come
at you if he can.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.010 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And he actually got in
a fight with this alien,

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.190 align:middle line:90%
and blood got splashed on him.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:90%
He got rid of his shirt.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Boy, if he had kept it, we
would have had DNA trace.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:10%
But he had a wild event,
because like Travis Walton,

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.015 align:middle line:10%
they was shoving
stuff down his throat.

00:19:58.015 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:10%
And it's choking him.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:10%
So he's going to react.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just not with
the crowd going,

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:84%
oh, how wonderful
the Grays come here.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.778 align:middle line:84%
They're going to share,
and bond, and nurture.

00:20:10.778 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And I sure in the
hell am not going--

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>> You've seen so much negative.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not going to hold hands
and sing kumbaya by the camp

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.700 align:middle line:90%
fire with them things.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they monitored too
after this catch and release

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.830 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of their lives
or a certain amount of period?

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Apparently, Betty
Hill and this boy are.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Its lifetime.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we run
programs like that,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
we normally run it the entire
life span of the animal.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:90%
And then the data would collect.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But at least our people,
when they get data,

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:44.245 align:middle line:84%
they learn more about the
animal and work better with it.

00:20:44.245 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Whereas I don't think these
things are learning too good.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Does this include humans?

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't know.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, I would think so.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, I always thought, what
about the concept of pulling up

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.072 align:middle line:90%
to somebody and go, hi.

00:20:59.072 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Want to help me here and
work with some things?

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:90%
I need to answer some questions.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Could use a few tissue samples.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Won't hurt you.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Let's work together.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, ain't that a humane
or a more correct approach

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:84%
than just floating in the
room at night, zapping you,

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:84%
do god knows what to you, and
then, what, erase your memory,

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:90%
wipe your memory?

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible some of these
people that get abducted get

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.097 align:middle line:90%
upgrades to their bodies?

00:21:28.097 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, that's an
interesting thought.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:10%
Now see, if they did something
like that, then that's logical.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Our scientists do it
to animals that we do.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
As they learn more
from the animal,

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:90%
they upgrade to get more data.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:10%
But I'm assuming when you
say upgrade, what, give us

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:10%
more skills, stuff like that?

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in a positive
way, more upgrades.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's
probably possible.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.010 align:middle line:84%
It makes me think there's
more than one race doing this.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:10%
It could be 100 different
races coming here,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.280 align:middle line:10%
and they got all their
different agendas.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.410 align:middle line:10%
And some people, like Calvin
Parker, and Travis Walton,

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:14.300 align:middle line:10%
and them, they run into groups
that aren't that nice about it.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:84%
But there are others
I've listened to,

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and they've had nothing
but pleasant experiences.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:90%
So it could be--

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.720 align:middle line:84%
sounds like to me,
different groups.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:10%
Or if it is the
same species, it's

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:10%
different subgroups
inside that group.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that makes
a lot of sense.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.465 align:middle line:84%
Are those programs in any way
connected to Betty and Barney?

00:22:34.465 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:10%
>> As far as the catch
and release program?

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, because they're still--

00:22:38.758 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> They're still being visited?

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Last I heard, this has
been, oh, ongoing for, god,

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.180 align:middle line:90%
almost 40 years now.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.347 align:middle line:10%
That's a long time.

00:22:50.347 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:84%
But if they're going
to do a lifetime,

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.970 align:middle line:84%
they'll go on up to 60,
70 years, till they die.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And whatever data they're
extruding from that, you know,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
only they know what they're
going to do with it.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible when Travis
got too close to the craft

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and was rendered unconscious, it
was because of electromagnetic

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.410 align:middle line:90%
energy?

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Who knows?

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.490 align:middle line:90%
It could have been.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they take
him to save him,

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.540 align:middle line:84%
or did they take him
to experiment on him?

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.120 align:middle line:90%


00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>> If you listen to the
whole event with him,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of like
a one-way street.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.550 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't getting a lot
of answers on anything.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.538 align:middle line:84%
He was just having a lot
of stuff done to him.

00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard through the grapevine
that he was upset about that

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:84%
movie that they made about
him because it was not that

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:40.580 align:middle line:90%
vicious, he said.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now, see, that
actually would make sense to me.

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.150 align:middle line:90%
And it just muddies the waters.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:10%
Man, this is the
most muddy water

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.425 align:middle line:10%
I've ever encountered
in my life.

00:23:50.425 --> 00:23:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It's such a
delicate subject too,

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:84%
because there are those
abductees and people from these

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.680 align:middle line:84%
programs of catch and release
that have many different views

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:90%
on it as well.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's many different, I
think, ways to look at this.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And there is a smoke
screen, 100% either way,

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:90%
however you're thinking.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.153 align:middle line:84%
Because I know from being in
the projects as well as you

00:24:13.153 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:84%
do that they can replicate
anything, even me right here,

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:84%
just using photons and
three-dimensional imagery,

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and cast a shadow, and be
a little palpable, because

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
of the arrangement of
the atomic structure.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So I can't even justify that
I'm really talking to you right

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:29.270 align:middle line:90%
now, David.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that make
you feel comfortable?

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.237 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is
what makes you go--

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:84%
this is what people like
us understand out there.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what is
real, and what is not?

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And how can I answer
something even scientifically

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:90%
when I can also debunk myself?

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's just it.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:50.720 align:middle line:10%
And God knows, I got more skills
than somebody should have.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm capable of dealing
with a lot of stuff.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I've got an intellect that
serves me pretty well.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:10%
The average person
out there that

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.780 align:middle line:10%
has no experience with all this
stuff and they encounter it,

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:10%
God knows what
that does to them.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.417 align:middle line:84%
And then they run
off and leave them.

00:25:07.417 --> 00:25:09.750 align:middle line:84%
The poor things are sitting
there, did this even happen?

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Am I going crazy?

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And plus, we're so creative
with our minds and the way

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:84%
we've been programmed with
Hollywood and the media that we

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:84%
would think, even if
one were to touch us,

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:90%
how dare you even touch me?

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And here, you're not
allowed to touch anyone.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.020 align:middle line:10%
>> There's agendas running left
and right from all different

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.230 align:middle line:10%
directions, from
different groups.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Of course, all of you know
Carl Sagan built Voyager.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.115 align:middle line:10%
And he alone is responsible
for the creation

00:25:40.115 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:10%
of the whole project.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And it got done, which
was a miracle in itself.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how he
ever pulled it off.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But we put these
platters out there

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that you can lift a
stylus and put it on.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:10%
And it's a record
that plays back.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:10%
And you should hear the
stuff on this record.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.465 align:middle line:10%
But these things have went--

00:25:59.465 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:10%
there's four of them.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.118 align:middle line:10%
There's two Voyagers.

00:26:02.118 --> 00:26:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> These are not your
normal vinyl records.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we should tell them that
this is the hardest substance

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:07.795 align:middle line:90%
on the planet that we have.

00:26:07.795 --> 00:26:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I helped coat the
records with a substance called

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:90%
beryllium.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.350 align:middle line:90%
And it will keep.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:10%
Out in space, it works really
well as a preservative.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So four and a half
billion years later,

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:24.330 align:middle line:84%
if an alien race
encounters Voyager,

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:84%
it'll be able to
lift up the stylus,

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:84%
put it on, and listen to
what the record has to say.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>> It comes with
its own jukebox.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It really does.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But this is where
the argument started.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Carl also put the
pulsar next to us

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:42.300 align:middle line:84%
that's spread throughout
the entire galaxy, not just

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.010 align:middle line:90%
the solar system.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.710 align:middle line:10%
Then he puts a map
of the solar system,

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:10%
third planet from the sun,
and with an arrow pointing

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.992 align:middle line:10%
to the spacecraft.

00:26:51.992 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:10%
And then there's a
picture of a naked man

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:10%
and woman he had drawn.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So they're the ones
who built the craft.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And now-- and on
that record, there's

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:84%
every known language on the
planet that's saying hello.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So now they've got languages
of all our planets.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.860 align:middle line:90%
And I went, God almighty, Carl.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Think about this for a minute.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:84%
You didn't send one, you sent
four notes in the bottles

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.120 align:middle line:84%
out in a different
direction of the compass.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>> We're over here.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Come get us.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Here I am.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Here's the map.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Here's home.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.743 align:middle line:90%
This is what we look like.

00:27:23.743 --> 00:27:24.870 align:middle line:90%
We have pictures of us.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And we've got this
recording of our music,

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:90%
our culture, our languages.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you are an invading
army, what a treasure trove

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:84%
of information you've just been
given to infiltrate and get us.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And boy, Carl and
I, we go at it.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:90%
God almighty.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.650 align:middle line:84%
More than once, I got
a book thrown at me.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And he gave you
that tie, didn't he?

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.220 align:middle line:90%
Carl, yeah, got me this.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a beautiful tie.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.580 align:middle line:84%
If you guys can see
this, it's the moon.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.880 align:middle line:90%
And notice the craters are red.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I've noticed that.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> That Carl said, this
tie is especially for you.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Why is that, Carl?

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.240 align:middle line:90%
The craters are red.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's that mean?

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Like you, you've always got
this volcano going on in you.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.050 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, thanks, Carl.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.390 align:middle line:84%
But he asked, well,
when would we be ready?

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I said, how about when we've
got a planetary defense

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.856 align:middle line:84%
system, where we got
anti-matter weapons, where you

00:28:17.856 --> 00:28:19.490 align:middle line:90%
can blow an entire fleet away?

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Something to protect ourselves.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Not that we're going to
use an offensive weapon.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.800 align:middle line:90%
They come in to visit, fine.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But don't mess with us, 'cause
we can do something about it.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Did he ever have any
experiences, Carl Sagan,

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that you're aware of,
that he shared with you?

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>> None that I'm aware of.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:38.100 align:middle line:10%
Boy, he sure wanted to.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:84%
If anybody should have
represented us as an ambassador

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.430 align:middle line:84%
to an alien race, it should
have been Carl Sagan.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:48.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Boy had an ego.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:84%
But he really had a good
personality and intellect

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:90%
to match it.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of boys, whatever
happened to that boy?

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> He's disappeared.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.933 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen or heard from
him or anything about him.

00:29:04.933 --> 00:29:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The family
doesn't know either?

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> For 10 years, he's gone.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.240 align:middle line:10%
I would like to think they
came and got him, and took him,

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:10%
and maybe correct some of
the problems they caused.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:22.490 align:middle line:10%
They owe him a new life,
is what they owe him.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:90%
But he's disappeared.
