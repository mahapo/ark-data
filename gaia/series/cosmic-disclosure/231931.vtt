prior to this, any experiences.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I thought anybody who talked
about the subject was loony.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But then when I started
having these experiences

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:90%
and now it's like--

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.145 align:middle line:84%
feels like it's my calling and
my mission to get this out.

Mike, welcome back to the show.

>> HERRERA: Thanks
for having me back on.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Of course.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So you've had experiences
with skywatcher and psionics,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:84%
but before you were ever
associated with them,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.062 align:middle line:84%
did you have your own personal
experiences with contact?

00:01:24.062 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes, I did.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first time I've
ever really talked about it

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:90%
publicly.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And the reason being is because
what I've blown the whistle on

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:84%
was already way over
people's heads as it is.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.720 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard for them
to grasp the understanding

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:90%
that things like that do happen.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And thankful, but also
a little concerning

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:84%
is that I'm not
the only one that's

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:84%
had that issue happened in 2009
with similar type of operations

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:90%
that people have came across.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Wait, so did you have
contact experiences before 2009?

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Or that sparked you to
be more interested in it,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and that led to your own
personal kind of exploration

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.390 align:middle line:90%
into it?

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: That sparked it,
because that day confirmed two

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.192 align:middle line:84%
things, and I've said this
publicly but I'm going

00:02:04.192 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:90%
to continue saying it.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:84%
That day confirmed
two things for me.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.190 align:middle line:10%
One, that we now know
for a fact that humans do

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.438 align:middle line:10%
possess this technology.

00:02:12.438 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:10%
I know that personally as well.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:10%
And I think other
people are understanding

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:10%
that that's a reality.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:10%
Two, is that we obviously got
that technology from something

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:10%
else besides ourselves.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:10%
And we have a lot of brilliant
people in the scientific world,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:10%
especially in the programs
that can have some very out

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:10%
of the box thinking that
they can keep it quiet.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:10%
But we obviously had a jump in
that technology from something.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:10%
Either crash
retrievals or instances

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:10%
where we talk about
Roswell, which was

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.870 align:middle line:10%
theorized that night vision,
Kevlar, and fiber optics

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.732 align:middle line:10%
came from that crash that was
pretty much put into the public.

00:02:47.732 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So I know we're about
to jump into this incredible

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.960 align:middle line:84%
event at Joshua Tree
National Park in California.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But before we get to that,
how did this start for you?

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Like, how did you get into
trying to make contact?

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, I stumbled
onto it accidentally.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I was at a very low
point in my life.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:90%
I had lost everything.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.130 align:middle line:90%
I lost my job.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I lost a relationship.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And I started
getting into the gym

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
because even when I
was in the military,

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I was getting-- wanting
to get into bodybuilding.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is, I was
doing good in the gym,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
but how do I work on
myself internally?

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.608 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that was always suggested

00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:19.390 align:middle line:84%
was meditation, trying to
get your mind at peace.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:90%
I started doing that.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I would go over to
Red Rocks, near Red Rocks.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like more Mount
Falcon park area that

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:90%
is very adjacent to Red Rocks.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So I would start
meditating over there.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And there was a parking
lot that nobody knew about,

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.462 align:middle line:84%
and I used to drive up there
probably about 10:00 or 11

00:03:35.462 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:90%
o'clock at night.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And I would start just
sitting there relaxing.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.022 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to get away
from everything and everybody

00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and just be isolated, but
be in a sense of nature

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:90%
and just outdoors.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:90%
And I started meditating.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And I started getting
these weird feelings

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:90%
because nobody was around.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:90%
So I then would get out of--

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I literally opened my
eyes and look around,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and I would see some things
that would be in the sky.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what they were.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So you weren't
trying to reach out,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:90%
you were just meditating.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I was
just meditating.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: But then I started--
because what I was really was

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:84%
trying to search was
like, is there anything,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
like looking for an answer
from something, like God,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
for example, like
give me an answer.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
Instead it wasn't God that I
was unknowingly reaching out to.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I didn't
even know what I was doing.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.718 align:middle line:84%
And I started seeing
these orange orbs appear

00:04:26.718 --> 00:04:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that were off in the sky
and off in the distance.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.218 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you'd
see things that

00:04:30.218 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
would appear very
high up that were just

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.160 align:middle line:90%
zigzagging across the sky.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.215 align:middle line:84%
But they're moving so fast and
they were changing directions.

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, that's
not a satellite,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
change directions

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.340 align:middle line:90%
off the fly like that.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And two, there's no
aircraft that I'm

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
aware of that can fly as
high as what they were at.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
But I could see them
moving up there.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the second
time I did this,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I started having these
connections happen.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Like something felt like
it was right next to me.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's the only way I can
really describe it at the time.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking around,
I was like, well, there's

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:90%
nobody up here.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Like what-- why is there a
sense that somebody is nearby?

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, I would
see these orbs appear again.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And they would move from one
point, they would disappear,

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:84%
they'd move over here,
they would have some ones

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.420 align:middle line:90%
that were very high up.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
The third time that I really
started catching onto it.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So when I would see
these orbs appear,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:84%
these anomaly appear, I would
ask it to move over here

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:90%
and that's what it would do.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, really?

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yep.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: That's when I kind
of freaked out because I was

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:84%
like, there's nothing that can
really disappear and then move

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
over here with an
instant type of thought.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Was it awe or was it
fear when that first happened?

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: A
little bit of both,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
know what it was.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had speculation,
was this ET?

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is this real?

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Which I already knew
it was real based off

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:84%
of my experience in 2009,
but I didn't have any contact

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:90%
with non-humans at that point.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
This was a rogue group of
former tier 1 operators that

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
are operating with a
clandestine organization that

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.075 align:middle line:84%
has access to this technology
that's been reverse-engineered.

00:06:04.075 --> 00:06:06.450 align:middle line:84%
There was no indication that
there was non-humans present

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:90%
during that event.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:90%
I never saw any.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the mindset
at the time was,

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:18.090 align:middle line:84%
I was open to the idea of maybe
yes, extraterrestrials do exist,

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.010 align:middle line:84%
but I had no idea that you
could ever contact them.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Right.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: One of the things
that really kind of made me

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:90%
start tapping into this--

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and this is how I got
involved with Dr. Greer.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:84%
One, I was, at the
time, I was working

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.422 align:middle line:84%
a job where I was delivering
tires across the state.

00:06:35.422 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So I had these routes that
would take me eight hours.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.297 align:middle line:84%
And I loved it because all I had
was window time the whole time.

00:06:40.297 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:90%
I was by myself.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Just the open road.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
I can go on adventures, I
can just think about things.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I had my
phone at the time.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
I would have YouTube
videos that I would play,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:90%
but I would listen to things.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, a video
of Dr. Greer talking about this

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:90%
happened to play.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So he started
talking about this--

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:84%
the protocols,
talking about CE5,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:84%
talking about making contact,
how they would appear,

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.963 align:middle line:84%
what type of people who are
using meditation to do this.

00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I literally veered off the road,
parked on the side of the road,

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting there just
watching this, blown away

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
at the fact that somebody
else was talking about this.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.090 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea who Dr.
Greer was at the time.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So the more that I started
watching the stuff with Dr.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Greer, he started
talking about things

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:84%
that I happen to
experience, talking

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:84%
about classified
programs, talking

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:84%
about reverse-engineered
tech, talking

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:90%
about rogue organizations.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.150 align:middle line:84%
That is what basically got me
in tune with following him.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And then when he was
here in Boulder in 2018,

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:90%
he had an event here.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
I approached him.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And I bought a book
because he was doing--

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
at that time he
was signing books.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK, well,
how do I get up to him

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and tell him that I had an
experience with everybody now,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:84%
knowing that I've been public
about for the last couple years?

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:90%
So I had mentioned that to him.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:84%
I got him to sign the
book and I told him,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:84%
I saw something when I
was deployed as a Marine,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.900 align:middle line:90%
and I kind of explained it.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And at first when I said that
I had experienced something,

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.100 align:middle line:84%
he kind of like shrugged it off
because everybody says that.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And I get why, because
you get people that think

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:84%
they see things or they do,
but it's something like when

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to like--

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Yeah, like he gets
that all day, probably.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.233 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Exactly.

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But when I had said something
along the lines of what

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I had hypothesized
to be drug-smuggling,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.773 align:middle line:90%
that is when he stood up.

00:08:32.773 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:90%
He told everybody, be quiet.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:90%
He handed me his card.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:84%
He told me not to get
rid of the information.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.039 align:middle line:84%
And then when Sean Ryan, when
he did his first appearance

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:84%
on Sean Ryan talking about
these protections in place,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I had decided I wanted to
reach out to him at that point

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and talk about this.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.755 align:middle line:84%
Because apparently in my view at
that time, he was the only one.

00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I felt like
he was the only one that

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:84%
could really get
the message out,

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.240 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't wanting
to be public at that time.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:84%
So I had a phone
call with him that

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:90%
lasted probably several hours.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about
what I now have

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.040 align:middle line:84%
been public about, such as this
operation I encountered in 2009.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Then fast-forward
to June of a couple

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:84%
years ago, the
National Press Club, I

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:90%
made my appearance at in 2023.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.520 align:middle line:10%
He also had a two-day
event prior to that.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:84%
That was segueing
into that event

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
where a bunch of
other whistleblowers

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.480 align:middle line:90%
were coming forward.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So fast-forward to
today, ever since I've

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:84%
been able to come forward,
and at that point,

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.060 align:middle line:84%
even before then of having
my experiences with contact,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:90%
it kind of intersected.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:10%
When I was talking to Jake,
at first, when I was basically

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.600 align:middle line:10%
in communication with him, one
of the things, because he was,

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:10%
one, he explained what I saw.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.300 align:middle line:90%
He knew exactly what it was.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:84%
He knew what his
descriptions were

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:84%
because it was exactly what
they were dealing with.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So except he was an
operator at that level,

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and I was somebody who was
just an incidental witness,

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that this
was even something remotely

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:84%
into psionics or transportation
of psionic assets that

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:90%
are recruited.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea until
he brought that up,

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.923 align:middle line:84%
and he was able to prove to me
that that was really the case.

00:10:07.923 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Now, this
is fascinating.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I thought you got into
this once you met Jacob

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:90%
after your experience in 2009.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize that you
were an actual experiencer who

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:84%
went through all that,
that led up to this moment.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.992 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, the reason--
everybody can dread being

00:10:22.992 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:84%
at a low point in your life,
being depressed, being--

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:84%
I was at a point
where I committed--

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:90%
almost committed suicide.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Oh, I'm
sorry to hear that.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.765 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And it took-- this
is where I talk about the stress

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:36.160 align:middle line:84%
inoculation before, of having
the stressors applied to get you

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:90%
to respond in certain ways.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: This is
what segued into that.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And fortunately, the
method I tried to use did not

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.870 align:middle line:84%
work because it malfunctioned,
but I'm thankful of that

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
because I would have missed
out on so much in this life.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And me now, where
I'm at, where I'm

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:84%
able to contribute to mankind,
try to contribute to people,

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and try to get
this issue solved.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Because I've had
experiences both

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.030 align:middle line:84%
with the clandestine
operations, but also

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.177 align:middle line:90%
with making contact now.

00:11:02.177 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So I don't
want to brush over that.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:84%
So you, at one point,
actually were so low

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.557 align:middle line:84%
that you thought about or
attempted to take your own life.

00:11:09.557 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And then through
contact experiences

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.992 align:middle line:84%
and meditation, you
rebuilt up who you were.

00:11:15.992 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Absolutely.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.355 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Because here's the
thing, it's like not everybody--

00:11:20.355 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
like, I just
stumbled on to that.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that this
sort of thing could be done.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.273 align:middle line:84%
So when I hear people talking
about it's impossible,

00:11:28.273 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm not the
smartest person.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the brightest,
I'm not the strongest.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm a regular guy.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I try
to be all the time

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and just try to be
level with everything.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling people
that, yes, you can do this.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.277 align:middle line:84%
If you really put
your mind to it,

00:11:42.277 --> 00:11:44.110 align:middle line:84%
just like with anything
that you have to do,

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:90%
you can achieve those results.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.453 align:middle line:90%
You can do this yourself.

00:11:47.453 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Let's move on to this
incredible encounter I want

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:90%
to cover with you.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:55.550 align:middle line:84%
You said you had this event,
contact event, pre-Skywatcher,

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:84%
at Joshua Tree
National Park, where--

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.630 align:middle line:84%
tell me if the number
is wrong, but you're

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.150 align:middle line:84%
reporting that up to
93 different anomalies

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.152 align:middle line:84%
you saw in just one
hour during this event?

00:12:05.152 --> 00:12:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Absolutely.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: All right.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:84%
You got to walk me
through all that, please.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.047 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yeah, so at
the Joshua Tree event,

00:12:10.047 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Jake was present there.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it was a
2024 July time frame.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
This is when we were kind of
doing things with Dr. Greer

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:90%
to show him some things.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But then also he was wanting to
learn how this also works, too.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So Greer was also a sounding
board for him as well.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So they're kind of mixing ideas
and trying to figure it out.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to
go to Joshua Tree

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and do different methods of
contact that we could record.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And we have, one, we
have Flightradar24.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.080 align:middle line:84%
That way we can see oncoming
aircraft, helicopters,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Very
familiar with that.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: They have an app
that tracks satellites such

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:90%
as Starlink.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.598 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
a lot of Starlink

00:12:47.598 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:90%
we were picking up, too.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
Starlink is very linear

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and just like
regular satellites,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:90%
they just orbit a certain path.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.418 align:middle line:84%
The anomaly that
we're having were

00:12:56.418 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:84%
like white orbs that were
dancing with each other

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.680 align:middle line:90%
off in the distance.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Like erratically
moving around?

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's very UFO-y.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just like
it was just like there

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and just like a bright
light, was just stationary.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.560 align:middle line:90%
This was actually moving.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.602 align:middle line:84%
They would disappear, they
would come into frame,

00:13:10.602 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and then would-- because we
were getting video of this, too.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.180 align:middle line:84%
There were several
anomaly like orbs

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:84%
that were on the ground
that would flash in and out.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.640 align:middle line:84%
There was blue-colored,
there was white colored.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:84%
We had instances like the
gold disk I've talked about

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
before that I've seen
many times appeared there,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and it just appears
for a second,

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.677 align:middle line:84%
and then it just
disappears, moves over here.

00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
We've had ones that
look like shooting

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:84%
stars that would come like this,
and then it would just bank off.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Shooting stars don't do that.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But these were coming
in, look like one,

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:84%
but then it would just
change course and fly up.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:90%
So we saw that quite a bit.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So Joshua Tree has a very
positive energy to it.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:84%
There's rumor that
there's something

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.980 align:middle line:84%
underneath the
desert that's maybe

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional or something
that attracts these.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: I've heard that, yeah.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: That's what we were
basically trying to tap in.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So when
you say 93, though,

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
every time an orb appeared,
there was a check.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Someone was keeping
track of it all?

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: We were counting.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So every time
the disk appeared,

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:84%
every time an orb appeared--
they were on the ground, too?

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yep.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Like how close to you?

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.422 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Several feet.

00:14:05.422 --> 00:14:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: It's feet?

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: You think
those might have been--

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
we think those may
have been entities.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:90%
We don't think they were craft.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Did it feel different
when they were that close?

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.665 align:middle line:90%
Very, very energetic.

00:14:14.665 --> 00:14:17.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I mean
energetic, I mean like power--

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:90%
like near a power line.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're in the
middle of the desert.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing out there
power lines wise, right?

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And so to have that
feeling like you're standing

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:84%
next to something that's making
your hair kind of stand up

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:84%
or feel, that's what
we were feeling.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Was there any
communication at all or any

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:29.860 align:middle line:90%
like--

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.045 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Warm feelings
is all we were feeling,

00:14:32.045 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing like-- it
was a message was transmitted

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:90%
to your--

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: No downloads
or anything?

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: No,
nothing like that.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Wow--

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It was
like, hey, we're here.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:90%
You're here.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Like we're-- let's experience
this together is what that was

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: The ones that
were close to you,

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:90%
what color were those?

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Those were white
or blue orbs I kept seeing.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:90%
They would just flash.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: White and blue.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Some of them
would appear behind me.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So prior to Joshua Tree, we
also did an event in Sedona.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.823 align:middle line:10%
This was with Demi Lovato.

00:14:53.823 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:10%
We were out in Sedona
doing some contact

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.272 align:middle line:10%
because she's a very big
into this kind of stuff.

00:14:58.272 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:10%
So it was good to
see her reactions

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:10%
and good to see
them practice this.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was instances
where these orbs

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:90%
would appear behind me, too.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:84%
In one instance, it
was strange because I

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:15.072 align:middle line:84%
was sitting in a circle which
we had these chairs that we

00:15:15.072 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:84%
were sitting in
there very relaxing

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.010 align:middle line:90%
and everybody's in a circle.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Greer's across from me.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Demi's friend is over here.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Demi and her now
husband are over there.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:90%
And Paula Harris was there, too.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember, there's
some people on Greer's team

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:90%
were there.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.502 align:middle line:90%
There were two or three people.

00:15:33.502 --> 00:15:36.690 align:middle line:84%
We had did a meditation
cycle or basically getting

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:84%
into the state, and they
said that they saw something

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.818 align:middle line:84%
behind me, like appear
and then disappeared.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And usually the ones
that are closer to you

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:84%
are more the entity-based,
they're not like craft,

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:48.890 align:middle line:90%
because those are too big.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Sure.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Even though
they can be right over you,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:84%
you could be in one for all, you
know that's landed on the ground

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:90%
and you can feel it.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.350 align:middle line:90%
It's very odd.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.788 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:15:56.788 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And of course, they
kind shift in and out of this

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:90%
reality or this dimension.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.967 align:middle line:84%
So they're kind
of partially here.

00:16:01.967 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:84%
You could feel them,
but you can't see them.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, we had night
vision with us too.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So we can see some
things happen that you

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:90%
can't see with your naked eye.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
One instance that
was very odd to me

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.158 align:middle line:84%
was I got slapped on
the side by something.

00:16:16.158 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Like on your shoulder?

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: On the left side.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It slapped
like it made that sound.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Did it feel like a
bro slap or was it like a--

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It was--
it was pretty firm.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:90%
It was like--

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: It's like,
"hey, I'm here."

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah, pretty much.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.538 align:middle line:90%
And there was nothing around.

00:16:28.538 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like an
animal had hit me

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:84%
because nobody saw
anything flying away

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.970 align:middle line:84%
or nothing like that
or nothing hit--

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:90%
nothing hit the ground.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.045 align:middle line:90%
So it was very odd.

00:16:37.045 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Did it
feel threatening,

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
or was it more just
like, "hey, I'm here"?

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It was just
like, "hey, we're here.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:90%
What's up?"

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.005 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: That's incredible.

00:16:43.005 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: So it was odd.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK,
if that was something

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:84%
that was touching me to get
my attention, who was it?

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.723 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Like, come on.

00:16:51.723 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Like, let's have a conversation.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Because if you touch me,
let's shake hands, let's meet.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course, never
saw anything like that.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Never felt anything
like that either.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:90%
As far as--

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.987 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Who did you
speculate that was?

00:17:03.987 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Was there any talk about what
race that was or nothing?

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Nothing.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And nothing happened after
that once you got touched?

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Just visuals.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Just stuff like that.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.387 align:middle line:84%
Just orbs, just lights in
the sky, things like that.

00:17:15.387 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was crazy because we were
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.773 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: We were
off of any major paths,

00:17:21.773 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and we were pretty isolated.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.849 align:middle line:84%
And this was like 2
o'clock in the morning.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, there's
these groups that

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
try to go out that try to
disrupt what you're doing,

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.400 align:middle line:84%
regardless if it's skywatch or
regardless if it's even you,

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:84%
for example, you may
see some helicopters

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:84%
try to intercept
what you're doing

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.120 align:middle line:90%
and this happens all the time.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
We had some people
that for some reason

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:84%
were in an ATV that were driving
by, and they had a truck too.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were driving
off and you can

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:90%
hear some radio communication.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.320 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like a
radio like somebody

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.920 align:middle line:90%
listening to a radio station.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:84%
You could actually hear
people communicating.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:90%
So they drive right past us.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:90%
They're going slow.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're
trying to intimidate us,

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.625 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't working.

00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was only when we started
getting results happening

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.368 align:middle line:84%
from making contact and
stuff started to appear

00:18:07.368 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:90%
is when we got their attention.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:90%
We don't know who they were.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Oh, they
watching from a distance.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Absolutely.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: The other instance
in Joshua Tree is we had,

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
the same night, which no
aircraft were supposed to fly

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:84%
low into a National Park,
especially military.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.280 align:middle line:90%
They're not allowed to do that.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
We had a black
helicopter that literally

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.320 align:middle line:90%
had its lights turned off.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.780 align:middle line:84%
That was-- and we
could hear this.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
Jake was there with us

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and he's like, oh, we're
ready if anything happens,

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.805 align:middle line:84%
which they bring, they
bring their toys, of course,

00:18:32.805 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:84%
because we got to
be safe and we got

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
to be protected because
we know that there's

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:84%
people out there that don't
like why we're doing this.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
this to be known.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But I think everybody
should do this

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:84%
because the more people
start doing this--

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:90%
they can't control everybody.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yes.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.453 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: The only people--
the only people that can control

00:18:49.453 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:84%
this from not happening
is the doubts and the lack

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.630 align:middle line:90%
of self-belief in this.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:90%
It's really what stops people.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Belief is
super important.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.008 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Absolutely.

00:18:57.008 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:84%
If you believe it,
you will see it.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.270 align:middle line:90%
You need to change your mindset.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:84%
I visualize us achieving
the goal of disclosure

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.850 align:middle line:90%
and changing the world.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: First of all, you're
talking about the power

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.532 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And disclosure
is not going to just lead

00:19:09.532 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle line:84%
to the realization of
other intelligences.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.570 align:middle line:84%
It's also going to potentially
evolve our own consciousness.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Absolutely.

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a big key of it.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's my personal belief,
because if we evolve consciously

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.470 align:middle line:84%
together, one, we get to be
better people because we're also

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.190 align:middle line:84%
having the same kind of
breakthroughs personally, right?

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't really
think people who are

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:84%
going to be highly conscious
that are going to be bad.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:84%
There are some of
those people that can,

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:84%
but when you achieve that
type of consciousness,

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.070 align:middle line:84%
you also learn that
you're not really

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.950 align:middle line:84%
going to be confrontational
or you're going to really

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:84%
be adversarial
towards everybody else

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
because you understand
it's a waste of time.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:90%
There's no point to it.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:51.790 align:middle line:84%
We're all the same
type of people

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:84%
trying to get the same response,
trying to get the same answers.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.422 align:middle line:84%
We all want-- we all want
to know where we came from.

00:19:56.422 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:84%
We all want to know
if life is out there.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes it is.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.225 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you firsthand
with contracts.

00:20:01.225 --> 00:20:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you with everybody
else who came forward

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.170 align:middle line:84%
that is legitimate, who's
also said the same things.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.630 align:middle line:90%
So it is a very real thing.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: How have you
personally changed in relation

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.190 align:middle line:84%
to consciousness and how you
show up in the world pre these

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.125 align:middle line:90%
events and post?

00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, I think I was
a very closed-minded individual

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:90%
before that experience happened.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
oh, everybody's got

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:90%
ego and all this kind of stuff.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Ego doesn't get you
anywhere in this world.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.660 align:middle line:90%
It stunts your growth.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody
needs to understand,

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.618 align:middle line:84%
you got to put your ego
aside because, really, nobody

00:20:34.618 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:90%
knows anything.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.290 align:middle line:90%
It's the truth.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I
say this is because we

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:84%
don't know what happened
thousands of years

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.603 align:middle line:84%
ago, how the pyramids were
built. It's only speculation.

00:20:42.603 --> 00:20:43.430 align:middle line:90%
It's only theories.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:90%
We live in a world of theories.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world
where we experience

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:84%
what our body is
basically developed

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:84%
to encounter our
environment on Earth,

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
such as visual, smell,
touch, taste, feeling.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And the other sense that
people don't really tap into

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.750 align:middle line:90%
is consciousness, spiritual.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual means that you
have belief in something.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So you've become
more spiritual since these?

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Absolutely.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I will say that,
spiritually, yes,

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:84%
it's made me evolve into a
much higher consciousness

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:84%
type of person to
understand that, why are we

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.910 align:middle line:90%
fighting each other for this?

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.043 align:middle line:90%
It really derails the process.

00:21:22.043 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Your own personal life, too.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:28.087 align:middle line:84%
If you're very bitter
and very angry,

00:21:28.087 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
you need-- those people
need to change that.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:90%
There's no reason to be.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.253 align:middle line:84%
Life is too short to be
that, first and foremost.

00:21:33.253 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And two, it's going to
derail everything that you're

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.503 align:middle line:90%
trying to do for yourself.

00:21:36.503 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I would have been in
that type of situation.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I've been every kind
of thing that you

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:90%
could think of in that regard.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm trying to help
people change their lives.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.378 align:middle line:90%
I coach people on bodybuilding.

00:21:45.378 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I try to get people, even
business advice, things

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I try to get people
to be better.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why
I'm a Mason as well,

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.595 align:middle line:84%
is because that's our
notion to take good men

00:21:52.595 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:90%
and make them better.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:90%
That's how I found that.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I was a
Mason since I was 18.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So you can never be
satisfied with what

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
you're doing to the point
to where you stay stagnant.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.560 align:middle line:84%
You can be satisfied and embrace
what you've accomplished,

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:84%
but move on to the
next challenge.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.693 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: God, what you just
explained is one of the most

00:22:09.693 --> 00:22:12.643 align:middle line:84%
fascinating aspects of contact,
how it changes people forever.

00:22:12.643 --> 00:22:14.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
seeing a light in the sky,

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:84%
it's about what happens
to your life in the years

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.840 align:middle line:90%
after those events.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Absolutely.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Like you're not alone
in your whole experience.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.975 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And it actually
feels good to talk about this

00:22:22.975 --> 00:22:24.500 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
here publicly.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.628 align:middle line:84%
Because again, Jake and
a bunch of other people

00:22:27.628 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:84%
said, no, you need to
stay quiet about that

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:84%
until this starts to
become a regular thing.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.740 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Hence with Skywatcher,
hence with CE5.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced both
with each groups.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: I want to
back up a little bit.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I just want to know when you're
having these contact events,

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.340 align:middle line:90%
did you like--

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:84%
after your first couple moments
where you really had contact,

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.640 align:middle line:84%
did you look back and
think to yourself, wait,

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.245 align:middle line:84%
was I already being
contacted before I went out

00:22:50.245 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
in a meditative
state, were there

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.245 align:middle line:84%
are signs of something
happening almost

00:22:53.245 --> 00:22:57.080 align:middle line:84%
before that you didn't recognize
until after you had the moment?

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I've had those
thoughts because what I think

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:84%
the event in 2009 was
able to pull the veil off,

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:90%
if that makes any sense.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.442 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: But you're having
this event happen where you see

00:23:08.442 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:84%
something sitting there,
floating in a jungle that you

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.365 align:middle line:90%
would never see anywhere else.

00:23:12.365 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: That's wild.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It is
absolutely wild.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: But I guess what I'm
getting at is like in between

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:84%
contact events, are you
having communication in a way?

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Is there a knowing?

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else
between that you're

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.900 align:middle line:84%
like, OK, I feel
like something's

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:90%
trying to communicate with me?

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I don't
think specifically.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.235 align:middle line:84%
I just think they happened
to be at the right place

00:23:27.235 --> 00:23:29.810 align:middle line:84%
at the right time, and they're
just like, "hey, we're here.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:30.610 align:middle line:90%
How's it going.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:31.750 align:middle line:90%
We're real."

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: They're not showing up
in your dreams or anything like

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:90%
that after the fact?

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I've never
had anything like that.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: That's
something people report.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:35.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yeah, I've never
had anything like that happen.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.723 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So we're talking
about conscious transformation

00:23:39.723 --> 00:23:40.550 align:middle line:90%
spirituality.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And how does that relate to
these orbs that you're seeing?

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I've heard a
lot about these orbs.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I know the ones up close you
mentioned could be actual ETs.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:84%
The ones in the
sky might be ships.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:90%
What are these actual orbs?

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Are they connected
to spirituality?

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.730 align:middle line:90%
Are they ETs themselves?

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Or are they something else, an
interdimensional type entity?

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.730 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's an ET, but
there's a difference there.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I can't sift
through the difference,

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.990 align:middle line:90%
to be honest with you.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Really.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.610 align:middle line:90%
It seems--

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: The only thing
I can see, visual wise,

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes the orbs in the sky
when you have infrared and you

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:84%
look through, you
can see a ship.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:84%
You can actually see
the entirety of it.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But to our vision, it
just looks like an orb.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:16.753 align:middle line:84%
So it's hidden in our
spectrum of regular vision.

00:24:16.753 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK, I get it.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: When you look in
the IR, you can see this ship,

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.890 align:middle line:90%
its entirety.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not like there's a light to
it you can see the entire ship.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:84%
That orb is the ship, but you
can only see the energy from it,

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.305 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm thinking.

00:24:28.305 --> 00:24:29.105 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:24:29.105 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Now, I don't know
the answers to that until

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:84%
somebody can back that up or
somebody understands exactly

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:84%
what I'm saying and can
articulate more in a scientific

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:90%
view, if there is.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
from what I personally

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.450 align:middle line:84%
have been able to see
is, if I see an orb

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.617 align:middle line:84%
and I have night vision and
I can look at it and see

00:24:44.617 --> 00:24:46.210 align:middle line:90%
there's a ship there, then yes.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:47.730 align:middle line:84%
As far as a being,
I have not really

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:84%
looked at night
vision on the ground

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:84%
because it gets very
difficult at that point.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And when these
orbs are up close,

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.210 align:middle line:84%
have you ever tried to initiate
like a two-way conversation with

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: No.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: No?

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.203 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: That's one of the
things I'm wanting to work

00:24:59.203 --> 00:25:00.530 align:middle line:90%
on, is learning how to do that.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And some of these scientists
know how to do that.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.137 align:middle line:84%
So picking their brain
on how to do this

00:25:04.137 --> 00:25:08.148 align:middle line:84%
is my next evolution as far as
trying to refine this skill.

00:25:08.148 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: I know a lot of people
are curious about how to make

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:11.490 align:middle line:90%
contact.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I know there's protocols
you can look up online,

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:84%
but do you have any practical
techniques or protocols you

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:90%
can share with us right now?

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.185 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Now, the
way I can describe this,

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:24.560 align:middle line:84%
literally get into a meditative
state to where you can escape

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:90%
from your body.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So to achieve that, I
was visualizing myself

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:84%
like I could see my body
like right up above me.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Like I was just like
Google Earth type.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I could
see the roof of the house.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:90%
I could see the street.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm
zooming out to where

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:84%
I can see where one of
the main intersections

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.240 align:middle line:90%
that were closest to us.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I could see
Sloan's lake there.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I could see downtown
Denver lit up,

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and I can just
start scrolling out

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and just basically to where
I see the entire state.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I can see the entire
country lit up,

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.600 align:middle line:84%
all the-- you can
see all the lights

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.460 align:middle line:84%
through the East Coast
and the West Coast.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:84%
You can see where the entire
countries are also lit up too.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I zoom out and I
can see where the sun is.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I can see Mars, I can
see the other planets.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I can see our entire solar
system as an entirety.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:14.133 align:middle line:84%
I can then zoom out and I
can see the entire galaxy.

00:26:14.133 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I can start
zooming out and see

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.020 align:middle line:90%
multiple different galaxies.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And then when I'm
up to that point,

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and this is when
basically it's like I'm

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.940 align:middle line:84%
putting a connection
out there like,

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
"hey, if you're
right next to me,

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.500 align:middle line:90%
this is where I'm located at.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Can you show yourselves here?"

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm out in space,
and I can feel a connection.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So then it's like
you're sending a light

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:84%
or a laser up in
the sky where you're

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.480 align:middle line:90%
signaling where you're at.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I start to
feel that connection is made.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.817 align:middle line:84%
Then I open my eyes
and I'm looking, trying

00:26:46.817 --> 00:26:47.900 align:middle line:90%
to figure out where it is.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
they just appear and they're

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.200 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.367 align:middle line:84%
There's been some times
where we've been doing this,

00:26:52.367 --> 00:26:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and I look straight up and
you see these white orbs that

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.380 align:middle line:84%
have tails on them that
are moving like this,

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.380 align:middle line:90%
and they just disappear.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.422 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you look at
them, they just disappear.

00:27:00.422 --> 00:27:03.560 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the most common
ones that I used usually to see.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Wow, so in your
mind, you drift up into space,

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.875 align:middle line:84%
you feel or elicit a connection,
and then you kind of like,

00:27:09.875 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
let them know where
you are, basically.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah, physically.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And you
physically let them know.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.882 align:middle line:84%
And then they appear because
they can travel instantaneously.

00:27:15.882 --> 00:27:18.423 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I'm trying to get
everybody on the same page with

00:27:18.423 --> 00:27:20.980 align:middle line:84%
this because I was the biggest
non-believer of this prior,

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.110 align:middle line:90%
if there's any experiences.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.605 align:middle line:84%
I thought anybody who talked
about the subject was loony.

00:27:25.605 --> 00:27:28.230 align:middle line:84%
But then when I started to have
that event in '09 and I started

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.105 align:middle line:84%
having these experiences,
and now it's like--

00:27:30.105 --> 00:27:33.750 align:middle line:84%
it feels like it's my calling
and my mission to get this out

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.470 align:middle line:84%
so people can actually get
this and do this on their own.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Don't take my word for it.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Learn how you can
meditate yourself and get

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.870 align:middle line:84%
to the point where if you
have to look online or even

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.992 align:middle line:84%
listen to what I've
talked about previously.

00:27:45.992 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you get into that
state of consciousness

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.172 align:middle line:84%
and you can make contact
and have it for yourself,

00:27:50.172 --> 00:27:52.130 align:middle line:84%
you'll be another person
who's a believer, too.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:90%
I promise people that.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.390 align:middle line:84%
They just have to take
the veil off themselves,

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and they have to
believe it first,
