>> GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, George Noory,
and I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:10%
Time travel technologies--
do they exist?

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:10%
And if so, how are
they being used?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.576 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:30.576 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.991 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Time
travel technologies--

00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:35.660 align:middle line:90%
exactly what is it?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.670 align:middle line:90%
And what's involved with it?

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, what they're
trying to do and replicate is

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:84%
portal technology that they
have discovered from an earthly

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.120 align:middle line:84%
origin a very,
very long time ago.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And there is a connection
between this type

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:84%
of traveling that also
affects time and space.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So they are trying to actually
replicate that, and make that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:84%
into electronics, and make
a synthetic version of this.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.890 align:middle line:90%
And they have.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:90%
They have actually done this.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.131 align:middle line:90%
They have not perfected it yet.

00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Now,
when you say "they,"

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:90%
who are we talking about?

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: We're talking about
the compartmentalized projects

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that the security is only run
by the military but the project

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:84%
itself could be owned by
major corporations that are

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
clandestine that get funded
by the governments around

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.850 align:middle line:84%
the world to make other
technologies for them,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
whether it be for wartime,
peacetime, or pharmaceutical.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So these monies that are made
from these smaller projects

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.410 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing funds
their secret projects,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.464 align:middle line:84%
such as time travel
and things like this.

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: So
specifically, Emery,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.860 align:middle line:90%
how does time travel work?

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Because we hear
all kinds of things

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.751 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of possibilities.

00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, the first thing
you need is a lot of energy,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:90%
number one.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the side effects
of these zero-point energy

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
overunity devices create this
type of rip in time and space.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with infolding
space on itself, actually,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and opening up the space
within time right here

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.120 align:middle line:84%
in front of you, because
that right there is

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.850 align:middle line:84%
how our extraterrestrials
actually

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%
travel through the universe
and interdimensionally.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:84%
They're creating their own field
of energy, number one, which

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.580 align:middle line:84%
is their own gravitational
field that they sit in.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
That's why they can do
these billion mile an hour

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
right-hand turns
and nothing happens

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
to them, because they're
in their own field.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And by putting energy
and focusing it

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:84%
in front of these
craft, they can actually

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
open up interdimensionally
a space rift in time

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:90%
and go through it.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
sometimes just--

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:90%
poof-- disappear in space.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Do they have
a dial on any apparatus,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.316 align:middle line:84%
and they could click to 3015,
and poof, you'll show up there?

00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, it's
kind of like that,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.169 align:middle line:84%
but it's called consciousness
assisted technology.

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's all done with
their consciousness.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:84%
The craft also are
integrated with the beings.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are actually
grown, these craft,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and they are matched to
the DNA of the pilot.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So all the pilot
has to do is think

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
of that dial turning to 350,
whatever, degrees, and poof!

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: There they are.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yep.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.705 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: The more and
more I watch you on "Cosmic

00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure," I hear new
information that just boggles

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:90%
my mind.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
case, how do they

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:90%
use this kind of technology?

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, what they're
doing is-- like I said,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:84%
time is a very sensitive
subject with the physicists

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and the scientists around
the world that are not part

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:84%
of the clandestine projects,
because it's a hard thing

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.630 align:middle line:84%
to grasp, because time
really doesn't exist.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on is there's
multiple levels of time

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.600 align:middle line:84%
right now and multiple
different types of realities

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:90%
and dimensions.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
dimension right now,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.630 align:middle line:84%
just within a
different frequency

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.839 align:middle line:84%
right now, where you
are here, and I'm here,

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's just a
little bit different.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe these coffee cups are
not here or the cameras.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Or it might be some
different people.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Because there's many
different levels.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
The hardest thing to explain
is that time is irrelevant,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.700 align:middle line:84%
because you are already here
everywhere, all the time, which

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.516 align:middle line:90%
means--

00:04:11.516 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:90%
I know it sounds confusing.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: But don't go back
and see your grandfather, right?

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big question I get.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Like, what if you go back in
time and you did something?

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, you just created
another time reality.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's another space of time.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But you're still where
you're at right now.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you think you can go
back, and remove the coffee

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
mug, and then all of a
sudden it's not there,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work that way at all.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: I mean, if you
wanted to go back into time,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and do away with Hitler,
and prevent World War II,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and the Holocaust, and all
that horror that he created,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:84%
what would happen if
you went back into time,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
took care of him,
got rid of him?

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And what would the
consequences be?

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Consequences
would not affect you,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.792 align:middle line:84%
because in this reality,
that never happened.

00:04:58.792 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Interesting.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But would there be a
reality somewhere--

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: There is.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: --where
it did happen?

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Correct.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.385 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And what
would happen there?

00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, it's
what's happening right now.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the paradigm
here, is trying

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
to put all that
together, saying, OK,

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
there are multiple
dimensional realities,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and there's multiple
different types of time zones

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:90%
that we are all part of.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:84%
We are interdimensional
multiple-dimension beings.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's where frequency
comes in with DNA, and genetics,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and how we affect other
worlds and other places

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, where the
light we see from the stars

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
today, that star
might already be out.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
But because of this
distance and time continuum,

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
we don't really think about
that and realize that.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What if there
are other universes,

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:90%
the multiverse exists--

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, right.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: --would different
time things occur in those

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:90%
different universes?

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right, exactly.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:90%
I get that question a lot too.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So the different universes
have another George

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:90%
and another Emery there.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And at this time,
you have to realize

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
that it's a whole other timeline
that we're part of but we're

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:90%
not because we're here.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:84%
That is the best
way I could put it.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.864 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: These programs--

00:06:11.864 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I'll call them the
"time programs"--

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Sure.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: --were you involved
with them specifically?

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.840 align:middle line:90%
And if so, what did you do?

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, there was a
program I was involved with

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:84%
where they were using a
special type of Teslatron unit,

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
where we would take a watch in
with us in this small hexagon

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:84%
room and spend supposedly
55 minutes in there.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
first time after working

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
with this project for
many years to even become

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.071 align:middle line:84%
one of the people to go into
it that you have two watches.

00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And you put one in
your locker room.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:90%
You lock it up.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.909 align:middle line:84%
You take the other one
with you into this device.

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And the first time,
after waiting two years

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:84%
to get into it,
I was so thankful

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.340 align:middle line:84%
that I was finally able to get
the proper security clearance

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:90%
and to get into this device.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And going into this
device, as they ramp it up,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I remember hearing
after just 15 minutes

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.290 align:middle line:84%
this knock at the door
saying, OK, Smith, you

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:90%
can come out now.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:90%
We're done.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I heard the
system ramp up and--

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You probably were in
there nine years, and never--

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.095 align:middle line:90%
didn't know it, right?

00:07:16.095 --> 00:07:17.095 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Well, exactly.

00:07:17.095 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:90%
I was in there for a whole hour.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:90%
So I got--

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What
did it feel like?

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: When I came
out, I was so upset.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I was so distraught,
saying, man, what happened?

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Did the system
have a malfunction?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And then all the scientists
are looking at each other,

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.843 align:middle line:84%
and they're all over a
hundred years of age.

00:07:30.843 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:90%
And they're laughing.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, didn't
you check your watch

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:90%
in your locker?

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.052 align:middle line:84%
So I missed a good
30, 45 minutes.

00:07:38.052 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And
didn't even know it.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.051 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And I did not know
it, because the 15 minutes I was

00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:44.332 align:middle line:90%
in there, really, I felt--

00:07:44.332 --> 00:07:45.540 align:middle line:90%
it was an amazing experience.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.650 align:middle line:90%
You can see the universe.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:90%
You could see space.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
You could-- it actually detoxes
you and teletransports toxins

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:90%
out of your body.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.404 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people lose up
to 15 pounds on these trips

00:07:57.404 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:90%
that they go in there.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.403 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: In one sitting?

00:07:59.403 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: In one
sitting, in 55 minutes.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And I always asked,
where does that go?

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I still had the
same hydration when they did

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:90%
the blood test.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not dehydrated,
but yet, all

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:84%
the horrible negative
ionic bacteria,

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:84%
viruses, and metals in
my body were taken out.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.509 align:middle line:84%
So people that are really
toxic that go in there, really

00:08:21.509 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the stuff gets--

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: They
come back healthy.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.124 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Right, they
come back very healthy.

00:08:25.124 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It's used to treat cancers
for the elites of the world.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Even our presidents
have been there.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What's the
machine look like, Emery?

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It's a hexagon room.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And inside the hexagon
room is a glass wall.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.449 align:middle line:84%
The hexagon room is only
about eight feet in diameter.

00:08:42.449 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: So it's small.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So it can only
fit a small massage table

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:90%
that's in there.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And three feet beyond
the massage table

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:84%
is a three-inch glass
or Plexiglas wall.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And behind that is this
giant Teslatron unit.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And it amps up this amazing
electromagnetic frequency,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:84%
where it rips time
and space apart.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of side effects of
zero-point energy devices

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:90%
do this.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of scientists,
including Tesla,

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:84%
have witnessed this
and wrote this down,

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.860 align:middle line:84%
that there's some field,
this sphere that forms,

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:84%
which has happened to me in my
laboratories, where the time is

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:90%
getting distorted for a moment.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Sure.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: But with this device,
they really perfected it pretty

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.090 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.506 align:middle line:84%
We always were
trying to find out,

00:09:25.506 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:84%
wow, there must be some
dimension somewhere

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:84%
where someone's sitting there,
maybe an extraterrestrial,

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and a big wad of fat
comes down and hits them

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:90%
in the face or some toxins.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: [LAUGHS]

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.545 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Someone just
dumps a bucket of something.

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's not perfected
yet, because they're still

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out,
well, where does that go?

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Where did the tumor go?

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Where did the cancer
go, the cells?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.397 align:middle line:90%
Where did these viruses go?

00:09:49.397 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: So they're just gone.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: They're just gone.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.771 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: How does it work
in terms of curing people?

00:09:54.771 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They're still
trying to figure it out.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And the best way I
could describe it is it

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:84%
somehow attracts the
negative ionic components

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:84%
of viruses, and
tumors, and also metals

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.380 align:middle line:84%
that are not beneficial
for the body.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.600 align:middle line:84%
It latches on to them somehow
through this energy field

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:90%
that's in there.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And it teletransports
those things out somewhere.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: It sounds like it
also changes the bad cells.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Does it?

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I don't think
it changes the bad cells.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure it
removes the bad cells.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
But it upregulates the
frequency of the DNA.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And it also helps fight
infections and things

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Usually, once you get out of
one of these devices, for me,

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I could not sleep for three
days and be completely fine.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:84%
You have a great
urge to work out.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
I think I ran the furthest
after having a treatment on one

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.990 align:middle line:84%
of these devices, because
I used to jog a lot

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and work out a lot.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And that was very noticeable.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:90%
And they said this would happen.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:84%
They said, you will have an
immense amount of energy,

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and you will have an immense
amount of cognitive function.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:90%
And meditation was just amazing.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
You can immediately
just close your eyes

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and be anywhere you want,
if you were a good meditator

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and you knew how to do just
regular meditation steps.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So it has amazing
functionality to the frequency

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.500 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA of the cell and
the nucleolus of the cell

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and also upregulating
those energies,

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.380 align:middle line:84%
because it's all about keeping
your body at the right voltage.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think by removing
the contaminants out

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
of the body, which
affects your voltage,

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.132 align:middle line:90%
it allows you to heal yourself.

00:11:35.132 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Interesting.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: In our studies,
just with this one project--

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.933 align:middle line:84%
and there's many projects
we'll talk about--

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:42.270 align:middle line:84%
but with this specific
project, you're

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:84%
really going in
there to get treated

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.240 align:middle line:90%
for something, for an ailment.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: OK.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: But what the
side effect is, is time.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Right.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It's losing time.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: You lose time.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:90%
But you don't age, right?

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all
these scientists

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:90%
in this underground facility--

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.440 align:middle line:84%
in New York, actually--
were so young,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and vibrant, and over
a hundred years of age.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And I remember working
on some things for them

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
just as a technician, listening
to their conversations,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.732 align:middle line:84%
and they were talking
like they knew Tesla.

00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:90%
And they had a lot of--

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: They probably did.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I know.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:90%
And it was electrifying to know.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I wish I really knew
exactly how old they were.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
civilian-owned device

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that was made from naval
scientists that retired early.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And it must be so
perfected now, I would guess,

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I think
they're trying to do something.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I tried to contact
them a few years ago

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:84%
to see if we could maybe
get this technology out

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.610 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And one of the head
scientists became ill,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.284 align:middle line:84%
and I have lost contact
with that group.

00:12:49.284 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:84%
But we're still trying
to figure it out.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to resurface soon,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.390 align:middle line:84%
because the medical benefits
of this time traveling device

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.160 align:middle line:90%
is unprecedented.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.664 align:middle line:84%
They were able to cure HIV
in 30 days, herpes in--

00:13:02.664 --> 00:13:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: By being
in the device?

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Just by being in
the device three times a week.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Does it
cure everything?

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.716 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I don't
know about everything.

00:13:09.716 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Just the documentation
I've seen and heard

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:17.334 align:middle line:84%
was with cancers, and
herpes, and HIV, STDs.

00:13:17.334 --> 00:13:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Because a lot of the--

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Well, why do they
suppress all that stuff, Emery?

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they bring
it to the public?

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, the FDA will
definitely not approve that

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:84%
device, no matter how much
documentation they have.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Why?

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, you're
going up against big pharma,

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:90%
the big moneymaker.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:84%
They need you to
take these pills.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:32.880 align:middle line:90%
They don't--

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: So you're saying
they don't want the cures.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.311 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They do
not want the cures.

00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And I can attest to
that, being the inventor

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:84%
of the first tabletop
stem cell concentrator

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and submitting many
documents to the FDA

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.575 align:middle line:84%
of helping paralyzed patients
and things like this.

00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And you could send in a thousand
studies of a new technology

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.916 align:middle line:84%
that many scientists
have tried to do--

00:13:57.916 --> 00:13:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Of course.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: --here in
the United States--

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: And nothing happens.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: --and nothing happens.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, well,
you need more data.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So they just keep leading
you on, leading you on

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.968 align:middle line:84%
till you get so tired
and you run out of money.

00:14:06.968 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Because most scientists
and smaller corporations

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:84%
don't have that kind of capital
to keep testing, and testing,

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:90%
and testing.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Emery, we've talked
about these scientists that you

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:84%
would see through
this time device.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And you said they were
a hundred years old.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Where'd they come from?

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.830 align:middle line:90%
And why were they so old?

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, it's not
when I was inside the device.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones who
invented this device.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And they were definitely
born on Earth.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.827 align:middle line:84%
They were all ex-military
scientists that retired--

00:14:35.827 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: May have
worked with Tesla.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They obviously
had worked with Tesla,

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.930 align:middle line:84%
the way I can hear them talking
behind the scenes and joking

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:84%
They were all in
excellent shape.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.450 align:middle line:84%
They were all over a
hundred years of age.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:90%
They were still aging.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
They didn't get that
secret figured out yet.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that these people
in these compartmentalized

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:84%
projects who have
been there forever--

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.494 align:middle line:84%
by the way, these
are civilian-owned

00:15:00.494 --> 00:15:02.160 align:middle line:84%
compartmentalized
projects, but they are

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.057 align:middle line:90%
ran by ex-military scientists.

00:15:05.057 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Emery,
how advanced are we,

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:84%
in your opinion and
based on things you saw,

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:90%
is our time travel program?

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.660 align:middle line:90%
How advanced is it?

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well,
they can do it, OK?

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
effective, such as--

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I would probably
say a recent offer

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I got to come back to a project
because the entire team had

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.195 align:middle line:84%
passed away during one of the
missions, and it has a very--

00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: They died?

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The mortality
rate, it's not that great.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.645 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Something happened
during the experiment?

00:15:35.645 --> 00:15:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Something happened.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.212 align:middle line:84%
And these were people I had
known for 20 years or more.

00:15:39.212 --> 00:15:41.628 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You seem a little
emotional talking about this.

00:15:41.628 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, they were
very close friends of mine

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:90%
in the projects.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I have not talked
to them in forever.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But when I was notified of this
position, first thing I asked

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.870 align:middle line:84%
was, well, how is
commander so-and-so,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
how is this person,
how is that person?

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
there was an incident.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Oh, jeez.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: And then I knew.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And they just said,
that's why we want you.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And so just like
an astronaut that

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.964 align:middle line:84%
goes up to space to risk
his life or to the moon--

00:16:06.964 --> 00:16:09.463 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And they go there
knowing they may not come back.

00:16:09.463 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They go there knowing
that you might have just a 70%

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:90%
chance of survival.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:84%
There is these
numbers and ratios

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:90%
that scientists come up with.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's not worth
me right now getting

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:84%
involved with these projects
anymore because it's

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.920 align:middle line:84%
too dangerous because
of everything I'm

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:90%
trying to get out to the world.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.510 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it's
good to know that they're still

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:84%
working on these
projects to help figure

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:84%
out the physics behind
them and the science.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these projects
have mission-oriented goals

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:90%
for time travel.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:84%
One of the missions I had
been on as a young sergeant

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
was to go through these types of
portals and time travel devices

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
to just collect certain amount
of rocks, and dirt, and flora,

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.210 align:middle line:90%
and fauna.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: From the past
and the future, I guess.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know where
exactly I was on the planet

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:90%
or even if I was on this planet.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And we would only be gone--

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
it was always a specific
15 minutes in and out.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
But as we'd get back, we'd
be gone three or four hours

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.269 align:middle line:90%
in real time, at this time.

00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:14.069 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.902 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: In real--

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:84%
but when you came back,
how much time had gone by?

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.134 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Three or four hours.

00:17:18.134 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Three or four.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I was only
gone 15 minutes.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Oh, OK.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And then everyone
gets pulled out, and--

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.491 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: That's not too long.

00:17:23.491 --> 00:17:26.195 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you came back and
40 years had gone by, right?

00:17:26.195 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:90%
But I know space travel--

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.330 align:middle line:84%
this is where it gets
into the big time thing,

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.040 align:middle line:84%
with the further you
go away from the Earth,

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
that you're losing
time because time here

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:90%
is speeding up as you're not.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Correct.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yep.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Emery, these
missions are not very long--

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:90%
10 to 15 minutes at a burst.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:84%
What are they doing
with these missions?

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.910 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, like I said,
each mission is different.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the few
missions I was on was

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:84%
to go there and collect some
plant life, and some rocks,

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.696 align:middle line:90%
and some soil material.

00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: To get
in, to get out.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And to
get in and get out.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the cool things that had
happened on one of the missions

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:10.730 align:middle line:84%
is they had this giant leaf,
almost three feet in diameter,

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:90%
like a vine leaf.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was
bullet-proof, this leaf.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Bullet-proof?

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Bullet-proof.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:90%
The actual leaf--

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: It was that strong.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It wasn't thick at
all, but it was that strong.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
reverse technologies now

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
you see here today come from
these amazing excursions

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
into time and through
these portals.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of the latest
things that has just

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
been published in the last two
weeks was they took a plant,

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and they removed all
of its inner contents

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and just left the cellulose
material of that plant

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:90%
clear as a bell.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
inject into this plant,

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:90%
into the veins, liquid.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same type of
vessels, the way it's laid out,

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:90%
as we have in our own body.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Remarkable.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Have you traveled in
time backward in time

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:90%
and forward in time?

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I don't know if I was
traveling backward or forward,

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:84%
because I was never around
people or any types of--

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.760 align:middle line:84%
anything that I could tell
that it was Earth, known--

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: It's not like you
could look at a calendar that

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.980 align:middle line:84%
said 1804 or
something like that.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It wasn't like
what's-his-name on "Back

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:84%
to the Future" where he
could type something in.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Michael J. Fox, yeah.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.780 align:middle line:84%
You can't-- it's not
like that at all.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.121 align:middle line:90%
It's a great concept.

00:19:31.121 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't perfected it,
that they want to go back

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:90%
at this specific time.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
experimenting, that they

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.980 align:middle line:90%
know people are losing time.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And because they can take some
sort of electronics with them

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.950 align:middle line:84%
now, which they weren't
able to do in the past,

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and see that hey, we've
only been gone 15 minutes,

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.540 align:middle line:84%
but we get back, and
it's been four hours.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:90%
What is that about?

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the physics
behind that to explain it.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Did anything ever
go wrong with you when you were

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:90%
doing this?

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Not me personally,
but there was one person

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:84%
on our team for some reason did
not come back through the time

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.680 align:middle line:90%
continuum device.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
happened to them.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:90%
This happens sometimes.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a fine line
when you're walking

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:84%
in through these devices
within four to six feet.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you go off of
that line, you're gone.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:90%
So you have to--

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.900 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of protocols
involving getting

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.400 align:middle line:90%
through one of these devices.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: When you arrive
at a destiny in time,

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.229 align:middle line:90%
do you go through a portal?

00:20:32.229 --> 00:20:34.145 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Oh, that's a
good-- that's a great--

00:20:34.145 --> 00:20:35.728 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Is that
what it looks like?

00:20:35.728 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah,
it's like a veil.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like you
see in these movies,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.870 align:middle line:84%
where there's this giant star
gate with all these flashing

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:44.890 align:middle line:90%
lights.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
It really is a clear,
blurry veil, just a veil

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:90%
like a curtain in front of you.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And I can see right
through it and see you.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Like, if the veil was in front
of me, I could still see you,

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:90%
but it's a blur.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:90%
It's like a blurry--

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
like a Plexiglas
you're looking through.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.185 align:middle line:84%
And soon as you walk through
it, you're not there anymore.

00:21:05.185 --> 00:21:06.310 align:middle line:90%
You're at your destination.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Poof!

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:90%
You're gone.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Or you're gone.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: So how
do you come back?

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, you just turn
around, and at that spot

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:84%
is the special spot to get
back, whether it be at a site

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:15.850 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: OK.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Usually, a lot
of these things are already

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:84%
of earthly origin, meaning like
a Stonehenge-type formation.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:84%
The mechanical ones
look like they're metal.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.970 align:middle line:84%
They look like a
picture frame, actually.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.667 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What if you get lost
and you can't find that spot?

00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, that's why these
missions are limited to about

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes, and they
only go to certain areas.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So you really can't run
too far in 15 minutes.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: OK.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't go far.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And you
might be in a desert.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:90%
You might be in a tropical zone.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.890 align:middle line:90%
You might be in an arctic zone.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.050 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on
what the mission is.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And all the missions
I've been on,

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.940 align:middle line:84%
they've already had
people go on these.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:90%
So we had videos and pictures.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And we knew what type of flora
and fauna we were looking at

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and what to collect as far as
crystals, and rocks, and things

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.835 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:22:04.835 --> 00:22:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Who's
behind these programs,

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.870 align:middle line:90%
these time travel programs?

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: There's 300 major
corporations that run this

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And these corporations, a
very small handful of them

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:84%
are involved with the highest
tech stuff that's out there.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
it's them that have

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:90%
conquered this type of stuff.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:84%
They have also conquered
reverse engineering a lot

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial craft,
creating interdimensional craft

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:84%
that can go interdimensionally,
which also is a time travel

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.380 align:middle line:90%
type of thing.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.921 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Are they
still doing this?

00:22:37.921 --> 00:22:41.129 align:middle line:84%
And if they are, how
advanced are they now?

00:22:41.129 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, as
of six months ago,

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.800 align:middle line:84%
when I was offered
this position,

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.760 align:middle line:90%
they're still doing it.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So we know it's
still a hot item.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.060 align:middle line:84%
They're still trying to
work out the quirks of it.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't know
the physics behind this,

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:90%
you could cause a lot of damage.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And you can also bring back
things that are not safe.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Aren't you
concerned for yourself, Emery?

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're
talking about things

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:84%
that are supposed to be
covert, I would assume,

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:90%
that are supposed to be secret.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And you're risking a lot coming
forward talking about this.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Do you look over your
shoulder sometimes?

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, I'm always
on high alert, of course.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:84%
The attacks have slowed
down significantly

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:84%
ever since I stopped teaching
about the zero-point energy

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:84%
devices and stopped really
talking and inventing

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:84%
new cellular devices
that help you heal.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Since I've already have patents
and all these things behind me,

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's a general public
about my free energy lab

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:90%
I used to run--

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:84%
also, the devices
that I invented

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.880 align:middle line:84%
there have been turned
over to other corporations,

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:84%
that I have given them
and still helping them

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.920 align:middle line:90%
develop it and perfect it.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.280 align:middle line:90%
It is a very scary thing.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.080 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the reason the head-on
collision happened to me

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
was because I was transporting
a zero-point energy

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.860 align:middle line:90%
device after it was validated.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think that being said
and coming forward in November

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.270 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of this
information, I

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:84%
think it was the protection
of the general public

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and people knowing, hey,
now if they kill me,

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to look like a martyr.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Oh, no
question about it.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It's just
going to be horrible.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.266 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's definitely
going to know now.

00:24:25.266 --> 00:24:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And recently, we
were gathering up

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:84%
about a few hundred
documents that

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
had been left over from my
house being raided that we're

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.870 align:middle line:90%
going to show to the public.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: That's what they
did to Tesla when he died, too,

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:37.490 align:middle line:90%
same thing.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.539 align:middle line:84%
But I'm doing it ahead
of time, hopefully.

00:24:40.539 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Emery, tell me
specifically about this

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:43.380 align:middle line:90%
accident.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.200 align:middle line:90%
What actually happened?

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, for many
months in California,

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
I was working at an undisclosed
location facility that was

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.420 align:middle line:90%
helping me validate a system.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.140 align:middle line:84%
We were able to validate
the system properly.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
So right after that,
after an agreement

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:84%
was made for an exchange of
other technologies for them

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:05.650 align:middle line:84%
to validate the system, I put it
in the back of the Range Rover

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and headed down the
mountain, I'll say.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Aha.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.229 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And someone came
out from around the corner--

00:25:12.229 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Intentionally?

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.019 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Intentionally,
with a long--

00:25:16.019 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:84%
we had a lot of time to think
about what was going to happen.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.287 align:middle line:84%
But there's a canyon wall on
the right with just 3 feet.

00:25:21.287 --> 00:25:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Oh, jeez.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And this person was
not going to get back in his

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:24.750 align:middle line:90%
lane.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.730 align:middle line:84%
So I just had a
moment-- second to turn.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
vicious head-on collision

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:90%
of over 55 miles an hour.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:32.779 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Oh!

00:25:32.779 --> 00:25:34.070 align:middle line:90%
You're lucky you're still here.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, my hand went
through the side window.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:90%
And I had a concussion.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Lots of lacerations, of course.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:84%
With any type of a
head-on collision,

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:84%
you're pretty sore
for quite a while.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So I was out of work
for about three weeks

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:90%
and really couldn't do much.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.530 align:middle line:84%
The thing was the
device was spared,

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.200 align:middle line:84%
thank goodness, and was
immediately transported

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.320 align:middle line:84%
to a safe place by another
investor and a security

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:84%
team that was helping
me out at that time.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And now it's in a very
safe place, in safe hands.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: OK.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And the
information with that,

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:84%
it's a very fantastic thing,
because they're going to come

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.380 align:middle line:84%
out next year, hopefully
maybe March, April,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and show the public my device
and what we have done with

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.150 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: That'll
be fascinating.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: --to help the world
in a safe and effective way.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:10%
Because I'm not out there
teaching anyone how to do this,

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:10%
like the Bedini brothers were.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:10%
And that's why
they got taken out.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And these are two
other scientists

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that were trying to help get
these energy devices out.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But I was visited a very
long time ago by the suits,

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and they said, we know
what you're doing.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.600 align:middle line:90%
We don't care.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Don't sell it.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:49.135 align:middle line:90%
Don't teach people how to do it.

00:26:49.135 --> 00:26:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And don't hook it
up to the grid.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: And you'll be OK.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: And you'll be fine.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:90%
So I--

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Do any one of
those three, then look out.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.441 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I've never done that.

00:26:56.441 --> 00:26:58.141 align:middle line:90%
So I've been very adamant.

00:26:58.141 --> 00:27:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What other countries
are involved in time travel?

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.740 align:middle line:90%
It can't be just us.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The only ones I
can verify is Germany, China,

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:84%
United States of America,
and a couple of facilities

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
in Australia are trying to
duplicate that that I know

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:84%
of first- and
second-hand information.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.590 align:middle line:90%
There might be others--

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:84%
maybe Brazil, maybe England--
but I'm not aware of it.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: I've always wondered
if there are time travelers

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.280 align:middle line:84%
roaming around this planet
right now from the future.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It's a possibility.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:34.490 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Anything is possible when
it comes to time travel.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:41.242 align:middle line:84%
It's just finding out
through these time travelers

00:27:41.242 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and people-- because
I know there's

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.370 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stories out there,
a lot of things going on.

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have agents that
go out through these things,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.830 align:middle line:84%
like Terminator, and go back and
kill so-and-so's son so there's

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:90%
not this president born.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.050 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't work that way.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:84%
If something like
that were to happen,

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.942 align:middle line:90%
it would be on another timeline.

00:28:00.942 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: But don't
they go back, Emery,

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:90%
and try to manipulate time?

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So how do we know that events
that are happening right now--

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
right now-- the
president's meeting

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
with North Korea and
things like that--

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:84%
how do we know that
they weren't manipulated

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.460 align:middle line:90%
by some kind of time event?

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the opinions
out there and one

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:84%
of the hypothetical hypothesis
is that you would not know,

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.750 align:middle line:84%
because, like I was
telling you earlier,

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.360 align:middle line:84%
if someone were to
go change something,

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.610 align:middle line:84%
it would not even
be in your memory.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
think this may--

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and this is just
my educated guess--

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.800 align:middle line:84%
that this is probably happening,
and we wouldn't even know,

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that because of
the field of energy

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:84%
that we're all connected
to, if something

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:52.220 align:middle line:84%
were to change in time, that
you would already be programmed

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.020 align:middle line:90%
to believe that never happened.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:29:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Or that when something
changes and not everyone gets

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the change is what
I'm getting at.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So people are
starting to remember.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:84%
People are starting to be
elevated in their own force

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:84%
field to realize, wait a
second, I'm figuring this out,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:84%
because they're having this
residual memory attached

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.392 align:middle line:90%
to the endless field.

00:29:17.392 --> 00:29:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What would
the motivation be, Emery,

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:90%
of manipulating the timeline?

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Why would they want to
change things like that?

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The megalomaniacs
that run this planet have all

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.880 align:middle line:90%
the money in the world.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.420 align:middle line:84%
They have everything
they could ever want.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is some
sort of disease they have--

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: A game?

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: --that they're
addicted to the secret control

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:84%
factor, not only controlling
the mass population,

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:50.450 align:middle line:84%
but secretly controlling certain
aspects of what can happen

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:54.310 align:middle line:84%
or what could happen if
they changed something.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's a control factor, I
believe, that they may have,

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that they get high off
this type of thing,

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:84%
releasing their own excitement
of adrenaline and dopamine

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.490 align:middle line:84%
in their brain when they
accomplish secret control

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:84%
over an individual or over
a greater population, which

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.726 align:middle line:90%
includes death as well.

00:30:14.726 --> 00:30:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: It's a
power play, isn't it?

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.396 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: The deep state--
we hear so much about the deep

00:30:19.396 --> 00:30:20.280 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Were you involved with them?

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: You were not.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: I'm trying to find
an Emery Smith that may be

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:90%
involved in covert things.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:30.627 align:middle line:90%
But that's not you.

00:30:30.627 --> 00:30:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, of course, I was
involved with a lot of covert

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.010 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But I don't use the pop
culture term "deep state."

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.480 align:middle line:84%
When I was an active
duty member and also

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:84%
a contract member
of corporations,

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I was never doing
anything that was negative

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.860 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So the deep state, I stay
away from that kind of term,

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.640 align:middle line:84%
because for many
of my colleagues

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and military veteran
people who have

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:58.980 align:middle line:84%
been on lots of secret
missions and things like this,

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.880 align:middle line:84%
we don't think of it that
way, in agents, and spies,

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.020 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.210 align:middle line:84%
We have a job, and
we're supposed to do it.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time
you don't know really

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:09.900 align:middle line:90%
why you're doing it.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the reasons
I got away from all that,

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.689 align:middle line:84%
because it's
upsetting if you knew

00:31:16.689 --> 00:31:18.480 align:middle line:84%
you were a part of
something that maybe was

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.510 align:middle line:90%
negative towards a person or--

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Especially when
you're a good person.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, to the
person or to the planet.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But to my knowledge,
I'm not aware of any

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.929 align:middle line:90%
of that in my career.

00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Do you remember
the original movie "The Time

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Machine," where the professor
invented a time device,

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.130 align:middle line:90%
and he sat in it?

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:43.110 align:middle line:84%
In this particular case, the
apparatus to create time travel

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.420 align:middle line:90%
creates these portals.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But you don't physically need to
take a device with you, do you?

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:52.704 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, no, because
the device is already there.

00:31:52.704 --> 00:31:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you
brought this up--

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And it
stays there, right?

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:84%
It stays there in the
field, in its own field.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
first times we got

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:84%
one of these overunity
zero-point energy devices going

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:09.900 align:middle line:84%
in the lab, this sphere
formed about 10 or 15 feet

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.370 align:middle line:90%
around the device.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And myself and the scientists
were in this sphere.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember looking
through this liquid sphere

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:90%
as we're inside a hollow sphere.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:90%
But it's like a liquid.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.251 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Like a bubble?

00:32:22.251 --> 00:32:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Like a bubble.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And we could see different
times of the planet.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we saw dinosaurs.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:10%
We saw beings.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:10%
>> GEORGE: Wow!

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:32.640 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: We saw beings
and things through this,

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.290 align:middle line:10%
like a window.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.123 align:middle line:10%
Wherever you would look,
you could see this.

00:32:35.123 --> 00:32:36.660 align:middle line:90%
And it was so captivating.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.900 align:middle line:84%
It was only for a
brief 15 seconds.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:90%
But it was like, wow.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.610 align:middle line:84%
We just opened some sort
of time rift or something.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually
viewing the planet

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.610 align:middle line:84%
right now as it was millions,
and millions, and millions

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:51.660 align:middle line:90%
of years ago.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: What a sight!

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:53.940 align:middle line:90%
What a sight.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:57.420 align:middle line:84%
With time travel, is there
that possibility that--

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.600 align:middle line:84%
because I think of it
also as teleportation.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Do they send you
to another planet?

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And if they do, what if you
appear without a breathing

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:07.620 align:middle line:90%
device or something?

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.244 align:middle line:90%
What happens to you?

00:33:09.244 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: That's
a great question.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And what they do
is they send drones

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.120 align:middle line:84%
through these thousands
of times before they

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.040 align:middle line:90%
send a human being through.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And some of these are
programmed life forms.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of these are mechanical
drones with cameras on them.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And they go through
these, and they come back.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have actual
recordings of everything.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Also, it's like
sending a satellite

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:84%
or sending the probe to Mars to
analyze the atmosphere and all

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.320 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.490 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.410 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be careful where
you're going to be going into.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do also with
the ley lines of the planet

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and how the stars are aligned
at that time for these portals

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:53.640 align:middle line:84%
to actually operate
correctly and also

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.705 align:middle line:84%
to make it safe for these
people to go through.

00:33:57.705 --> 00:33:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: How fascinating.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.360 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Are you familiar
with Jason Rice?

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: I interviewed
him on "Beyond Belief,"

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and he will be appearing on
future episodes of "Cosmic

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Disclosure."

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.739 align:middle line:84%
Gaia had cameras rolling
when he underwent

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:13.650 align:middle line:90%
hypnosis and a polygraph test--

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:15.910 align:middle line:90%
really remarkable stuff.

00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Amazing.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.850 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to hear.

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:18.891 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Emery, thanks.

00:34:18.891 --> 00:34:21.165 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate you
being on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:34:21.165 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: George, thanks
for having me again.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.489 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Thank
you for watching.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:30.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.159 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.350 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.044 align:middle line:10%
and secret space programs--

00:34:37.044 --> 00:34:39.460 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: I know the satellites
that can project something

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.440 align:middle line:10%
right here with a shadow
and reflect light.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.467 align:middle line:84%
And you will honest-to-God
think that's real.

00:34:43.467 --> 00:34:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: There's a UFO,
and it's not even there.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Exactly.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever killed
an extraterrestrial being?

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They were turning
a human into some sort

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:56.820 align:middle line:84%
of interdimensional
communications device.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> They are very interested
in some of our DNA.
