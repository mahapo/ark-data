>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.850 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired special agent who served

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.170 align:middle line:10%
in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Today we discuss advanced
psychic research.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So, Richard, what
is advanced psychic research?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.285 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It's something the
United States government

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
developed beginning
back in the '70s.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Remote viewing.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:84%
We all heard about
remote viewing.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Stargate developed in
the Stanford laboratory.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.570 align:middle line:84%
The United States
Army took it over

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:90%
and they trained remote viewers.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And from that period
of time, about 1976,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:84%
was when the first
remote viewers actually

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.140 align:middle line:84%
performed operations in
the intelligence arena.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Up until 1995, it rested with
the Defense Intelligence Agency.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
The Defense Intelligence
agency decided

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:84%
they did all they could
with remote viewing.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.520 align:middle line:84%
There has to be something
more than remote viewing.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They put a lot
of money into that, too.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.562 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They put a lot of
money, a lot of effort,

00:01:28.562 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:90%
a lot of training.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.080 align:middle line:84%
But remote viewing is
about 60% to 65% accurate.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not 100%.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Correct.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And nobody ever said
it was going to be 100%.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.935 align:middle line:84%
In the early days, there
were some remote viewers

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:84%
that could foresee things
that were about 90% accurate,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:84%
but that's a far
and few between.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.530 align:middle line:90%
So they needed something else.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So they stopped the program,
turned it over to CIA,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:84%
the CIA says, we'll keep
it for a year or two.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:90%
But the CIA never did.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:84%
But DIA began to--
developing new systems.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:84%
They brought in
clairvoyants and all sorts

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:84%
of other psychic
personnel and tested them

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:84%
in a number of different
arenas over a period of years.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And in 2004, a
scientist out of MIT

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and a physician out of
Johns Hopkins University,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was a neurologist,
found patterns of the brain

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:84%
when they were
training people to do--

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:84%
military people to do different
things in remote viewing.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
They realized that the brain
patterns functioned differently.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And so they keyed on
that, and then they

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
developed newer procedures
or newer techniques.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And in the 2007, they
perfected something called

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:90%
thought projection acquisition.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's still classified--

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:84%
the actual details
of how it works.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know about
it is it works in two ways.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And they call these thought
projection acquisition

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.570 align:middle line:90%
soldiers--

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
They're all military,
some Air Force.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.903 align:middle line:90%
They call them experiencers.

00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Experiencers.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So they sit in
front of a target like you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and they project something
in from their brain

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:84%
into your brain that
opens up your brain

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.220 align:middle line:90%
and then they read it.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.400 align:middle line:90%
They read your brain.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:90%
They're able to do that.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And techniques they use and
that's still classified.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
The second way they
can do it is they

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.750 align:middle line:84%
can project their
mind to another place,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
similar to remote viewing, and
then they can look at something.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's extremely more
accurate than remote viewing,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:90%
this new technique.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:90%
They can actually look inside--

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
an experiment they did from a
facility at Bolling Air Force

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
base to a facility in
Baumholder, West Germany,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:84%
they actually projected
something inside a safe

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:84%
where this experiencer
read the entire document.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:84%
It was classified top
secret out of a safe.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not something
a remote viewer could do.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:84%
The remote viewer
could detect something

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:84%
in that safe that was top
secret, but he couldn't read it.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't read it.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And this new procedure
is far more advanced

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:90%
than remote viewing.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.240 align:middle line:84%
In 2009, they put a new training
class of these experiencers

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:84%
through training at
Bolling Air Force base.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:84%
It lasted an entire year
from June 2009 to June 2010.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And there were 88 that graduated
from that class out of a class

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.660 align:middle line:90%
that started with 100.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure over the years,
there's a lot more than those 88

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And they do highly
classified operations,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:90%
which we don't know about.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that we know
about is what I told you,

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.840 align:middle line:90%
the basics of it.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more to this that
is still classified that we

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.630 align:middle line:90%
haven't--

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:90%
that they haven't released.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.165 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What psychic modalities
are involved with this program?

00:05:14.165 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There's
a number of them.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.740 align:middle line:84%
They call it
trans-spectral positioning.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Trans-spectral
position.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that you
project something

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:84%
from one point, your
brain, to the target brain.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And they call whatever
they're after a target.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.442 align:middle line:90%
And they're able to do this--

00:05:33.442 --> 00:05:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that can
be anywhere, right?

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
across from the person.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Or it does?

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: During an
enhanced interrogation,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.647 align:middle line:90%
this technique is used--

00:05:42.647 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: In interrogation.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Interrogation.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
But when they're looking
for intelligence material,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.760 align:middle line:84%
they can project it
to another location,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:84%
whether it be in inside China
or North Korea or wherever.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:90%
But they can project it.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But you can sit
across from someone,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
say an enhanced interrogation,
you catch for instance,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:84%
a Chinese spy inside
a top secret facility,

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:90%
you bring them out.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Rather than going through
any kind of torture technique

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
or advanced interrogations,
physical advanced interrogation,

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:84%
you can sit in
front of that person

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:84%
without them even putting
up any defense and project

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.160 align:middle line:84%
something into their mind and
then basically read their mind.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So the questions you want
from that target is who, what,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.530 align:middle line:90%
where, when and how and why.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:84%
You can get that from
them through their brain

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
without them ever
speaking a word.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.913 align:middle line:90%
That's utterly fantastic.

00:06:42.913 --> 00:06:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's outstanding.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:90%
That's outstanding.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.518 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But then
there's a lot more to it

00:06:46.518 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't been released.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:84%
That is, I'm sure there's
many, many aspects of this

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.868 align:middle line:84%
that's still highly classified
that we won't know about.

00:06:54.868 --> 00:06:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, pop
culture would refer

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:90%
to this as astral projecting.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.940 align:middle line:84%
We also teach this in CE5
courses where we put you

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:90%
inside the spaceship.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
kind of a similar thing.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, I think it is.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:84%
I think it sounds exactly
like some of the techniques

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:90%
that they use that I've seen.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.505 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You've
seen this, right?

00:07:17.505 --> 00:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Or I've been
told by somebody.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's very little
on the internet about this

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:90%
because it's still classified.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:84%
There's one paper somebody
posted on the internet in 2017,

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:84%
but it sounds more
like science fiction.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Somebody probably
got some information

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and then created something
that is not entirely true.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And that could be, of
course, disinformation.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there an
element of technology

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
involved in that process
when you're sitting across

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:90%
from someone?

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think it's
all psychic technology.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.572 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All psychology, right?

00:07:47.572 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: You can have
psychic technologies.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:90%
The brain can do things.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:84%
If you would-- if you're
capable of operating 30% or 40%

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
of your brain capacity,
you can do things

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.257 align:middle line:90%
that nobody else could do.

00:08:00.257 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And that's a lot.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's a lot.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.265 align:middle line:84%
Considering we're
only about 12%.

00:08:04.265 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 12%, yeah.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So if you-- and what
they train these experiencers is

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:84%
that there's techniques used,
it takes a year to train.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And what they start with
is a selection process.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.360 align:middle line:90%
They select people.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind of criteria
in the selection process

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:90%
that is classified.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what that is.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And even if I did, I
can't talk about it.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:84%
But once the selection
is made, then they

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:84%
go through a very, very, very
detailed physical examination

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:90%
from head to toe.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And they have EKGs, heart
rhythm tests, brain scans,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:90%
CAT scans of their brain.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:84%
They really delve
into the brain.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is
they map the brain.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you know exactly
what we're talking about, Emery.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I sure do.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Then they
start the training.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of the very interesting
parts of the training

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
is they teach these
experiencers to totally clear

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.685 align:middle line:90%
their mind of thought.

00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's the secret.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And how they do
it, I don't know.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're dealing
with a target, the experiencer

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:84%
sitting there and now they're
not thinking about the grocery

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.030 align:middle line:84%
list their wife had
given them or they

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:84%
forgot to take the cat out
or something like that.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Their mind is cleared.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
They're focusing entirely on
that target and that brain

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:90%
inside that target's end.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what opens up
and allows them to go in

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.840 align:middle line:84%
and plant something in there
and some kind of technique

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it a sending
exercise or a receiving

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.693 align:middle line:90%
exercise?

00:09:49.693 --> 00:09:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The first
part of it is sending.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Sending that thought
into the target's brain.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And then they want to
receive back something.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is
it's more like a vacuum.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:90%
They call it a psychic vacuum.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So now you're in
that target's brain.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm in your brain.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for those
thoughts that you're

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:84%
thinking about on that spy
operation you ran and wherever.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, now I'm targeting that.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm in a vacuum and suction
that stuff out into my brain.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:90%
So now I can do my report on it.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's other things
that happen after this.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:84%
There's then an interview or
an interrogation by experts.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Not the TPA experiencer.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Another team of
interrogation experts.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I was trained in

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
was advanced
interrogation techniques.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is talking but you
do it in a different way.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So that you take
that target over here

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.260 align:middle line:90%
and now you're dealing--

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:90%
and that just verifies--

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.900 align:middle line:84%
they verify what this experience
has already got out of this guy.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Of this target.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Have you ever--

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I've read this and
you can verify this.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:84%
For the TPA experiencer,
have they ever

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:84%
put them in like
deprivation tanks

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:84%
or get the body ready where
they're in a dark room

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and
do this projection

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
to, say, go to this underground
facility and tell us

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.730 align:middle line:90%
what's there.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, but the
actual training from the day

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.780 align:middle line:84%
they enter the training session
at Bolling Air Force base

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:84%
in a secure facility, a SCIF
controlled secure facility.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:84%
From that point on to when
they graduate a year later,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.130 align:middle line:90%
everything is classified.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:90%
But some things have leaked out.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And they do isolate the
experiencers in training.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.360 align:middle line:84%
They do put them through
some psychological tests

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and they teach them
how to control release.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:84%
That's called a control
release of emotions.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
how they do that,

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.340 align:middle line:84%
but that's one of the
techniques they use.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's what I read.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.237 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And that helps them to--

00:11:58.237 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Clear their mind.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Clear their mind and
facilitate this interrogation.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Mind and mind interrogation.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And another thing they
do before they actually

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
go into the room with a target,
they're in another place

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.650 align:middle line:84%
doing some things, that
are still classified,

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
to clear themselves
and then bring them in.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the
things that they come in

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:90%
and they don't wear uniforms.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:26.390 align:middle line:84%
They have no military uniforms,
no military anything on them.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:90%
It's just a plain coverall.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a one piece
coverall that they wear.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's probably
something to do.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.870 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about those coveralls

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:90%
which we don't know about.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nobody's leaked
anything out about that.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But every single experiencer
wears a one piece coverall.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why, but there's

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:84%
something about
that that probably

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:90%
sets the target at ease, maybe.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure does.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's too much
busyness going on

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
with medals and uniforms
and flashy things which

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.283 align:middle line:84%
would get your attention
and throw you off.

00:13:01.283 --> 00:13:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's a good point.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:03.290 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What qualities do
they look for this role?

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Are they military?

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Are they civilians?

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:84%
How do they find
these individuals.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Every one
of the experiencers

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:17.110 align:middle line:84%
that graduated in the class, the
first class from 2009 to 2010,

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:90%
were military.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:84%
They came from all branches of
the service, Army, Navy, Marines

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:90%
and Air Force.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.862 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That would make sense.

00:13:24.862 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And they had a really
tough selection process.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:84%
But again, the selection
process is classified.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.620 align:middle line:84%
But what they're
looking for, they

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:84%
don't look for anybody with
any kind of special IQ,

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
but they look for their ability
to perform a psychic tests.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:90%
There's different psychic tests.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Now since this came out, there's
a number of people who have

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
commented about these
tests, psychic tests,

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:84%
that they gave during the remote
viewing era back in the '70s.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:84%
They gave these remote
viewers different types

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:84%
of psychic tests, whether
they could look and see this

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.010 align:middle line:84%
or they close their
eyes and do that.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
some of the tests

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.030 align:middle line:84%
during the selection process
for these experiencers.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.550 align:middle line:90%
But again, it's all classified.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly
what they're looking for.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.530 align:middle line:84%
But as I understand, every one
of these, the 88 that graduated

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.523 align:middle line:90%
are between 25 and 35 years old.

00:14:19.523 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if age
has anything to do with it,

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
but we know that they're
in that 10-year pattern.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them,
when they started,

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.860 align:middle line:90%
they were 25, between 25 and 30.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's a year course--

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:90%
35, and that's a year course.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What agency
controls the TPA.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Defense
Intelligence Agency.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ah, DIA.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They've
controlled remote viewing

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:90%
for a number of years.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, this new technique
that they're using,

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.600 align:middle line:90%
again, it's highly classified.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to it
that I don't know about

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and nobody else seems to know
about except the people that

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:90%
have gone through that course.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are some people
that have spoken on Instagram

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.020 align:middle line:90%
and Twitter about it.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And some of the information is
probably true and some of it

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:90%
is probably made up.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there's a
deception operation

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.520 align:middle line:84%
out there going to
cover up the real truth.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure that's occurring.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:90%
That's occurring.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What kind
of examples can you

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
offer where these skills were
actually used during a mission?

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Most of what I heard--

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is coming
from a source of information

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:90%
that have access to it.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Most of the operations
on a one-on-one

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
dealt with wartime, either
in Iraq or in Afghanistan,

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.610 align:middle line:84%
looking for prisoners
of war, trying

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:84%
to locate high
catches of ammunition

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:84%
in certain locations in
Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Most of those operations
dealt with wartime information

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:58.100 align:middle line:84%
or wartime intelligence that
we needed to track something.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it also used to
receive and send information?

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: When I asked
that particular question,

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.670 align:middle line:84%
the ex-experiencer
wouldn't answer it.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:09.145 align:middle line:84%
So that means probably
yes, it can go both ways,

00:16:09.145 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:90%
sending and receiving.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you were
involved with sitting next

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:90%
to an experiencer?

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.790 align:middle line:90%
He talked, not in any details.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:25.340 align:middle line:84%
He talked about general
nature of the program,

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:84%
but he refused to answer
a lot of questions.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But there was other
people or other ways

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.765 align:middle line:84%
that we found other
information that leaked out.

00:16:32.765 --> 00:16:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, I see.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There's an article
in a UK newspaper about TPA

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:90%
some years ago.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:90%
And although I don't think--

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't think all
of it was accurate,

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.160 align:middle line:90%
but I think a lot of it was.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And there was a source
of information that--

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:56.830 align:middle line:84%
apparently the team went
from 2010 or '11 time frame.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Some team members' trainers went
to the MI-5, which is the FBI,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.160 align:middle line:90%
and trained some of them.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And that leaked out in the
UK press some years ago,

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I think 2014 or
sometime like that.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.452 align:middle line:84%
And you can still
find that article.

00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:17.160 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
information on there

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that this particular person we
know says, that's not accurate.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: [LAUGHS]

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's not accurate.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But how you
know you can trust it.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.258 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, you know.

00:17:25.258 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:90%
What, is it disinformation?

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, a lot of it is,
and a lot of it's not.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Once that
information is acquired,

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Richard, how does
it get applied?

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Wow, that's a--

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I guess it's different
between each mission, right?

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Right.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:84%
It depends on-- it's
mission-dependent.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.830 align:middle line:90%
You know, you have a mission.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:84%
If you've got an Iraqi soldier
that you want to interrogate

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking for an
arms cache in some location

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:84%
or an improvised
explosive device

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.510 align:middle line:84%
or where they're making
them, that's mission-direct.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's exactly what--

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That would make sense.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.105 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --the only
thing that you

00:18:03.105 --> 00:18:05.890 align:middle line:84%
want to get from that,
that interrogation,

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:90%
that mind-on-mind interrogation.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.397 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
cases where you now

00:18:10.397 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:84%
want to project
something in your mind

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.190 align:middle line:84%
to a location where you think
it might be in Afghanistan.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
You were sitting in a
facility at Bolling Air Force

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Base, a control
facility, and now you're

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
almost like remote viewing,
but it's a different technique

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:84%
to put your mind inside
the tunnel or that cave

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
in the mountain in
Bora Bora, Afghanistan,

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking to see if
you can find any explosives

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:90%
or weapons or ammunition.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How does that
compare to remote viewing

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:90%
as far as accuracy?

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, remote
viewing is about 60%,

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.960 align:middle line:84%
the DIA's final report
says, and there's

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:90%
some cases where it's 90%.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle line:84%
It's never 100%, OK?
because there's so

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:57.270 align:middle line:84%
many factors that distorts the
remote viewer's perception.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this particular
technique, thought projection

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:84%
acquisition, again,
I told you there's

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:84%
ways to totally wipe other
thoughts out of their mind.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:90%
So that makes it more accurate.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
looking at 70% to 80%,

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and actually some of the
tests they did back in 2007

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:90%
showed it to be about 99%.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They never say
100% because there's always

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.210 align:middle line:90%
factors that play into it.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But when they find a soccer ball
with names written on it hidden

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
in a church steeple
in Bucharest, Romania,

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and he's sitting in
a test facility--

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:84%
it was a male experiencer
at Bolling Air Force Base--

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.440 align:middle line:84%
he read every one of those
names except for one,

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and the only one
he couldn't see was

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.690 align:middle line:90%
the one the ball's sitting on--

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, wow.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.173 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --that's about 99%.

00:19:49.173 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's interesting.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, I teach remote
viewing, and I've

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:84%
been a remote viewer
my whole life.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a thing I want to talk
about with percentages you just

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:90%
mentioned.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, with
remote viewing, if we

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:84%
have three remote viewers
that do get the same hit,

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:90%
it's over 110% accurate.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Is that also with
TPA experiencers,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:84%
like if they use
multiple experiencers

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and they all three read, is
there a percentage change?

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:20.355 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: This is where it becomes
really, really interesting.

00:20:20.355 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
much I should say,

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
but there's never, never
more than one experiencer.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Because one experiencer can
disrupt the thought patterns

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.740 align:middle line:90%
of the other experiencer.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's never more
than one experiencer.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow, interesting.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Good to know.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Has TPA ever been
used for ET contact?

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:90%
And if so, how?

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: As I understand, yes,
a number of cases that have

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
occurred whereby an
abductee reports something.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And now we have generalized
information about something.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So the experiencer
can go into the abductee?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The only information
I know is they've targeted,

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:84%
or they've dealt with
targets that were abductees.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.220 align:middle line:84%
There's probably other cases,
but I don't know any more

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:84%
than just using the abductees
by tapping in and trying

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.730 align:middle line:84%
to find out where
and what and exactly

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
how these extraterrestrials
are obtaining information

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:22.600 align:middle line:90%
from these abductees.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately, there's
another aspect to this,

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
is if an abductee walks in
and says, I've been abducted

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and I've had all
these experiences,

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.910 align:middle line:84%
so then this
experiencer will go in

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and thought projection
acquisition, use that procedure,

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and can find out that
that abductee is lying.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It's also a
good lie detector.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Excellent.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:84%
What about an actual
extraterrestrial, though?

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Have they actually sat across
from an extraterrestrial?

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I heard rumors, and
that was the part of it that

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.970 align:middle line:84%
was on the internet
some time ago,

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
anything firsthand.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
they actually did.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:90%
It would make sense.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But then again, you've
got to think about this.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.860 align:middle line:90%
We're dealing with human brains.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're-- all the training
that these experiencers are

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:90%
having is with human brains.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.905 align:middle line:84%
Now, how can they do this
with an extraterrestrial that

00:22:21.905 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a human brain?

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:90%
That would be a problem.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Now, what they did--

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and I read this and
I didn't believe it.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.900 align:middle line:10%
They did it on a
monkey, a chimpanzee,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:10%
I think it was, a
trained chimpanzee who

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:10%
was in a circus or something.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't know exactly.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But the rumor is that this
one experiencer did work

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:84%
with a monkey and seemed to
understand some things that

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:90%
were coming up.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.330 align:middle line:84%
But remember, that experiencer
knows the language;

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:84%
the monkey doesn't
know the language.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So that was the disruption
of the thought process,

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.590 align:middle line:90%
as I was told.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And whether that
actually happened,

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:90%
the person says it actually did.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.780 align:middle line:90%
I find that questionable myself.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But if you're dealing
with an extraterrestrial,

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:84%
their mind and brain
are different than ours.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
that it would work.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How far-reaching
is this technique,

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:90%
and can it go off planet?

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.858 align:middle line:90%
What's the distance?

00:23:22.858 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's a good question.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:84%
If they can look at something
in Bucharest, Romania,

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:32.240 align:middle line:84%
from Bolling Air Force Base
thousands of miles away,

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:84%
they could probably use
it on the Moon or Mars.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't think distance has
anything to do with it.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.387 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I don't believe so.

00:23:39.387 --> 00:23:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, because you
can visualize the Mars.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
You can visualize the
Moon or Europa or Titan

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:84%
or any of those moons of
Jupiter or Saturn or even Pluto.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I
mean, remote viewers,

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.010 align:middle line:84%
even way back in the day,
were able to do this.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure with
this new technique,

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:84%
there's no time and
space with this.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:84%
This is just you're there
immediately, somehow.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are the
origins of this program?

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Where did it all start?

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, it loosely is
connected to remote viewing.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Because that's
what we-- the only thing we

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:84%
had from about '75 or
'76 after the process was

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.700 align:middle line:90%
finalized in 1974.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And they used it, and they
were happy with most of it.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
scientists within DIA

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that knew there was
something else out there.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And they visualized a
number of different things.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the more that
our technology advanced,

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
the more that we
understand the human brain,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.600 align:middle line:84%
the more we realized there's a
lot of things that we can do.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And that particular MIT and
the Johns Hopkins University

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.120 align:middle line:84%
neurologist that sees that
the brain patterns are now--

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Mapping;
mapping the brain.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Mapping the brain,
they realized there's

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:90%
something else out there.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it evolved from.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Although, as I was told,
thought projection acquisition

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:84%
is not the same
as remote viewing.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: No, that's
definitely different.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The TPA is
entirely different.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:84%
It works on
different techniques.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:84%
But you could probably say
it's a psychic ability,

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's trained
psychic ability.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:90%
It's something that's trained.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I understand, the first
class went through a particular

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:84%
type of training, and
now as it advanced,

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.640 align:middle line:84%
the training has advanced
because you-- of course,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:90%
you learned something--

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right--

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --from the beginning.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --this
was many years ago.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean, that's
just so far advanced.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Our knowledge of the brain, our
knowledge of psychic research

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:90%
has advanced.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you're
training somebody to do,

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.930 align:middle line:90%
you learn from the mistakes.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Say, the early days of Navy
SEAL training up to right now,

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.230 align:middle line:84%
that's advanced so much
drastically over the years.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And this from the early
days of remote viewing

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.150 align:middle line:84%
until now, they've
advanced that to the point

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.530 align:middle line:84%
where they almost
perfected the technique.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.375 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm sure they actually
have so much funding now.

00:26:10.375 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Every year, they probably
get more and more funding

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.060 align:middle line:84%
to map the brain
and do more testing

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.430 align:middle line:90%
and to make it so specific.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's a lot of money
that's pumped into this program,

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's
bringing back results.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:29.420 align:middle line:84%
If you can project
something into someplace

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:84%
like North Korea, someplace that
we probably can't get spies in

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
as easily as we could
in other countries,

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and we need to find out exactly
what the leader of North Korea

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.120 align:middle line:84%
is making in that
particular bunker, what kind

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.150 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear weapon it is, what's
the yield of that weapon and all

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:84%
these things, these
people can sit back

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:84%
at Bolling Air Force
Base and do that

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:90%
without sending a spy in there.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they using
TPA to mind control people,

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.842 align:middle line:90%
put thoughts in their brain?

00:26:58.842 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It's a good question.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I think they are, but
that's only my belief.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
I think if you're doing
a brain-to-brain transfer

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:84%
of a target and you're
one-on-one with them,

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.680 align:middle line:84%
if they can put
something into your mind,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.250 align:middle line:84%
then they can plant something
in there that stays in there.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen
anything like that.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:90%
I haven't read anything.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's told me that.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:90%
But that's a good idea.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's an idea
that I thought about too,

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:34.030 align:middle line:84%
is if they could use that to
get something out of that,

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.190 align:middle line:84%
they could plant something
in that person's brain

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.080 align:middle line:90%
that will stay there.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Something similar to a
Manchurian candidate.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:43.402 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:43.402 --> 00:27:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Are they using this
technique to maybe operate

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.180 align:middle line:90%
ET craft to get the interface?

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: What I heard--

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I
heard, and I don't

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.620 align:middle line:84%
know that this is classified,
but I don't think it is.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:84%
I never read a document that
said "top secret" on it.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I've been told by somebody that
they have used that technique.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.740 align:middle line:90%
But what they do is they--

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.900 align:middle line:84%
they're dealing with
an extraterrestrial,

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and they let that
extraterrestrial plant things

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.600 align:middle line:90%
in that experiencer's mind.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:84%
They tried this technique,
and it's more of a one way

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.040 align:middle line:84%
that they get stuff back, rather
than they actually get something

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:90%
from the extraterrestrial.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And then they went out and
tried to examine something,

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:33.080 align:middle line:84%
an artifact or a technology that
non-human intelligence gave us,

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.860 align:middle line:90%
or we found at a crash site.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And now, based on what that
ET gave that experiencer,

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.720 align:middle line:84%
maybe they can understand
how it operates.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the only information
I have ever heard.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you ever heard
about these organic craft that

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.180 align:middle line:84%
are conscious, and
this technique used

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.020 align:middle line:84%
on just the craft, not
the extraterrestrial?

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I know about
those crafts where

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
the entire structure
of the craft

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:84%
is a living organism; the outer
shell, the materials inside,

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.470 align:middle line:84%
everything is blended into
that extraterrestrial.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:90%
I've heard that.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.400 align:middle line:90%
But I haven't connect--

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard where they
connected TPA with that.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is the future
of advanced psychic research?

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Where is it going
in the military?

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, if we went
from remote viewing to TPA,

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's something
else out there that they're

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
experimenting with right now,
that we don't know about,

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:90%
that's highly classified.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it's never ending,
the advancement of technology

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:38.130 align:middle line:84%
within DARPA, within
the government programs.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure right
now, today, they're

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.530 align:middle line:84%
