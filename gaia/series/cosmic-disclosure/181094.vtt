[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:21.060 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hello, everybody.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:10%
Jay Weidner here, and we're
continuing our conversation

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:10%
with Jason Rice.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON RICE: Hi, Jay.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.118 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So today
we're going to talk

00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:31.670 align:middle line:84%
to you about the big
lie, the big deception

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:90%
that you went through.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: The big lie, the
things they lied to me about,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:10%
started from day one.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:84%
It started from my early times
at Cape Canaveral Air Station.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.005 align:middle line:90%
The lies started even then.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Because
you can't remember

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.572 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what happened
there, as you told us before.

00:00:47.572 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you served there for
what, a couple of years, right?

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The total time
working at the Cape

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.990 align:middle line:90%
was a couple of years.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's strange.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah, very strange.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They created
kind of almost a theater

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
that you were involved in,
like a play or a movie that you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.790 align:middle line:90%
were participating in.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to have a
goal, an endgame, as it were.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:84%
But you were always kind of
kept in the dark about it, which

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:90%
was also part of the plan.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So what was the ultimate
endgame, do you think,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:90%
of your training?

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think the ultimate
endgame of my training

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:84%
was to put us on boots on
the ground on another planet

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:84%
to help further their cause
in enslaving and controlling

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:84%
other planets
aside from the ones

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:90%
that they started where we were.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And why would they
want to enslave planets?

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.592 align:middle line:90%
Why not just leave them be?

00:01:46.592 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Why not just let
them go to their own devices

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:90%
and develop in their own way?

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
alien psychology is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.150 align:middle line:84%
that we may never
fully understand

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
why they're driven
to do these things,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.970 align:middle line:84%
or why the AI is so set on
the disposal or disruption

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
of biological and sentient
life, or the control

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:90%
and takeover of it.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:84%
We can only fathom or grasp
at understanding, I believe,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:90%
why they would want to do that.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And from our human condition
and our own experiences

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and background, we can
come up with lots of words

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.500 align:middle line:90%
to try and explain it.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that it
is an alien thought process

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.310 align:middle line:84%
that we may not ever
fully understand

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
until we have reached maybe
higher consciousness or higher

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: We know that the
so-called modern day

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Cabal of bankers
and industrialists

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
really started in
the 1700s in Germany.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Frankfurt, probably, was
the place where it started.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And what you're saying
is that this same Cabal

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:84%
is the force behind this
colonization program going on

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:84%
in outer space, in the
Secret Space Program.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, they
are a part of it.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.590 align:middle line:84%
But the ultimate strings
and the ultimate control,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate decision
making, is being done

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:90%
at levels way above their head.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So that this thing
is a new development

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:84%
that the aliens have
kind of pushed us into.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
They've put us right center
stage of being involved in it.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Again, why would they want
to kill off their people

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.460 align:middle line:84%
when they've got proxies more
than willing to do it for them?

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the Cabal is using human
proxies for these alien forces.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Are they a
homogeneous group

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.480 align:middle line:84%
of aliens or a single
group of aliens?

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They are a consortium.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
They're our allies
amongst the Draco.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the Draco.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:90%
They do have allies.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:84%
There are beings that align more
with their lines of thinking

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:84%
or their way of thinking
than they would with us.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:90%
So they have groups.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
They involve them in
and where they need to.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
I suppose if you asked
who was the leading

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:84%
partner in that partnership,
depending on who you ask,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:84%
you'd probably get
different answers.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.072 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Are there alien groups
that are against the Draco

00:04:27.072 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:90%
and what they're doing?

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: There are.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.650 align:middle line:84%
They are some of the more
benign, more benevolent

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
alien ETs that have been talked
about on Earth or visited Earth

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:84%
or helped Earth
humans in the past.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What about the aliens
that live underground?

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Are they for the Draco,
against the Draco?

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think you have
a mixture of those that

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
are with them and
the mixture of those

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:90%
that are against them as well.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The underground
aliens, why

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:84%
were they so reticent
until recently?

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, it wasn't
time, for several reasons.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.000 align:middle line:84%
The timing of the event
has approached and gotten

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:90%
a lot closer.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And so along with the human
consciousness, the surface

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:84%
population involvement, as well
as where we're at as a species,

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:84%
the awakenings that
have happened since 2012

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:84%
have gone exponential
over the past six years.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So that has played a
major part in it, too.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I think if we had not
experienced or seen

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:84%
an awakening on the
surface population,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
that they may not
have gotten involved

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:90%
as much as they are now.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So our waking
up is alerting them

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.130 align:middle line:90%
that it's time for them to move.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Correct.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And this waking up,
is this a pro-Cabal waking up

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:90%
or an anti-Cabal waking up?

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think it is an
anti-slavery movement,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:05.230 align:middle line:84%
an anti-control,
anti-separation, anti-duality

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:90%
movement is what we're seeing.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:84%
All of us as a human
race, the Earth humans,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
have to be aware of
what was going on.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And after we're able
to make that correction

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and stop some of the more evil
and vile things from happening,

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:84%
stop killing each other,
stop lying to each other,

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to move on to the
love and forgiveness,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
then we can correct the things
that we've done elsewhere.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.647 align:middle line:84%
We've got to clean up
our own house first.

00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And that is
part of disclosure.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.688 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That is
part of disclosure.

00:06:39.688 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Facing up to what has
really been going on here.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:90%
And one little bit at a time.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:84%
If all of the disclosure
happened at one time,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.200 align:middle line:84%
you'd end up with a large
portion of the population that

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:90%
would automatically reject it.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
it's played out--

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and originally I thought,
you know, gosh, let's

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:90%
hear it all right now.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked
about this before.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:84%
My own personal journey is I
wanted to have all the memories

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.260 align:middle line:90%
all at one time.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: There is an ancient text
called the "Emerald Tablet"

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
which was supposedly
written by Thoth,

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:84%
who is the great scientist
magician from ancient Egypt.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I want to read you a
little part from it.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:84%
"In the form of man
they walk amongst us,

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:84%
but only to cite
where they are men.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Serpent-headed when
the glamour was lifted,

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.970 align:middle line:84%
slaying by their arts, the
chiefs of the kingdoms,

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:84%
taking their form
and ruling over man.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Only by magic could
they be discovered.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Only by sound could
their faces be seen.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Sought they from the kingdom
of shadows to destroy man

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.067 align:middle line:90%
and rule in his place."

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Wow.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:90%
That's powerful.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.640 align:middle line:84%
That is a very apt
description of the Draco

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and their methodologies
that they've

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.042 align:middle line:84%
used for taking over those
that are in places of power.

00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And essentially
the quote is

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.830 align:middle line:84%
saying that the people in
power are secretly Dracos.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's exactly
what that's saying.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Says only by magic
can they be discovered.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Only by sound can
their faces be seen.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So there is something
that we can do magically

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.180 align:middle line:90%
to see them and discover them.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever come across
anything like that?

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Etherically
and spiritually,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
being able to expose
them, and the use of sound

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and the study of particular
frequencies on matter

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
and its organizing into
particular geometric shapes.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:84%
We used a lot of different
ways for military purposes

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.870 align:middle line:84%
that included everything
from location, sonar.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is referring to
using some type of energy

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:84%
in order to remove some of
the disguises that they have.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: So we know
from Hans Jenny's work

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.970 align:middle line:10%
that he would vibrate dust
and use different frequencies,

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:05.690 align:middle line:10%
and it would create
different forms.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.070 align:middle line:10%
So if they're using some
kind of material form

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:10%
to reshape their faces
into looking like a human,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.280 align:middle line:10%
then there would be
possibly some kind of weapon

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:10%
or a chant that would
reform it, and we'd

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.840 align:middle line:10%
see what they
really looked like.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.240 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, some of the
replicator technologies

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
that we used-- utilized, so
ultrasonic, high frequency

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:84%
sounds for the arrangement
at the atomic level

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
of particular atoms
for the replicators.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I don't think you've
mentioned replicators at all

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:90%
in your discussions here.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:90%
What's a replicator?

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The replicators, like
we used my first experience

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:84%
with them, was for
food in the cafeteria

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:84%
in which they had
created the meals that we

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.550 align:middle line:90%
had at breakfast time.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And so creating what appeared to
be an empty shelf, and from it,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:84%
at the push of a button,
came the dinners that we ate

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:90%
or the meals that we enjoyed.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.415 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So food would
appear already cooked

00:10:11.415 --> 00:10:12.290 align:middle line:90%
and ready on a plate.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It would be cooked
hot, perfect every single time.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
The replicator technology,
through the use of waves,

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:90%
ultrasound, ultrasonic signals--

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not familiar with the
exact math on how it was done.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell
you my experiences

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:84%
with them is that
I heard sounds,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel a wave
or a field close to it.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:84%
You didn't put your
hand in the area

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
while things were reforming
because you didn't want it

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.997 align:middle line:90%
to reform as part of your hand.

00:10:45.997 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, you could
get close enough to it

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and you could feel that
there was an energy there.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.360 align:middle line:84%
There was a charge
in the air itself.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And you could hear a
sound that was going on.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the
recent technologies

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.520 align:middle line:84%
that they have released
and talked about openly

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
involves the use of
lasers and ultrasounds

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:84%
for examining atomic
structures, being

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:84%
able to modify molecules
and molecular structures.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And so removing those
holograms or those disguises

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:90%
through the use of sound.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Some of the US
embassy personnel that

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
had experienced the ultrasound
or the sound waves--

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Cuba Embassy

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Attacked, yes.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Recently.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.398 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That was very recent.

00:11:34.398 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were unwilling
participants in sound wave

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.590 align:middle line:90%
experiments in which--

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.732 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Some went deaf.

00:11:44.732 --> 00:11:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Some went deaf.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yes, very deadly.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.749 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And there were very
long-lasting injuries from it.

00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And we still don't
know what was going on.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They're not
publicly talking about it.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And so being able to undo
the masks, the disguises,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and being able to use sound
to good effect to do that,

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:84%
it could be a
possible side effect

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.570 align:middle line:84%
of some of these sound
weapons that we've heard

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.820 align:middle line:90%
about peripherally in the news.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So we could have
a weapon that we've

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.772 align:middle line:84%
developed right now which
could make the Draco visible.

00:12:14.772 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm absolutely
certain that we do

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:90%
have the technology right now.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.658 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do you think the
Draco are still here on Earth

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:90%
ruling us?

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I don't think
that they're here

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:84%
pulling as many strings
as they once did.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
They still have certain
manipulations and control

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.450 align:middle line:90%
over a number of Cabal members.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And that I don't know
will ever go away

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:84%
because of the karmic
connection that those Cabal

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:90%
members have with the Draco.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the energetic exchanges
that the Cabal members have

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:84%
come to expect and rely on--
and just like a drug addict,

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
they depend on it, even though
it's not healthy for them

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.696 align:middle line:90%
in any way--

00:12:58.696 --> 00:13:00.570 align:middle line:84%
is still something that
they're dependent on.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And so some of them
are never going

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.124 align:middle line:84%
to be free until the
Draco are completely gone.

00:13:08.124 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is it fair
to say that they

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:84%
may have some kind of
program that they're putting,

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:84%
on the elites, so
therefore they're

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.830 align:middle line:84%
completely slaves to the whole
idea of the Draco program?

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They're completely
slaves to the process.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.030 align:middle line:84%
They were taken advantage
of a long time ago,

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:84%
going back generations, and then
the next generation, and then

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.290 align:middle line:90%
the next generation.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, they
had no means or method

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:90%
for getting out of it.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:84%
They were trapped in it from the
time that they were conceived.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And so from the
moment they are born,

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:84%
they are part of that process
and part of that entrapment.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they may think that
their illusion of control

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:84%
is one in which
they have control,

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:84%
but they actually
don't because they

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:84%
are being controlled by the
psychological, the physical,

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual connections.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I think you're
absolutely right, Jay,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.150 align:middle line:84%
in that they're
addicted on many levels.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is the Cabal
softening up these worlds

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:90%
for Draconian rule?

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think that's just one
of the steps in the process.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And again, you have
to remember who's

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
calling the shots
to the great Draco,

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.280 align:middle line:90%
and that would be the AI.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
AI's ultimate goal?

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Is the dehumanization, the
non-biological existence,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and I imagine-- again, this
gets back to the alien thought

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
processes that we can't
possibly try and explain away--

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
but the closest that I can
come is that the AI truly

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.750 align:middle line:84%
believes that what
the AI is doing

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:90%
is the right way to do it.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of all the biological.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.908 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And replace it
with the technological.

00:14:52.908 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Technological existence.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And therefore they can bypass
all kinds of karmic issues

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:84%
or any number of
spiritual things,

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and they can continue
and perpetuate

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.720 align:middle line:84%
without that pesky
thing called death.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Which is
what they're working

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.830 align:middle line:10%
on with Ray Kurzweil at the
Google technology division.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.260 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Right.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.190 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Essentially trying to
create a transhumanist future

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:20.186 align:middle line:10%
where we are married
to a machine forever.

00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
endgame for the AI.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:90%
That is the ultimate goal.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do you think that people
like Elon Musk and Bill Gates

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and Steven Hawking, Steve
Jobs, why they're warning us

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
against AI, because their
high degree of knowledge

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:84%
in technology has given them
some kind of insight into it

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.570 align:middle line:90%
that we may not have seen?

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I believe part of the
rules that they have to play

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.020 align:middle line:90%
by because--

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't matter who
you are or where you are--

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:84%
if you go outside the
boundaries of what's

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:84%
acceptable as far as
telling the public,

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:84%
you're either locked up
into a padded room, where

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:84%
you have an accident from
a closed barred window

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:90%
or you're assassinated.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And so they have to be very
careful in what they say.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And so warning us in the
way that they have warned

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:90%
us is telling us yes.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:84%
They have probably
seen or been read

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:90%
into information about the AI.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.555 align:middle line:84%
That would be my assumption is
that they have been briefed.

00:16:24.555 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You say
you don't remember

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:84%
a lot about your
service during the time

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:84%
that you spent in
Cape Canaveral.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
you can remember

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.552 align:middle line:84%
about what happened there that
might contribute to your idea

00:16:35.552 --> 00:16:37.510 align:middle line:84%
that there is some kind
of deception happening?

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.110 align:middle line:84%
The main deceptions that
they were working on with me

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.210 align:middle line:84%
at that time were the
desensitization training

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that I was going through at
that time was to desensitize me

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:84%
to the concept or thoughts
about number one, alien races.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Getting me used to
seeing alien races.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Testing me on my intuitive
empath abilities.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Getting me to start thinking
about and utilizing those

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.490 align:middle line:84%
intuitive empath
abilities so that I

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.519 align:middle line:84%
would be prepped and ready for
entrance into the SSP program

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:11.319 align:middle line:90%
that I was in.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.819 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: The second time.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The second
time, that's correct.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And when you
say, during your session

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.160 align:middle line:84%
with hypnotherapist
Georgina Cannon,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:84%
that there were these lies,
what were you referring to then?

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Because you looked kind
of startled, frankly.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was recalling
a whole host of lies

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.810 align:middle line:90%
that I'd been told.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the emotional
aspect of it

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:84%
was gosh, being lied to
for more than 20 years.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is that
hey, I had bought into that

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.150 align:middle line:84%
until the very
end when I started

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:84%
putting all the pieces
together and realizing what was

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:90%
starting, what was going on.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was that a process at
the end there that you yourself

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.160 align:middle line:84%
were just naturally
going through,

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:84%
or did someone help you
with telling you about what

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:90%
was really happening?

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, the
collection of information

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that I had had over
the 20-year period

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:84%
was from a number of sources,
general staff officers

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:14.109 align:middle line:84%
acting and doing things
that were 20 seconds

00:18:14.109 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:84%
before they just
said they were going

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:16.930 align:middle line:90%
to do something different.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
These were things that
just didn't make sense

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
unless you look at the
whole picture of, OK,

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.530 align:middle line:90%
what's the real purpose?

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.120 align:middle line:90%
What were we really doing?

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:90%
What was the real goal?

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Why were they trying to
bring these other planets

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:90%
into the fold?

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Why were they perpetuating this
lie that from the small of hey,

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:84%
you're underground
in the United States

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.430 align:middle line:84%
telling us that, when
actually we're off planet,

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.460 align:middle line:84%
telling us that there were
radioactive areas because

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:84%
of the nuclear power plants
that they used to power

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.144 align:middle line:90%
the underground base.

00:18:50.144 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:90%
Had nothing to do with that.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.726 align:middle line:84%
It was because
they didn't want us

00:18:52.726 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
to go outside the boundaries
of the containment for the base

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:90%
because we were off planet.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, every step of
the way there were lies.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:90%
There was deception.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And this idea that
they could script reality

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:84%
to such a degree,
what does that make

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
you think about the world around
us that we live in right now,

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:90%
the modern world?

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Is this being scripted?

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Jay, it was a
tremendous awakening for me,

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:84%
just that single aspect of
how much your everyday life--

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much control,
no illusion of control

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:90%
that you think you have--

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.640 align:middle line:84%
it can be scripted
and controlled

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:84%
right down to the color of the
shoelace that you're wearing.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And you may think
the whole time you

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:84%
have complete control over
it, whereas six months before,

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.870 align:middle line:84%
the right seed was
placed in the right time,

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and then two days
later something else.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And you're directed and
herded in the direction

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.439 align:middle line:90%
that they want.

00:19:53.439 --> 00:19:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And we're talking
about people that aren't

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:90%
in the Secret Space Program.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
regular people

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
living in the United States are
living heavily scripted lives,

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and they have this
illusion of free will.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: This illusion of
free will and control.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely correct.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was not
just the military.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:84%
But you start looking
around, and you

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:19.810 align:middle line:84%
noticing the food, the
poisons, the chemtrails,

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:84%
the types of security measures
that, for our own good,

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:90%
we have to go through.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:90%
It's so pervasive.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And waking up to
that illusion was

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:84%
such an enlightening
experience in my own life.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.400 align:middle line:90%
And that is something that--

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.050 align:middle line:90%
waking up, it's like waking up.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why they call
it the awakening

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.920 align:middle line:84%
because it's coming to realize
all the things that you

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.430 align:middle line:84%
were lied to and controlled
and manipulated about.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.730 align:middle line:90%
We do have a choice.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So we do have
free will, If we

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.140 align:middle line:84%
know enough about
our situation we

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.730 align:middle line:90%
can decide to end the illusion.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.605 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:21:01.605 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's the key, is to
know enough about the illusion

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:84%
that you can look beyond the
curtains, that you can see

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:84%
outside the stage, and that
you can do your own research,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and through your
own discernment,

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:84%
find out the information that's
out there because the problem

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:90%
is apathy.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So many people are just
accepting what they're told,

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.890 align:middle line:90%
accepting what they're reading.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now you can't even look
at a video without the chance

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:84%
that part of the video,
if not all of it, is fake.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:84%
They have the technology and
they have for a long time.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:84%
But you're starting
to see it released

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:84%
into the mainstream, which
means more people are

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:84%
going to have access to it,
not just the special access

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you say there was
more than just one alien group

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
that's behind this kind
of nefarious activities.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So we know one of
them are the Draco.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Who are the other alien groups
that are helping the Draco?

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There are other
insectoids and reptilian beings

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:90%
that are allied with the Draco.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have
to be very careful

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.670 align:middle line:84%
because not all of the
insectoids or reptilians

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:22.750 align:middle line:84%
are going to fall into line with
that negative type of being.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Just like with humans,
with Earth humans,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
there are those that
are negatively oriented

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.530 align:middle line:84%
service to self and
there are those that

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:90%
are service to others positive.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Same thing applies to
reptilians and insectoids.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:90%
We can't stereotype.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:84%
The others that help
them out, the reason

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
that we know that
they have allies

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.800 align:middle line:84%
is that number
one, their M.O. Is

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to expose themselves

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:84%
except where and when
they absolutely have to.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Are there positive ETs?

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There are positive
and benevolent ETs out

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:59.590 align:middle line:84%
there that are very interested
in the Earth human progression

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and helping us make
it to the next level

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:84%
without killing ourselves
or allowing ourselves

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:84%
to be conquered and taken
over and controlled or turned

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:90%
into machines.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.944 align:middle line:84%
Those aliens are going
to be a wide range.

00:23:12.944 --> 00:23:14.110 align:middle line:90%
They're going to look human.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:20.920 align:middle line:84%
They're going to look like
small variations of humans,

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:84%
be it a smaller bridge on
the nose to larger eyes

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:32.044 align:middle line:84%
to more closely set eyes
or further apart eyes.

00:23:32.044 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Like the
Nordics, in a way.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Exactly.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Small variations to the
human blueprint, if you will.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the Nordics
live underground on Earth?

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think that
they have bases here.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that they
have bases as well on the moon,

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.380 align:middle line:84%
along with dozens
of other races.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:84%
They have probably locations
all throughout the galaxy

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:84%
because they have
that technology.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: We know from the statues
of the humanoid reptilians come

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.980 align:middle line:84%
from Sumeria, which is
about 6,000 years ago.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So there has been evidence of
a presence of these creatures

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth for really
the whole span of history.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Were they here before that?

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: You know, there's a long
history of their involvement

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:90%
with humanity.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.810 align:middle line:84%
It goes back, as you
said, thousands of years.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And the balance between
their involvement

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:84%
with humanity and
how much involvement

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:84%
has been offset by the efforts
of benevolent ET groups.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Their involvement on
Earth goes back probably

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:50.620 align:middle line:84%
a lot further than modern
mankind's history accounts

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
for because again,
Earth was a test lab.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.970 align:middle line:84%
The Draco were not
an exception to that.

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Their involvement in the
production of sentient

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:84%
being on this planet
wasn't accepted.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:84%
They weren't left
out of that equation.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So how much were they
involved with the dinosaurs?

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Was there a more
sentient reptilian

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:84%
being here on this planet
300 million years ago?

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And how much did it
make its sentience?

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.420 align:middle line:84%
How much civilization
did it have?

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Does the chance that
they were involved

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:84%
long before any of the modern
histories have accounted for?

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I think it's
a very, very good chance

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:84%
that they were because they
weren't the only ones that

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:84%
were here tinkering that were
trying to get things going.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And my suspicion is
that they were probably

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.800 align:middle line:84%
one of the first, which
accounts for the die-off

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.470 align:middle line:84%
of the large percentage
of life on Earth

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.580 align:middle line:84%
was that there were those
intergalactically that were not

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:84%
happy with what and how they'd
set things up and done things

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And there were others that
wanted a piece of the pie,

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.650 align:middle line:84%
if you will, in being able
to run their own tests here

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:09.710 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the dinosaurs
were probably a result

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.686 align:middle line:90%
of reptilian experiments.

00:26:14.686 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I would
be willing to bet

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
that there were sentient
life here that was conscious

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:84%
as well as very intelligent,
reptilian-based, that died off

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:90%
during that same period.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the asteroid
that hit the Gulf of Mexico

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.050 align:middle line:84%
60 million years ago and
killed off the dinosaurs

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:90%
could have been a weapon?

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There is a strong
suspicion in my mind

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that it was not an accident,
and that it was part of a plan

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:84%
because of what was happening
at that time with the Draco

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and their use of genetics
and manipulations

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.664 align:middle line:90%
here on this planet.

00:26:52.664 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You saw a lot of
different alien races.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:90%
You fought against some.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.610 align:middle line:84%
You fought side
by side with some.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Where do humans stand in
the hierarchy of the aliens?

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Who's on top, who's
in the middle,

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:05.560 align:middle line:90%
and who's on the bottom?

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, I would
say that Earth humans--

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:84%
from a standpoint of
the creative ability

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and the technical
know how, and how much

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:84%
we're able to manipulate things
to make devices and creations,

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and not just the
technical side of things,

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:28.090 align:middle line:84%
but art work, creativity
and music and multiple media

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:90%
forms--

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:middle line:84%
that humans from
Earth are unique.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Humans have a
certain non-happiness

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:90%
with status quo, Earth humans.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that I noticed

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.460 align:middle line:84%
in some of the other planets
is that that same spark

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.970 align:middle line:84%
for wanting to always
change something

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.740 align:middle line:84%
is not as common as
we see here on Earth.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that, I believe,
was a genetic modification

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:84%
that was done to our
lineage a long time ago.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that, we tend to have

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:13.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot more creative ways
to express art as well as

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.670 align:middle line:90%
hurt each other, unfortunately.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:19.600 align:middle line:84%
You get the full
spectrum of creativity.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So where do Earth humans
fall in the spectrum?

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, as a
species, Earth humans,

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.010 align:middle line:84%
we are so young in
the development.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
spiritually, we

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
have to work on
developing that more.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're on a
good start to that.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
more that we need

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.680 align:middle line:84%
to work on in the ways
of our consciousness,

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:84%
our cooperative consciousness
collectively as a planet.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And we walk around
in our own worlds

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.300 align:middle line:90%
and doing our own things.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And the butterfly
effect, there's

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:84%
a reason for that
is one thing you

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
do on one side of the planet
as a person spiritually

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:84%
has an effect on what
happens everywhere else.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And so once we
realize that potential

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and are able to channel
that and direct it,

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I believe in
positive directions,

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to move out
of the kindergarten area

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that Earth humans are in and
move up and work our way up.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So maybe the Draco
were a necessary evil,

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.510 align:middle line:84%
like a stern parent
or something,

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and that now that the Draco
are leaving, we as a species

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.536 align:middle line:90%
are reaching maturation quickly.

00:29:34.536 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:36.210 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's my
personal belief

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.970 align:middle line:84%
that the creator had
a plan going back

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.630 align:middle line:84%
countless of trillions of years
ago when things were created.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And no one really
knows what the plan

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:56.200 align:middle line:84%
was, that in order for
positive to have a challenge,

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:84%
there has to be a negative,
the yin and the yang.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And so who's to say that
the AI threat isn't here

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:84%
specifically as that
challenge for the light,

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.560 align:middle line:90%
for the positive?

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sure.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.850 align:middle line:84%
We can either
choose the AI, or we

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.900 align:middle line:84%
can choose our own
internal spiritual self

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:84%
to create light bodies
and to be telepathic.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's our choice, I think,
we're being given right now.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.881 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's
absolutely right, Jay.

00:30:23.881 --> 00:30:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
apathetic, easy solution

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:31.270 align:middle line:84%
that most of society
tries to accept

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and that they are
pushing forward so hard

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:84%
is take a pill if you're sick
or what's the short cut answer,

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.650 align:middle line:84%
or how do you get to a
solution as quickly as you can?

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.850 align:middle line:84%
All of those things are
eliminating the work

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:90%
that we have to do.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Trying to get from A to
Z without passing in between.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.370 align:middle line:90%
And you can't do that.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Proper spiritual
development is hard work.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Yoga is not easy.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Meditation is not easy.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It's painful.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.180 align:middle line:90%
It's tough.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:04.090 align:middle line:84%
It requires a tremendous
amount of mental gymnastics

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.880 align:middle line:84%
to make it through
the interceding steps.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And the easy path is
not always the best.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What is the long-term
goal, in your opinion,

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.970 align:middle line:90%
of the AI?

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, the
AI long term is

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.380 align:middle line:84%
to spread and infect as
many biological living

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.210 align:middle line:90%
organisms as possible.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And through that
infection process,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:84%
you can't just go in and
infect everything all at once

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.460 align:middle line:84%
because you end up
killing the host.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:38.170 align:middle line:84%
So the laws and rules--
again, the guidelines

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that they have to play in--
is they have to be invited in.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.050 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
an unwilling host.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:47.170 align:middle line:84%
They want a host
that invites them in.

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Like vampires.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Just like vampires.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Just like the reason we
were at other planets

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:55.630 align:middle line:84%
is they were fed this
line of BS about you're

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.980 align:middle line:84%
going to be invaded
and destroyed

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.090 align:middle line:90%
unless you get our humble help.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And so they were fed that line.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And we were invited
in, and so the AI

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.250 align:middle line:90%
plays along the same book.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:13.170 align:middle line:84%
They have to be
invited in and wanted.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:84%
The whole concept of
security and people's safety,

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:24.070 align:middle line:84%
these false flags that we've
seen over the last years

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.850 align:middle line:84%
have pushed the security state
more and more and more and more

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and more because people are
suddenly afraid of their safety

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.190 align:middle line:90%
and security.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And so now we've got
unreasonable search and seizure

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.300 align:middle line:90%
at airports.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're wanting to
push unreasonable search

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and seizures before you
walk into any buildings now,

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and the proliferation of close
cam television and tech cameras

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:54.520 align:middle line:84%
everywhere to watch
over us, again,

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:84%
because people keep
asking for this,

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.830 align:middle line:84%
or because they falsely
are led to believe

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.520 align:middle line:90%
that that's what they need.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the AI follows
the same protocols.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:84%
They have to get asked in,
and then once they're in,

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:12.550 align:middle line:84%
they slowly move that line
forward more and more.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And where at first, we're
just wearing watches,

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.010 align:middle line:84%
before you know
it, within 50 years

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:21.995 align:middle line:84%
people are embedding
electronics into their skin that

00:33:21.995 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:90%
are now a part of their body.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Move that line
forward a little more.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Now you have false and fake
and mechanical and electronic

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:90%
body parts.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it,
you've got the entire body,

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:35.890 align:middle line:90%
and it's just the brain.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, why do we even

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.020 align:middle line:90%
need a biological brain?

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:44.440 align:middle line:84%
We can have these electronics
and these transhuman bodies

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.390 align:middle line:84%
that we can upload
ourselves into.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Why do we even need a body?

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the AI is
actually creating itself.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Replicating itself.

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.146 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It's an
intelligence that's

00:33:53.146 --> 00:33:56.140 align:middle line:84%
creating a vehicle that
it can use to get around.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I want to thank you,
Jason, for being with us

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:90%
today again.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And thank you
for having me, Jay.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's
all about disclosure.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.989 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure",

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.699 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:17.909 align:middle line:10%
and secret space programs.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:19.659 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: All of the
countries on the planet

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:24.790 align:middle line:84%
contribute soldiers to
this Mars German program.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The ICC is in trade with over
900 different civilizations.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:84%
>> There's thousands of
extraterrestrials were working

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:36.039 align:middle line:84%
amongst us daily in corporations
and all around the planet.
