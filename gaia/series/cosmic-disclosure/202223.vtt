00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:10%
a retired Special Agent who
served in the Air Force Office

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations and
was intimately involved with

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.470 align:middle line:10%
UFO, ET-related content.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So first of all, how did
you get involved with these

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.233 align:middle line:84%
projects that
involved ETs and UFOs?

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I investigated an incident at
Kirtland Air Force Base while I

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
was an OSI
counterintelligence officer.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And that involved a guy by
the name of Paul Benowitz

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and what he did and
what he gathered

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:90%
regarding UFOs and ET contacts.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And that got me briefed
into a special program.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And that special program
carried me through my career

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.390 align:middle line:90%
as an OSI agent.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>> And tell me about--

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the 1980s, you were
stationed at Area 51, correct?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>> And what was going on there?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I was on temporary duty
assignments to Area 51.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Back then, it was called
Detachment 3 Air Force Test

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Evaluation Center.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:84%
There was three
different attachments,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Hume Lake being one,
and the most secretive.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I was a counter-intelligence
officer for the base.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
There were four other OSI
agents assigned there.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And each agent had
a compartmented job

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:90%
to do within Area 51.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> What was your job
as-- your position there?

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Mine was to safeguard
special projects.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The special projects ETs,
not only ET creatures,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.680 align:middle line:90%
but ET technology.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you keeping that
also just in the Air Force?

00:01:51.072 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Were you keeping it
from the politicians?

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Were you keeping it from
other three-letter agencies?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Or were they kind of
involved with that?

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There were some projects
that we were working on that

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:84%
involved CIA, DIA,
and mostly, DARPA.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:84%
But we did keep secrets
from government politicians.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what can you tell us
about some of the ETs there

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that-- or the extraterrestrial
beings that you had contact

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:90%
with?

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a project
there called Amber Sun,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Project Amber Sun.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Highly-classified
project that dealt

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.010 align:middle line:84%
with examining and
researching extraterrestrials

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
that the government had
captured or found in the desert

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:90%
or at crash sites.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And that project, I was
involved with that project.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you on these
retrieval teams too?

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I was on one retrieval team.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But that's actually-- it wasn't
a retrieval team so much as it

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.625 align:middle line:90%
was a--

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:84%
one of the creatures
escaped from the complex

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:90%
at Papoose Lake.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
It was called Site
5, Papoose Site 5.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:10%
Alpha Site, they called it.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.095 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they
kept the creatures.

00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:84%
There were a number
of creatures there.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I was never briefed on the
exact number of creatures.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
But the one that escaped,
I was involved with.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.700 align:middle line:84%
I was on a search
team trying to find

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:90%
this creature that escaped.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of creature was it?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what it looked
like or where it came from?

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I know it came from someplace
10 light years away from Earth.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I was briefed into
that part of it.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I was shown a picture
of the creature.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite a
hideous looking creature.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:90%
It had a very large head.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Had a body that looked
like a praying mantis.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Are these the
trantaloids you speak of?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, trantaloids.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:90%
And this creature had no teeth.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:90%
It had a mouth.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.070 align:middle line:84%
It had two slots for nose,
two openings for ears.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And it had gill-like
glands on its face

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:84%
where it would suck
in air, our air.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:90%
So it could breathe Earth air.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But the most amazing
thing about this creature

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:90%
was it didn't require food.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.640 align:middle line:84%
It manufactured its own
nourishment within its bodies.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:84%
It had two sacks on
each of its hips.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And it would produce
from internal organs

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:90%
these golf-ball-size nodules.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And they would be
inside the sacks.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
When the creature
required nourishment,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:84%
it would reach in
and take a ball out

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
of this nourishment
and place in its mouth.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the only nourishment
that these creatures needed.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:90%
It did drink water.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
But there was no other
food that it ate.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I've have had some experience
with beings like this.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And we call it chemogenesis.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's life from chemicals
that they produce themselves.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have to
have food like we do

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and extract minerals
and vitamins from it.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.150 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's exactly what
this was, they found out later.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And so this creature-- it also
had-- it was reverse jointed.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.170 align:middle line:90%
The knees were behind the legs.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:84%
It could maneuver in a number of
different types of mannerisms.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:84%
It also had this
strange cape that

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.320 align:middle line:90%
was tucked up behind its head.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And when it got scared,
or when it wanted to hide,

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
it would pull this
cape over its body,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.720 align:middle line:84%
totally enclosing its
body in this cape.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this a separate
garment from the body?

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Or is it part of the body?

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's part of the body.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:84%
It was an appendage
from the body that

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:90%
was curled up behind its head.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Not quite sure how it worked.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But when it became
scared or excited,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
it would pull it over its
head and encapsulate its body.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:84%
The creature had
claw-like hands.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:90%
And it--

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>> What color was it?

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It was dark-gray colored.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.570 align:middle line:84%
It had large eyes with
several different lids.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:84%
The texture of its
body could change.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:84%
In winter time or cold
weather, the body would harden,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.700 align:middle line:84%
the skin, the texture of
the skin, i would call it.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.790 align:middle line:90%
It would harden.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.320 align:middle line:84%
In the summertime,
it would lighten.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it like an exoskeleton
like we see on regular beetles

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.797 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:06:14.797 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not sure if--

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
no, I think that the
skeleton was internal.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Like, the skin,
was it a hard skin?

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:90%
Or did it look palpable?

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>> No, no, it was hard
skin, very hard skin.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And what did
the feet look like?

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Claw-type feet, a web--

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:34.080 align:middle line:90%
it was clawed-- three claws.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But there were webs
between each claw.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>> How tall was this being?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>> About 6 foot.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think it weighed?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It probably weighed
190, 200 pounds.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:90%
It was very dense.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Very dense looking.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Very dense.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>> What about the eyes?

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>> They were large eyes.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Large.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Very large eyes.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It had a large pupil
and had various lids.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I think there was
six different lids

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:90%
it could utilize in its eyes.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you see it
walk, or run, or jump?

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I saw it run.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see it walk.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:84%
They captured it about 80
miles North of Groom Lake

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:84%
in an area called Silver Bow,
Nevada, near Reveille Mill

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Road.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:84%
It was detained, ironically, by
a Nye County Sheriff's deputy

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:90%
and a Nevada game warden.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.260 align:middle line:84%
There was also a civilian
involved in its capture.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:84%
He actually trapped the
creature with a animal trap.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it was
kind of like a bear trap

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of animal trap.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And they held it until
the US military search

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.570 align:middle line:84%
team and military police got
there where they could take it

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:90%
into custody.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, I've been in
some of these facilities,

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
not the ones that
you're talking about.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:84%
The security on these
things are amazing.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a flea can't
get out of there.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.860 align:middle line:90%
How did he get out of there?

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>> He manipulated
the security system.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, he turned
the electricity off.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
fully understood it then.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they do now.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to manage
to get in a crawl space.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.800 align:middle line:84%
He had a radio transmitter on
him that he couldn't get off.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think, looking
at it, the experts

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:84%
said he didn't know what
that radio transmitter was,

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.390 align:middle line:84%
even though he could
manipulate electricity.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:84%
He got out of that
through a vent.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.980 align:middle line:90%
And he was able to get out.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was gone for a
good, probably, 40 minutes,

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:84%
45 minutes, I believe
it was reported,

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:84%
before they realized
he was gone.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
And then they immediately
started searching.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:42.549 align:middle line:84%
The US military police and
the Project Search team,

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:84%
the Project Amber
Sun search team--

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:84%
they had a special team
that had special equipment

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:90%
to track these things.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, he was the one that
was the non-hostile one.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
There were others there that
were very hostile that they

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:90%
kept in different type of--

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Containment means, yeah.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, contaiment, that,
if they tried to get out,

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
they were either electrocuted
or they were killed in some way.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Because he was so cooperative.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
The one thing about
it I learned is

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.332 align:middle line:84%
that he wouldn't communicate or
couldn't communicate with us.

00:09:13.332 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:90%
He just didn't-- he wouldn't.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:90%
He either refused or--

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they tried.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
You figure, from
1967 into the '80s,

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.745 align:middle line:84%
they tried for years trying to
communicate with this creature.

00:09:23.745 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't
communicate with him.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:90%
Either he just didn't want to.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Or they just couldn't--

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't get to him.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was a civilian
that was at the site

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:90%
when this happened.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Whatever happened to him?

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>> His name was Gus Wainwright.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Gus was a trapper.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:90%
He was a guide, hunting guide.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:84%
He lived up in the mountains
of the Kawich area of Nevada

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.940 align:middle line:90%
near Warm Springs.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:84%
He had worked in
the mines for years.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:90%
He was out scouting for animal--

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:84%
for a hunt-- and I believe
it was a elk hunt--

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:90%
when he saw the creature.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:90%
And he was by himself.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
He tracked that
creature by himself

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
for about a day, maybe
a little over a day.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:90%
He said 36 straight hours.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But I think, later, we found
out it was a little bit less

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.195 align:middle line:90%
And he'd set up traps for it.

00:10:21.195 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know what it was.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:84%
He had no idea what
this creature was.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.060 align:middle line:84%
He thought it was
a mutant animal

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:84%
from all the nuclear tests that
were occurring in Nevada test

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.510 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:84%
He was convinced that
this must have been

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:90%
some kind of a mutant creature.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But he actually was the
one that trapped it.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And when he trapped
it, he took pictures.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:90%
He took a picture.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And he got two other
people to come down.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Because he was going to
try to take this thing

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.355 align:middle line:90%
someplace to maybe sell it.

00:10:50.355 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, a Nye
County Sheriff's deputy

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:90%
showed up.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.010 align:middle line:84%
They were notified of
the base that there

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.920 align:middle line:84%
had been an escaped military
person that was going AWOL--

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>> A deserter.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the Nye
County Sheriff,

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and I believe a Nevada
Highway patrolman,

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.280 align:middle line:90%
were searching in that area.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:84%
The Nye County
Sheriff's deputy--

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.580 align:middle line:90%
his last name was Watson.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And he, of course,
has since died.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:90%
But he showed up.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.620 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at the creature.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And he took a picture
of the creature.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And he asked us, where'd
you get this thing from?

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Where'd it come from?

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Gus says, I don't know, I
saw it running around here.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:90%
So I trapped it.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's cuddled
up in this cape.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:84%
But Gus says, I don't think
it's-- it's not anything

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen before.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So then the sheriff
called the game warden,

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:84%
figuring, well, the game
warden would know what this

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.625 align:middle line:90%
was, some kind of creature.

00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, the game warden got
there, and looked at, and said,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what this was.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So, well, when the
military showed up--

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:84%
the Nye County Sheriffs
called the military.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
The military got there,
took him into custody.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
The military debriefed
both the Sheriff's deputy--

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
the Sheriff's deputy readily
turned over his film.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:90%
It was a 35-millimeter camera.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.200 align:middle line:90%
He turned over the camera.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Gus was a little more
reluctant to turn it over.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Now, Gus was a civilian.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And the military police had
no jurisdiction over him.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
But the Nye County
Sheriff's deputy

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
convinced Gus, you
better turn it over.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the federal agents
going to come and get

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:90%
it, one way or another.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:90%
So he did.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't turn
over all of it.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:90%
He kept one.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And that picture was at the
Warm Spring Bar and Grill

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:84%
on the wall, Warm
Springs Bar and Grill,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.060 align:middle line:84%
right up until the day that bar
and grill closed in the early--

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
it would probably be in
the middle middle '80s.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But Gus told this story
a number of times.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.570 align:middle line:90%
He told it to television people.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:90%
He's been on some specials.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I think George Knapp
interviewed him once.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But he had a story
that nobody believed.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the picture that
he posted on the wall

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.600 align:middle line:84%
at the Warm Springs Bar and
Grill, somebody else took it.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
So he could never go
back and get that.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
at some time, Gus died.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:13.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>> He probably didn't have
copies of it back then.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.378 align:middle line:84%
>> He didn't have
copies of it back then.

00:13:17.378 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So that was the
story of Gus Wainwright.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.270 align:middle line:90%
He was a character.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And I actually interviewed
Gus at the Warm Springs Bar

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.580 align:middle line:90%
and Grill.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed him for
something entirely different,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.590 align:middle line:84%
which is something
else that occurred up

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:84%
in that area, an
alleged alien abduction.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>> What did you think
of his character?

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.527 align:middle line:90%
He seemed very honest?

00:13:40.527 --> 00:13:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> He was a very
outgoing, honest person,

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:90%
very articulate person.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.820 align:middle line:84%
You could believe
him up to a point.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:84%
What he would do is
he'd tell you a story.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd exaggerate
beyond belief.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.280 align:middle line:84%
He told us that this
creature had two ray guns.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And the creature didn't
have any ray guns.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
He said he was shooting
ray guns at me.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And I had to
maneuver all around.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I was
back in in Korea--

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.770 align:middle line:84%
because he was a
Korean War veteran.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.872 align:middle line:90%
But none of that happened.

00:14:11.872 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:84%
The creature didn't have
any-- so that made him

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.270 align:middle line:90%
not believable to other people.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.482 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of people
just listened to him,

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and listened to Gus's
story, and blew it off.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And the ironic thing
about this creature

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.830 align:middle line:84%
was, if you shot or
killed this creature,

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:84%
it would immediately
deteriorate.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And dangerous fumes would
excrete from the body

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.410 align:middle line:90%
that would kill a human.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So what they had to do, if
they were going to kill it,

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:84%
they had to
immediately embalm it

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.340 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of neutralization
process, which they had.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:84%
But this particular
creature, they

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:90%
were able to capture it alive.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:90%
I saw it.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:90%
I saw them capture it.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.680 align:middle line:90%
They put it in a net.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.150 align:middle line:90%
The creature never fought back.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:90%
It was not hostile.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it injured or bleeding?

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.147 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it wasn't
injured at any point.

00:15:02.147 --> 00:15:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It was just caught in a trap?

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It was caught in a trap.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It made some horrible
sounds, screeching sounds.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, it was either scared
or maybe hurting from something

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:84%
that the County Sheriff and the
and Game and Fish officer did.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But but when we got
there, the creature

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.830 align:middle line:84%
was cooperative,
fully cooperative,

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.462 align:middle line:90%
which really surprised me.

00:15:27.462 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed at looking
at this creature.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:90%
And I was 10 feet away from it.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:90%
He never tried to do--

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.660 align:middle line:90%
it never tried to do.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it
was female or male.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.110 align:middle line:90%
But it never tried to escape.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Once it realized it was
captured, what it did do,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:84%
it was, lifted that
cape over its head,

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and either trying
to hide itself,

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:84%
or that's what they did
when they were scared.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So Rick, where did the
ET come from, number one?

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Was it, you know, an
escapee from the base?

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It was an escapee
from the base.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:84%
The creature was captured
in a crash that occurred

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:90%
near Fallen, Nevada, in 1967.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So they had that
creature for a long time.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:84%
There were actually
three creatures

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:90%
that were in the crash site.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:90%
One died in the crash.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they realized,
when they got there and found

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.700 align:middle line:84%
a craft, that this
thing exposed the rescue

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:84%
crew to toxic chemicals, which
killed some of the recovery

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:90%
team.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So they had to figure
out how to neutralize it.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:84%
The second one was captured,
taken back with the third one.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:90%
The second one escaped.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
But that was not
during my watch.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure when
that one escaped.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
It was shot and killed up near
the same area that this first--

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:90%
that this last one was.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's, again, one of--

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:84%
actually, if you go
back and research,

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:57.820 align:middle line:84%
there was a Nevada Game and
Fish officer died in that area.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.160 align:middle line:90%
They said he died of exposure.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality, he
died of coming in contact

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.069 align:middle line:84%
with this creature and
the toxic chemicals that

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:84%
were being exposed from
its deteriorating body.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The third one is the one
I'm talking about today.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.680 align:middle line:84%
It was kept at a location
near Papoose Lake, which

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:90%
was Southwest of Groom Lake.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:10%
Papoose Lake, dried
lake bed, you probably

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:30.100 align:middle line:10%
heard about Papoose Lake
from Bob Lazar, S2 Complex,

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:10%
but a little bit northwest
of that S2 complex

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:10%
was the Site Alpha.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:90%
They call it Site Alpha.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.870 align:middle line:84%
That was a enclosed,
underground facility

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:90%
that housed these captured ETs.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of the
craft that it came in?

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever get to see
or did they brief you

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:90%
on the type of craft?

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the craft
was a large craft.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:84%
It was about 45
feet in diameter.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:84%
It had landing gears or
struts that came down

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:90%
where it sat on when it landed.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, the pictures I
saw of it was when it crashed.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:84%
The front end of it was
damaged during the crash.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just looking at
pictures of the crash site.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I never saw it, actually,
the craft itself.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And it had some openings
similar to windows,

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:84%
small openings around the
separation between the top

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:90%
and the bottom of the craft.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Disk-shaped?

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of a oval saucer-shaped,
if you can look at it in that--

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:34.210 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't conventionally
round, like a saucer.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:84%
But it was some eye with
that oval shape to the back.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The craft, at
some point in time,

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:84%
they determined the
craft to be highly toxic.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
It was emitting either
some kind of a radiation,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:90%
whether it was--

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of toxic material
that we didn't understand that

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:90%
was killing people.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So what they did
was a transported

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
that craft to a location
north of Warm Springs, Nevada.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.880 align:middle line:90%
They dug a big hole.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:90%
They buried that craft.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And they sent off a nuclear
detonation of, I think,

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.012 align:middle line:84%
about 100 kiloton detonation
to destroy that craft .

00:19:14.012 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
If you read it-- you can go
back and read about this.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can
go to that site.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>> You can still see the crater.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:84%
DOE has a facility
there that they still

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:90%
maintain and safeguard.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't there a plaque there?

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a plaque there
that announces that this was

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.805 align:middle line:90%
a seismic exploration.

00:19:31.805 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
The detonation was for a
seismic experimental research.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.515 align:middle line:84%
And it happened, I believe,
in January of 1968.

00:19:39.515 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great cover-up.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>> This was some about eight
months or seven months after

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:90%
the craft crashed.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And why are these craft
crashing in these areas?

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And what are we doing with
these extraterrestrials?

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the only explanations
of that I know of is the 1947

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Roswell craft crash.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.710 align:middle line:84%
There was two alien crafts
operated by the Ebens flying

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:90%
around New Mexico.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:90%
There was a lightning storm.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, the lightning
storm affected their navigation

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.240 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And the two crafts collided,
one landing in Corona,

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico, north of Roswell,
and one landing way out

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:90%
near Magdalena or Horse Mesa.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:84%
They found the first
crash site, of course,

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:90%
a few days after crashed.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
The second site crash was
in a very remote area.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't found
for two years.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:84%
The alien that was
alive, or Eba 1,

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
we called them, in the
1947 crash at Corona,

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:84%
he explained to us in some
details how that craft crashed.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't talk about
any of the other crafts

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.140 align:middle line:84%
or how they crashed, because
I was never aware of how

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.063 align:middle line:90%
or why they crashed.

00:20:53.063 --> 00:20:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And what kind
of race was this?

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.647 align:middle line:90%
And what did they look like?

00:20:55.647 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The Ebens looked--
they were gray.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:84%
They're small gray,
about three to four foot,

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:84%
a gray, large eyes, typical
ones you see on TV now.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:90%
That was Eba, the Ebens.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're the race that
came from Serple, the planet

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Serple, which I think we're
going to discuss later.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you communicate
with these beings?

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Or were you debriefed
on the communications

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and maybe the videos and
audios of these investigations?

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Certainly I wasn't
around in 1947.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.390 align:middle line:90%
But we did.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:37.380 align:middle line:84%
We managed to
communicate with Eba 1.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And we did it by
somehow they planted

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a voice box
or a voice manipulator

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:90%
in his throat.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And he was able
to learn English.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, you got to
understand, according

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:84%
to our own people
and Eba 1, they

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
were like 5,000 years
ahead of us in technology.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So it was easy for him
to grasp our language.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for
us to grasp his language,

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:90%
but he was able to communicate.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.590 align:middle line:84%
He had a handler
assigned to him,

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:84%
an Air Force officer assigned
to him for the five years

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:84%
that he was around,
because Eba 1 died in 1952.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But during that time, he
provided a lot of information

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:90%
to US intelligence.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they nice,
treating him nice?

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Did he have his own bunk room?

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, how were they
knowing what to feed him?

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:84%
What were the details
that you heard?

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I read the debriefing.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I saw a film of him being
spoken with in a very

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.800 align:middle line:90%
relaxed environment.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.700 align:middle line:84%
It was very difficult to
understand what he was saying.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:90%
But he was treated very well.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:84%
He lived in Los Alamos, at a
special location at Los Alamos.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:84%
He was given food, I'm not
sure what type of food.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:84%
I know one particular person
that had knowledge of this

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.570 align:middle line:84%
wrote a story about
Eba 1, and he said

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:90%
he liked strawberry ice cream.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
what other food,

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.700 align:middle line:84%
but obviously we
were able to provide

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
nourishment, because he

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:90%
lived for five years.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure why he
died after five years.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But during that five year period
he told us where he came from.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:84%
He showed us where
his planet was.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:84%
He showed us the
different inequities

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:84%
between different
parts of space.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
He explained why
physics on Earth

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:84%
wasn't the same as
physics on his planet.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:84%
He explained a lot of
things to us that helped us.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>> So he was very cooperative?

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cooperative.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:48.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Did any of these beings
from these crashed vehicles,

00:23:48.822 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:84%
were they ever found with any
type of technology or weapons

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.690 align:middle line:90%
on them?

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Well the Ebens did.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.280 align:middle line:90%
The crash in 1947--

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:84%
not the first ship, not
the one that we were

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:90%
able to get the captured Eba 1.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't find
any weapons on that,

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
or they didn't, the people
that were searching.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.310 align:middle line:84%
But they did find an
energy device that

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:17.060 align:middle line:90%
could power almost anything.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And the second site in 1949,
where some ranchers found it up

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:25.790 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of nowhere, they
did find two weapons in there.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:90%
And they were pulse weapons.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.750 align:middle line:90%
They fired a pulse.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:90%
We didn't understand it.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think we could
really understand that

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.480 align:middle line:90%
until the middle '80s.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:90%
In fact, that weapon--

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.430 align:middle line:84%
there were actually two of them,
one larger and one smaller,

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that was being
tested at Area 51.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize
it at the time they

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:84%
were doing secret tests out
in another area of Area 51,

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:84%
actually North up near
Tonopah, in Tonopah Test Range.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was shooting
it against a mountain.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:90%
And it would vaporize anything.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.577 align:middle line:90%
It would go back 30 to 40 feet.

00:25:01.577 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Did it look like a gun?

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Did you see a picture of this?

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I saw it.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.320 align:middle line:90%
And I actually saw the pulse.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Could they direct the
wave pattern of that?

00:25:08.318 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Apparently they could.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.735 align:middle line:84%
Although, I wasn't close enough
to determine whether they

00:25:11.735 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:84%
could do that, nor did
I ever read any kind

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.400 align:middle line:90%
of technical literature on it.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.780 align:middle line:90%
I just saw it operate.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:90%
And I asked the guy.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, what the
heck is that thing?

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, that's one
of our research weapons

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:90%
that we got from the visitors.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:84%
This person I spoke with
always called them visitors.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.472 align:middle line:90%
And we're experimenting with it.

00:25:31.472 --> 00:25:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
how does it work?

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, they just
pull the trigger on it.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But there was some intensity
to it, an intensity level.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:90%
So they were able to lower it--

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Focus the beam.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Focus the beam.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And I saw--

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.430 align:middle line:90%
I only saw it fired once.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And it went into the
side of a mountain.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And this mountain was
called Urania Mountain,

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:90%
which is on a test range.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And it went back about
50 feet, because we

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.467 align:middle line:90%
went up later and looked at it.

00:25:56.467 --> 00:25:59.050 align:middle line:84%
It was a perfect hole that went
all the way back, like I said,

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.590 align:middle line:90%
about 50 feet.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I thought, my god, that
thing is something else.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think we're at
that technology today?

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I think we are.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I think we've obtained so
many different technologies

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:84%
from the extraterrestrials
over the years

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.830 align:middle line:84%
that we are now at
the point in time,

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and our technology has
advanced to the point where we

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.210 align:middle line:90%
are starting to understand it.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I was told a long time ago
by a very astute scientist

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.150 align:middle line:84%
in Texas that we
would bring out--

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.700 align:middle line:84%
we captured these
things for years.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.040 align:middle line:84%
We never could understand
it, like the Eben device,

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.360 align:middle line:90%
the energy device.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.360 align:middle line:84%
We would go, and pick it up, and
bring it back from Los Alamos,

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:84%
or wherever it was being
stored, and experiment with it.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And we were either at
our technology point

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.130 align:middle line:84%
where we could
understand it or not.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And we'd put it away
for a few more years.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.163 align:middle line:90%
We'd bring it back out.

00:26:58.163 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're at the
point where when

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:84%
we bring these things
back out, we're

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:90%
starting to understand them.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So there was a lot of alien
reverse engineering going on?

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of alien
reverse engineering.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> What corporations
were in charge of that?

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, EG&G was the primary
contractor at Groom Lake.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.500 align:middle line:84%
But we had the Air Force
Test Evaluation Center.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:27.130 align:middle line:10%
We had Tectronics, E-Systems,
Los Alamos Labs, Livermore

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.110 align:middle line:10%
Laboratories, Sandia Labs.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.390 align:middle line:10%
Sandia was probably
a prime contractor

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:10%
in the understanding the
propulsion system, especially

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:10%
what we thought was a
radioactive propulsion system

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:41.140 align:middle line:10%
or a nuclear propulsion system.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there anything else that
you can mention at Area 51 that

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.780 align:middle line:90%
really impacted you?

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that really, really
impacted me were the number

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.540 align:middle line:90%
of ETs that we had.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>> How many?

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I didn't
know the exact number,

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.860 align:middle line:84%
but I knew that there
were more than five.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I was told in the
neighborhood of 12 to 15.

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.200 align:middle line:90%
And where they came from.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I never read anything
the state where they came from,

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:14.590 align:middle line:84%
but some of them came from
areas close to our planet,

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:90%
as I was told.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of
the amazing things.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The other amazing thing there
is we were doing things.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:27.120 align:middle line:84%
We were advancing our
technology so fast

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:84%
that a scientist at
Sandia told me there

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:84%
were so many things
that we were finding out

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:84%
about alien technology that we
just had to put on the shelf

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.720 align:middle line:84%
because we just
couldn't understand it.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that he
told me about was time travel,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and how they manipulated it, and
they, the aliens, could do it.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.480 align:middle line:90%
We weren't quite there yet.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.640 align:middle line:90%
And this was in the middle '80s.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:58.650 align:middle line:84%
But I think now, in
2020, we might be there.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:28:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Where are we at now?

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, during
that time period,

00:29:01.295 --> 00:29:03.830 align:middle line:84%
during the '80s, we knew
they could time travel.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Eba 1 told us we
could time travel.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And he somehow showed
the scientists back

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.100 align:middle line:84%
in the late '40s, early
'50s how they did it.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:90%
We never understood it.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
things that we needed.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
We needed to manipulate
the space-time continuum.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
They could do it, and they
had a simple way to do it.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.470 align:middle line:84%
They tried to explain it to us,
but we didn't understand it.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.410 align:middle line:84%
But in 1980s when I
was at Area 51, one

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.428 align:middle line:90%
of the projects I worked on--

00:29:34.428 --> 00:29:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I was a counter
intelligence officer.

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I was a number one
officer on this--

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.940 align:middle line:84%
was a project that we
experimented with time travel.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And we tried-- and it was a
scientist Sandia Laboratories

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:84%
who is still alive today who
was in charge of that program.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's still classified.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And I could give
the project name,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:90%
but I'm afraid to do that now.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:90%
But it's still classified.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I worked on that
for quite a while.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And I watched the
experiments they did.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:11.130 align:middle line:84%
They built a huge underground
facility at Nevada Test Site

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:90%
with electric magnets.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And they were shooting things,
lasers and other things,

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:90%
And they were able to--

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:21.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Pew.

00:30:21.045 --> 00:30:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Disappear.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there
would be explosions.

00:30:22.758 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And there would be an
instant, just an instant

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
where the time
continuum opened up.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And they actually took high
speed camera shots of that.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And they could see
things into the future.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:39.150 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't keep it open long
enough to get somebody in there

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:42.450 align:middle line:90%
at that time, in 1985.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But they fired these
lasers, high energy lasers

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.800 align:middle line:84%
in between this,
and it opened up.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.450 align:middle line:90%
And I saw these pictures.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:84%
They were, you know,
like a split second.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.480 align:middle line:90%
But it would open up.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And you could see
things in that,

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:84%
as if you're looking
at the future.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was the future
or the past, I'm not sure.

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:90%
But they did this.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.490 align:middle line:90%
And what they found--

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of peripheral
programs that they found.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.630 align:middle line:84%
One of them was
energy weapon systems.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:16.180 align:middle line:84%
If they fired an energy
weapon with great velocity

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and great amount of
energy, they were

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:84%
able to vaporize
the time continuum.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And anything in that would
be totally vaporized.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:90%
There wouldn't be an atom left.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:29.780 align:middle line:90%
And they did that.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:84%
They took a tank,
an old M-61 tank,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:90%
and they put it on a platform.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.380 align:middle line:90%
And they fired.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:90%
They activated the magnets.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.600 align:middle line:90%
They fired this laser beam in.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And that M-61 tank,
totally vaporized.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.910 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't one single
atom left of that.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that we
developed into a weapon system,

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
or we were developing
into the weapons system.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they're
trying to prefect that.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Directed energy beam weapons?

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Directed energy
beam weapons, yes.

00:32:00.463 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And they got that
from the aliens.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, so we're
talking about time travel.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
This recent video
was released, you

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.203 align:middle line:84%
know, the little tic-tac
video of this craft.

00:32:10.203 --> 00:32:11.870 align:middle line:84%
They say, maybe it's
us from the future.

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know
anything about that.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it was
from the future or not.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:22.090 align:middle line:84%
But in the early 1980s, we
were experimenting with drones.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And we were
experimenting with them

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:90%
at Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.070 align:middle line:90%
We were flying drones.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And how they were doing it,
they would launch an aircraft,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.850 align:middle line:90%
an EC-135 aircraft.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.335 align:middle line:84%
They would then
shoot that drone out.

00:32:36.335 --> 00:32:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Drop it off, yeah.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Drop it out.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And they would control it
from inside the aircraft.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And they could make
that drone do things

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't believe
they could do, back

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.830 align:middle line:90%
in this is 1980, early 1980s.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And getting back to a guy by
the name of Paul Bennewitz.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Paul Bennewitz
filmed this stuff.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.812 align:middle line:84%
And he thought those little
drone things were UFOs.

00:32:56.812 --> 00:32:58.270 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality,
they were drones.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.650 align:middle line:90%
It was an experimental program.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.200 align:middle line:84%
It was highly classified
during that time period.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What were these drones
doing that were so amazing?

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.248 align:middle line:90%
>> They would stop in air.

00:33:06.248 --> 00:33:07.540 align:middle line:90%
They could shoot them and stop.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:10.120 align:middle line:84%
There was nobody-- no
pilot inside of them.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.670 align:middle line:90%
So they could stop it in air.

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And they had little
propulsion systems

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:18.400 align:middle line:84%
or something that would let
it float or hover in the air.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure how they did it.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:20.980 align:middle line:90%
But it could stop.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.990 align:middle line:90%
It could shoot and stop.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And it would drop and raise,
and it would shoot off again.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
how the propulsion

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:84%
system or their aerodynamics
worked of it, because I

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.010 align:middle line:84%
was never briefed into that
portion of it, but we saw them.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.330 align:middle line:90%
We saw them operate a lot.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.205 align:middle line:84%
And then they eventually
moved everything out

00:33:39.205 --> 00:33:42.010 align:middle line:84%
to Indian Springs Air
Force Base in Nevada.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Now on today's drones,
they look like planes

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:90%
in the military.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.140 align:middle line:90%
What do these drones look like?

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>> They looked like
55 gallon drums.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.900 align:middle line:84%
They looked exactly
like 55 gallon drums.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.780 align:middle line:84%
How they worked, how they
operated, I don't know.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:90%
But I saw them.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.050 align:middle line:90%
I saw them stop in the air.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.332 align:middle line:84%
And that fascinated me,
trying to figure out,

00:34:01.332 --> 00:34:02.540 align:middle line:90%
how could it stop in the air?

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, how could something
fly and then stop?

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, a
plane couldn't do

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.562 align:middle line:84%
that cause the Gs
would kill a pilot.

00:34:10.562 --> 00:34:11.770 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't have a pilot.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:15.880 align:middle line:84%
It was all being controlled
by the controller aircraft.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, they
have their own--

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:22.900 align:middle line:84%
these anti-gravitic craft
have their own energy density

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:29.760 align:middle line:84%
They're basically within
their own atmosphere.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, that's a
good way to explain it.

00:34:31.614 --> 00:34:33.239 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the simple
way to explain it.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a simple
way to explain it.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they're creating
their own gravitational field.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So the gravitational
field outside

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.860 align:middle line:90%
doesn't affect them at all.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yes.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What impact have these
experiences had on you

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.750 align:middle line:90%
personally?

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've managed over
the years to accept it.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:52.219 align:middle line:84%
There are some things
that still bother me.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:53.330 align:middle line:90%
I think about it.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I think about some of
the things that occurred.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things that
we're doing out at Groom Lake

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and Tonopah, and Nevada
Test Range, I think

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.930 align:middle line:84%
could be harming
the environment.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're sending things up,
like energy beam weapons that

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:17.060 align:middle line:90%
are polarizing the atmosphere.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And now, what happens when that
atmosphere, those polarization

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.280 align:middle line:90%
molecules come back to Earth?

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's studying
that out there.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that we were concerned

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.300 align:middle line:84%
about in the '80s, and
I know they're probably

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:90%
still concerned about it.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.140 align:middle line:84%
If environmentalists
knew everything

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that was occurring out at
Nellis Test and Training Range,

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:39.900 align:middle line:84%
including Tonopah
and Groom Lake,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:84%
there would be probably
demonstrations at the gate.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:49.080 align:middle line:84%
The EPA I guess doesn't have a
badge to get into those areas.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I don't
think EPA, or OSHA--

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Anything goes out there.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:54.910 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Anything goes.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, fascinating
information.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much for
coming on the show.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very welcome.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:15.000 align:middle line:90%
