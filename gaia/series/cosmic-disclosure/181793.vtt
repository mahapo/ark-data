>>GEORGE NOORY: We can
learn languages, skills,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:10%
abilities, but is it possible to
develop or advance your skills,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.400 align:middle line:10%
like telepathy?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Our dear friend, Emery Smith.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.045 align:middle line:90%
Hello, there.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Hi,
George, how are you?

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.014 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You are a master
of many topics, my friend.

00:00:36.014 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's
a lot I've been through

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:90%
and a lot I need to share.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: My aunt was a
psychiatrist and devoted

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:84%
her entire practice to
the art of telepathy,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.030 align:middle line:84%
but she was convinced
that telepathy

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:84%
was real, could be taught,
but some people had

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:90%
this innate ability to do it.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.954 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I
agree with that.

00:00:56.954 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:10%
I think some people
are just born--

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:10%
through lineage
passed down from them

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:10%
genetically-- that they have
a gift of telepathy already.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:84%
My case was a little
bit different.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I was able to learn
it through someone

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:90%
who already knew telepathy.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to learn
telepathy just on your own.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:90%
You need a good teacher.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.995 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You need a really good
teacher, someone that's already

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:22.300 align:middle line:84%
mastered the art of it because
it takes a lot of dropping

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:84%
the mind and emotion down
to communicate through space

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and time, and that's
what it's really about.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It's about using more
of an emotional feeling

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:84%
in replacement of
words, I'll say.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Yet some of us, Emery,
have this incredible ability

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:90%
to do this on our own.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I think we're born
with it, aren't we?

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, everyone
is born with this ability,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
it's just we've been suppressed
by all sorts of things,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.820 align:middle line:84%
from the foods we eat, and
the scalar interferometry,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and electromagnetic fields,
and things like this that

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
have to do with that
part of the brain

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and that part of
the body that allows

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.600 align:middle line:84%
us to signal each other
without using vocalization.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
It still is a type of
frequency you're picking up,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:84%
but it's from within
time and space.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: When ET abductees
talk to us, all of them

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
say they communicated
with me telepathically.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Is this like a universal
language, telepathy?

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's the
universal language, definitely.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:84%
The language of our
future is really

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:84%
just a bunch of computer coding
and numbers and telepathy.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be small
devices in the future that

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:84%
will help with
telepathy, that will plug

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:84%
into the back of your ear, kind
of like an earring-type thing,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:84%
or placed inside the
ear, which will enhance

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
the ability of telepathy between
multiple people at one time,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:90%
conversations going on.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So you'll definitely
see this technology,

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I think, coming out in
the next decade as well.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: With telepathy, we
can do some incredible things.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
But how do we know
we're telepathic,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
or if it's not just that
little inner voice in our head

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:90%
telling us something?

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.425 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it's kind of
like you start picking up

00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
on things like
maybe someone will

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
pop into your mind,
a family member.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then all of
a sudden your phone rings

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:90%
and it's them.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And you knew about it 5 to 30
seconds before it happened.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is a form of
awareness, awareness that's

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:90%
opening up a form of telepathy.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of remote viewers
have this telepathy.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It's something that everyone is
born with, and it's kind of now

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.910 align:middle line:84%
being brought up because this
is how the future will be,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.739 align:middle line:84%
and there will be no
more telephone lines.

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is it the
brain that's doing this

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
or is there something
else outside of the brain?

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, no.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.800 align:middle line:84%
You're sending-- every
thought is energy,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.305 align:middle line:84%
and energy affects
this whole field,

00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:84%
whether you want to call
it the morphogenetic field

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
or whatever field, or pop
culture term you want to use,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.520 align:middle line:90%
it's here and it's a conductor.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:90%
It's full of conductivity.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when
someone walks in the room

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.659 align:middle line:84%
and they're angry, it can
change the whole mood of--

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:21.909 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And you can feel it.

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it from this guy.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.671 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, and
you're going to pick up

00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:84%
on this because the vibratory
energy that we carry

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
is-- we're very
sensitive to this.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And I always teach my students--

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:84%
basically get a deck of cards,
try to get a couple of cards

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Guess what they are.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --and
guess what they are.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.299 align:middle line:84%
And most of my students are
all 10 on 10 every time.

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's amazing.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And anyone
can learn this.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're a
special superhero or anything.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be willing
enough to put the time into it,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and you have to be
willing enough to--

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.870 align:middle line:84%
like you said, you
got to clear yourself

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
before walking into a room full
of clairvoyants and people that

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:84%
are telepathic--
because if I'm angry,

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and I walk into an operating
room with an extraterrestrial,

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
then through telepathy say,
hello, but inside I have anger,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be like, hello!

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.740 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be like,
they're going to take it

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:90%
in a totally different way.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But they're more
aware that we're still

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.730 align:middle line:84%
learning this language,
and it's something

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:90%
that comes from the heart.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So you have to take a deep
breath, you have to relax.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:84%
You got to get rid
of all your issues

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:84%
you got going on
before you start

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:84%
working on these projects
with these different beings

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:90%
because they pick up on it.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And also, it can be very
comical at the same time.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, absolutely.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.034 align:middle line:90%
Are governments using telepathy?

00:05:48.034 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, oh, yes.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How so?

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they're
using it for long--

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:84%
instead of using like the
internet or phone or anything

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with
electrical, there's

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
actually telepathy agents that
communicate across the world

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.590 align:middle line:84%
as freely as we would
pick up a cell phone

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:90%
and talk to each other.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:90%
And they're 100% accurate, and--

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --they're just that in
tune and work together a lot.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:84%
The more they work together,
the better it gets.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a very
great experience with one

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:84%
of my colleagues during
our CE-5 expeditions

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and things like this,
where we could immediately

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:84%
be having a conversation
amongst people,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's very clear where
there would be no mistakes.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I call it the
wireless internet, basically,

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
where you can communicate
wirelessly to individuals

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and accomplish all
kinds of things.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, that's the
other thing with telepathy,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.850 align:middle line:84%
it can manifest too when
you get really good at it,

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:90%
and it can manifest things.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
You can manifest positive
energy amongst someone

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
around the world, or it's
also a form of healing.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is it like
remote viewing, too?

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It is.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:84%
It's all connected in
a very similar way.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing is
a little different

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.740 align:middle line:84%
because you're just
tapping into the field.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.081 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Telepathy,
I'm intentionally

00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate
with you or a being,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and the other person usually
is aware of that too.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's no guessing
going on, where

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle line:90%
we're actually already engaged.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:84%
With remote viewing, you're
tapping into something unaware

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and picking up on different
shapes and colors and things

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and putting that together to
allow someone else to come

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:84%
to a conclusion of what you
just drew or wrote on the paper.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So it is a little different,
but it uses the same field.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If I want to
telepathically send something

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to someone, can
you intercept it?

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.950 align:middle line:84%
What if I, me to
them, and you're here,

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:84%
can you intercept
what my thoughts were?

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You can, but if
you're really good at this,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.394 align:middle line:84%
you can also just have
a two-way conversation.

00:08:03.394 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And block you out?

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And block me out
and block everyone else out

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:90%
in the room.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But what if you're
strong enough to basically--

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You can intercept
telepathy energies

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.299 align:middle line:84%
and contact between
individuals and spy on them.

00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Isn't that what
the government Stargate

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.050 align:middle line:90%
program basically was?

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.707 align:middle line:84%
It was a remote viewing program,
but it was a spying program.

00:08:25.707 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It was a remote, right.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a spying remote
viewing program.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.772 align:middle line:84%
That things are in the air
and things are all over,

00:08:32.772 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
grasping at these things

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and pulling them together
and putting it together,

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.750 align:middle line:84%
kind of like back in the old
days when we were picking up

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.120 align:middle line:84%
radio transmissions
from our enemies,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying
to decipher things.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And they might hear
keywords and then

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:84%
they would have to
put that together.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's information
everywhere right now,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:90%
all at your access.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But to be aware of it
is a whole other thing

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.480 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much of
it right here in this space.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.791 align:middle line:84%
How do you hone in on
just this conversation?

00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: As opposed
to another one?

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.581 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right, or another one.

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And that takes training, and it
just takes a lot of training.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you ever
communicated telepathically

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:90%
with an ET?

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, absolutely,
on my daily work.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I was with
an extraterrestrial

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.360 align:middle line:84%
or part of a project with an
extraterrestrial, many times,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.900 align:middle line:84%
of course, working across
the table from one.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:90%
They kind of already know--

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to block myself
back then, so I would walk in

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and they would
chuckle or something.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Said, oh, you had a good
night last night or something

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.115 align:middle line:90%
funny to that effect.

00:09:41.115 --> 00:09:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Or you're going to have a
good weekend because they

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
know I'm going out on a
date with a new girlfriend

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of
comical to me because I

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
couldn't hide anything, but
they knew everything about me.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But it also opened
me up to being

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:84%
like your complete self
because to allow people

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:84%
with telepathy into
your field, I'll say,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
you get to basically
not have any secrets--

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and relationships seem
to go very well when

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:90%
there's no secrets--

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and you also get a
very loyal honor system

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.070 align:middle line:90%
going with someone, ET or not--

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --that has
telepathy because it's

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:84%
kind of intimate in a way
because you both are connected

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:84%
in a interesting energetic way
and you share the same energy

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
for a short period of time, for
that minute or that 30 seconds.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How does
telepathy work

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:90%
beyond the barrier of language?

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you and I are
speaking English right now.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Telepathically, you understand
what an ET may be sending you,

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.530 align:middle line:84%
but they could be talking
in Jabba for all we know.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.660 align:middle line:90%
How do you decipher that?

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's
a download actually.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And before I take people out on
these expeditions to possibly,

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:84%
maybe see an ET or
meet one, I make

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:84%
sure they memorize
about 150 questions.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: 150?

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You have to
memorize about 100,

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:19.450 align:middle line:84%
150 questions because when
you meet an extraterrestrial,

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.010 align:middle line:84%
you don't have
usually much time.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Give me
one of the questions.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Oh, you know,
where are you from?

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a family?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:90%
What is your--

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.171 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you send
that telepathically?

00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:33.764 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Telepathically,
but it's already memorized,

00:11:33.764 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're thinking about
just your questions.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.586 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And you're going
through them in your mind,

00:11:38.586 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and soon as you're there, within
less than a second of being

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:84%
in the field and making
contact, all your questions

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:90%
are answered within a second.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So now you're just
sitting there--

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.818 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do
you decipher that?

00:11:50.818 --> 00:11:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --smiling,
crying possibly,

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.435 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, my goodness,
that was like a download.

00:11:58.435 --> 00:12:03.565 align:middle line:84%
Your brain just now has answered
everything, and you have it.

00:12:03.565 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you pick
them up one at a time,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.690 align:middle line:90%
or how do you do that?

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, no.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:90%
It's you already know.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:90%
It's everything immediately.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Just like that?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Just like
that, within a second.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then you're
sitting there like a silly--

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.619 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I can't
remember five questions.

00:12:15.619 --> 00:12:17.020 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to remember 150?

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you
do these things

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:84%
when you're part of
the team, and if you're

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.190 align:middle line:90%
doing it for a long time.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And the worst thing about it
is once you get answered--

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:90%
whatever, 100, 150 questions--

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:84%
it just makes you want
to ask another 1,000

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:90%
questions because--

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.773 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Right,
you're hungry for it.

00:12:34.773 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --now it's just, oh, my
goodness, well, if that's true,

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.090 align:middle line:90%
then well, and then--

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.160 align:middle line:90%
but that's kind of how it works.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do you
know it's working?

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.820 align:middle line:90%
How do you know it's accurate?

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, because
of the meeting,

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:84%
which is usually a positive
meeting, an arranged meeting--

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Between?

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Between ET and human.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: OK.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: This is a normal thing.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
usually a reason

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:84%
to hide or lie unless
it's a question that

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:11.620 align:middle line:84%
will cause damage or affect
the future or something.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very respected
professional-type meeting.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:84%
This is a meeting that
when you're there,

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.850 align:middle line:90%
it's a prepared thing.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Does telepathy
have any bounds?

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:84%
How far can you telepathically
send a message to someone?

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Can I send one to you on
another planet, for example?

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's
no space in time

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:84%
because when we're trying to
make contact in the field,

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.510 align:middle line:84%
we're sending out the energy of
where we're at on planet Earth,

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and we're zooming out, showing
our own visual in our brain

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:51.062 align:middle line:84%
and projecting that
into interstellar space.

00:13:51.062 --> 00:13:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wherever it may go.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Wherever it may go.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
like I said, there's

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:84%
information everywhere that
gets picked up and grabbed.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
extraterrestrials out there

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:84%
that are looking
for these signals.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And they pick up
on it, and they see

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:12.059 align:middle line:84%
there's a group of people that
are all projecting this area,

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and they want-- and there's
no one there that has fear,

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and they do want
to make contact.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And they log on to
this like a laser beam,

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and they start to
travel to this area.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:10%
It could be inter-dimensionally.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
It could be actually through
just regular linear space

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:90%
and time.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:90%
It could be nonlinear.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So they are coming though, and
they do come and make contact

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.710 align:middle line:90%
in this fashion.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:90%
So it is an unlimited--

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
it's not so much, don't think of
it as from 4 feet from yourself

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.065 align:middle line:84%
to I, think of it
as there is no--

00:14:53.065 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:90%
we're already connected.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.330 align:middle line:84%
We already are in the same
universe, the same space.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why would you
use telepathy as opposed

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:90%
to picking up a smartphone?

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, telepathy,
number one, is easier.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Telepathy, the message is a
lot clearer than even language,

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.096 align:middle line:90%
talking or texting, for sure.

00:15:13.096 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Can't be tracked.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.344 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think texting
is the most horrible thing

00:15:16.344 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:84%
because you can
take that sentence

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.520 align:middle line:90%
in many different ways.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:90%
So I'm really against texting.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm a--

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.051 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: We've all been there.

00:15:23.051 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --horrible texter.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And even speaking can
also be misinterpreted

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:84%
depending on the mood and
emotion of the person.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Because when you speak, you
also are projecting energy.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And every time I'm on the show
and people are listening to me,

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.220 align:middle line:90%
I am projecting telepathy.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm also projecting
positivity and hoping

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.780 align:middle line:84%
that the listeners
are receiving this

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and being receptive
in a positive way.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.035 align:middle line:90%
So it's in the voice.

00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.270 align:middle line:84%
People really listen
to what you're saying.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear it in someone's
voice if they're being genuine,

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:84%
if they're not being
genuine, or if they're

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:10.120 align:middle line:84%
lying, if they're being
upset about something

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:90%
and being judgmental.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.440 align:middle line:84%
All this is through
the frequency,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.600 align:middle line:90%
even through just voice.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.880 align:middle line:90%
So voice is a very-- also--

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.340 align:middle line:84%
thing you have to be careful
with, especially when you're

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.340 align:middle line:90%
talking to other countries and--

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.516 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --other races with
different languages just here

00:16:26.516 --> 00:16:27.315 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:16:27.315 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How would
you use telepathy?

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:90%
In what areas?

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I use
telepathy in my relationships

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:90%
with people and colleagues.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I use it also with
projects that I'm

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to accomplish
with the governments,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and also when I'm working with
scientists in the labs, which

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.320 align:middle line:90%
I still do to this day.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
There's something
there besides saying,

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.800 align:middle line:84%
you should do it
this way or that way.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:84%
You can project it
and insinuate it.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And humans are a little
bit egoed at times--

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No, not humans.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.435 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And we sometimes--

00:17:10.435 --> 00:17:12.109 align:middle line:90%
you have to be delicate.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:15.369 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm communicating,
or when people are asking me

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.490 align:middle line:84%
how to solve a problem,
I'll use my telepathy

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.462 align:middle line:84%
to help them get on
the same page as me.

00:17:21.462 --> 00:17:22.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a control thing.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a free choice, but as
I'm explaining something,

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:84%
like I'm explaining
now, like I said,

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.190 align:middle line:84%
it's about listening
and also projecting--

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --to get a positive
outcome for the mission

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you're doing.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you do it as a
conversation telepathically

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.450 align:middle line:84%
with and ET, or
human, or whomever?

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, on the
projects with the ETs, yes.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Not so much now in the labs.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with
the civilian stuff.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:56.900 align:middle line:84%
But I do have a few
scientists that I currently

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:84%
work with that have
the ability to do that.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And we will use it actually
back and forth in conjunction

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:90%
with talking.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If you've
ever been a pet owner,

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.950 align:middle line:84%
you just know that there's
a connection between you

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:84%
and the animal, whether
it's a cat or a dog.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:84%
They know intuitively
what's going on.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to
project telepathically

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.332 align:middle line:84%
a thing, a thought to
you and vice versa.

00:18:21.332 --> 00:18:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Have you tried that
with an animal?

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.620 align:middle line:84%
The first time I
learned about telepathy

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:84%
was not in the projects,
it was on the farm,

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:84%
growing up with the animals
because I was always

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:38.777 align:middle line:84%
around dogs and cats
and horses and cows.

00:18:38.777 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You were born into it.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I
was born into this.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was just me
and the animals.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:84%
I was always a pretty solo kid
growing up with these animals.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And I remember-- one
of those tragic times

00:18:53.830 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:84%
was a moment where I was
camping out and one of my dogs

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:07.153 align:middle line:84%
ran into the tent and looked
at me and said, Shadow is dead.

00:19:07.153 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I
just looked at her.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.537 align:middle line:90%
How did you just say that?

00:19:12.537 --> 00:19:13.870 align:middle line:90%
And I just ran out of the tent--

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's like
you heard her, right?

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.738 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --and I ran-- yeah--

00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:20.202 align:middle line:84%
and I ran out of the tent, and
there's my dog Shadow, dead.

00:19:20.202 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Must've got bitten by
a rattler, I think.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But the fact that
it happened, I was just so--

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and I look back at, she was
a wire-haired terrier, a mix,

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
a mutt, and Shadow was
a Brittany spaniel--

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and I was so still
in shock, number one,

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.350 align:middle line:90%
that I just lost my best friend.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And number two, the dog is
still looking me in the eyes

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.137 align:middle line:84%
to know that I
accepted this message.

00:19:49.137 --> 00:19:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Told you--

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right, right--

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Kind of thing.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So I picked up the dog
and I ran a half a mile home.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my family
coming out on the porch

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.540 align:middle line:90%
hearing me yelling--

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:06.210 align:middle line:84%
my mother and father and my
sister, and one of her friends

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:90%
who had just flown in--

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.340 align:middle line:90%
and I said, Shadow is dead.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Shadow's dead.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Sneakers told me.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.341 align:middle line:84%
Sneakers was the little
dog that told me.

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:17.340 align:middle line:90%
And they're looking at--

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.923 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That they
didn't understand.

00:20:18.923 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then I'm
like, Sneakers told me.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
You can-- and, of
course, they're

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:84%
looking at me like I'm
bat nut crazy here.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, that was the
first time where I really

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.379 align:middle line:90%
respected like the connection--

00:20:36.379 --> 00:20:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: With an animal.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.461 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: With the animal.

00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:40.556 align:middle line:84%
And I was probably
around the age of,

00:20:40.556 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, maybe
11, 10 or 11, I think.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Telepathy is a language.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a universal language.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not like-- and China has
all these dialects, you know?

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And even when you go to Italy,
you can go into another city

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's like a
little bit different.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's no misunderstanding
with telepathy.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.957 align:middle line:84%
OK, you're not hearing
in another language.

00:21:06.957 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What about
emotion with telepathy?

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Like the dog, I'm
sure the dog when

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.190 align:middle line:84%
it told you that the other
one was dead, was emotional?

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Was in a panic
state of emergency,

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:84%
like get out here and help
this, help my brother.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Telepathy is about thinking
of what you want to say,

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.660 align:middle line:90%
but emotionally projecting it.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:84%
So I would project something
in a neutral emotion.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I would project it in a happy
or a loving, or in a panic,

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.640 align:middle line:90%
or in an emergency.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I need help type thing.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So you are saying
it in your brain--

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --but you have
to put emotion behind it

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:90%
or it won't go nowhere.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.394 align:middle line:90%
Because it's the emotion--

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That sends it out?

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --and energy that sends
it out, and that's the secret.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So the more
emotion, the easier it is?

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You think?

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, absolutely.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Huh.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Is it coming from your brain?

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Or where is it coming
from, the telepathy?

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it's coming
from all over, the whole body.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Because your body and
every cell in your body

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.450 align:middle line:84%
activates when you
have an emotion.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why chemicals
are released in your brain

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:84%
during emergency
situations, like adrenaline.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It sets a different
vibratory effect.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So all your cells are
actually talking to each other

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and vibrating back
and forth, and they're

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:90%
building up this emotion--

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --frequency, that
you utilize to send out

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:90%
by thinking about it.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.675 align:middle line:84%
Because when you think about
it, you're being aware.

00:22:35.675 --> 00:22:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's an
incredible gift

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.767 align:middle line:84%
if you can use it
and use it right.

00:22:38.767 --> 00:22:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It is, and we're all
going to be doing it soon.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: When you say, we're
all going to be doing it,

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.399 align:middle line:84%
is it going to be
like out of necessity?

00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, it'll be a choice.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I mean, is something
going to happen to us?

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.635 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:22:51.635 --> 00:22:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
there's going to be

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:84%
some big shower of
light that comes down

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.060 align:middle line:90%
and we're all enlightened.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think enlightenment
takes time and patience.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, it's a
gift for some of these people

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:84%
that are already born
with it, but it's also

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:90%
something we have to work at.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like any language, we
just don't like pick it up,

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.820 align:middle line:84%
but there's ways to pick
up language a lot faster--

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --by using
different techniques.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think once we conquer
that, and more people that

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:84%
know telepathy come
forward and start actually

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:84%
teaching like we
teach this, that it's

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:84%
going to be a little
bit easier for people

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.530 align:middle line:84%
to understand because no one
wants to put the time in.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Like, why would I want
to learn telepathy?

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.577 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what do I
need it in my daily--

00:23:38.577 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Oh, well, what
am I going to use it for.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --life.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't want George telling me
what to do, or this or that.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.920 align:middle line:84%
It's something that you really
have to consciously want

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:84%
to be part of and put
the effort into it

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and practice with your
family and friends.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.425 align:middle line:84%
And it can be a
really fun thing.

00:23:58.425 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you ever
picked up the emotion

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:84%
of an extraterrestrial
telepathically?

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:90%
Do they--

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, absolutely.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.425 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: --show you anything?

00:24:04.425 --> 00:24:06.216 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's the
first thing you pick up

00:24:06.216 --> 00:24:07.740 align:middle line:90%
before a conversation happens.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:84%
It's usually a very
overwhelmingly happy

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes their frequency
emotion is so high vibratory

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.810 align:middle line:90%
that it'll affect you.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Like for instance--

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --you see someone--

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:26.460 align:middle line:84%
a good example would be like I
see this happen to women a lot.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:84%
They see someone crying,
two women will be crying,

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and another woman walks by and
sees this and now she's crying.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's like this emotion,
people that are all crying.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And men too, I mean,
it's just like that.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.820 align:middle line:84%
You have an emotional connection
first and then from there.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are
times where the ET

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:90%
might be frustrated with you.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And you can feel that--

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You can
feel that emotion?

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You feel this
frustration and emotion.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And that gets to be put together
into your brain as a language

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.390 align:middle line:90%
that you understand.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, I'm sorry.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I know you're frustrated
with me because I just

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:17.070 align:middle line:84%
dropped this instrument,
but it's something you know.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.270 align:middle line:90%
You're not guessing at it.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just you feel
it and the message

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.680 align:middle line:90%
comes along with it sometimes.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There are studies that
show that some people are more

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:84%
prone to have telepathic or
psychic abilities than others,

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.020 align:middle line:90%
genetically.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.920 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, I've heard
I've heard about this.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And we have studied this
for a very, very long time--

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:84%
the government, I mean, and
other institutions-- and that's

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.600 align:middle line:84%
why I brought it up
because of learning

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:51.417 align:middle line:84%
under these great scholars that
it is a lineage-related thing.

00:25:51.417 --> 00:25:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's remarkable.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And but no one talks
about what kind of lineage

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and where the lineage came from,
which I hope to someday expose.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with a
lot of different things,

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.910 align:middle line:84%
but of course, it's
extraterrestrial-based.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They gave it to us?

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: When they were
making us, I'll say.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And when we were interbreeding
through the cosmos,

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.640 align:middle line:90%
through other extraterrestrials.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Just like here on
planet Earth, we

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.030 align:middle line:84%
are interbreeding
with all races.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So we have a little
bit of everyone.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, guess what's happening
in the universe with all

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget that we all still
have human DNA, even they do.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
interbreeding with that.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And at one time there
was interbreeding here

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.040 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that
old, old, old lineage

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.510 align:middle line:90%
has survived in some people.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And it only takes one person
in the beginning of time

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:52.300 align:middle line:84%
to spread the lineage of
this to a billion people.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What would
you say, Emery,

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.620 align:middle line:84%
is the best gift
having telepathy?

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.640 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think the
biggest gift for that

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.870 align:middle line:90%
is actually knowing someone.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:05.819 align:middle line:90%
Telepathy gives you--

00:27:05.819 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You mean
through telepathy?

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Through
telepathy, you really get

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:middle line:84%
to know the core of someone
because we are just shells

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a shell.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking at
me and reading my face

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and listening to
me, but you don't

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:84%
know everything
I've been through

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:90%
and everything about me.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:24.791 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Of course, not.

00:27:24.791 --> 00:27:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: But like I said--

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But I might
through telepathy?

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But through
telepathy you

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:29.741 align:middle line:90%
get a little bit more intimate.

00:27:29.741 --> 00:27:31.510 align:middle line:84%
You get sometimes
bits and pieces

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:35.070 align:middle line:84%
of who the person's
real heart stands for.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, what their
true intention is.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was like the
biggest gift out of telepathy

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I ever received was really
reading people and really

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:51.820 align:middle line:84%
knowing their intentions
and making good judgment

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.585 align:middle line:84%
calls in projects,
which saved lives,

00:27:55.585 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and moving forward, and
creating things that save lives.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:05.255 align:middle line:84%
And so it really was a big
stepping stone for me, I think.
