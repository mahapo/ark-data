00:00:19.808 --> 00:00:21.600 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.260 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who served

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:10%
in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO/ET-related

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.060 align:middle line:10%
intelligence.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing
five years of missing time.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD C. DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So who was
Lieutenant Gary Anderson?

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Lieutenant Gary
Anderson was a nuclear weapons

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.090 align:middle line:84%
technician in the
United States Air Force.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.060 align:middle line:84%
He started his career as
a young second Lieutenant

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
in the Air Force, and he went
through Nuclear Weapons School.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.650 align:middle line:10%
And his first assignment
was to McChord Air Force

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:10%
Base in Washington.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: And what
were his duties there?

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:10%
>> DOTY: He was a supervisor
within the nuclear weapons

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:10%
maintenance section of the
three 18th Fighter Interceptor

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:10%
Squadron.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:10%
His job was to supervise
other nuclear technicians,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.770 align:middle line:10%
maintain the nuclear weapons
that were stored at McChord Air

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:10%
Force Base during
that time period,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:10%
and those weapons were
air to air rockets.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:10%
They're called Genies, and
they contained a W25 warhead,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:10%
which was a 1.7 kiloton yield.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And where was Lieutenant
Anderson on August 11, 1970?

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Lieutenant Anderson
was inside the maintenance bay

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:84%
inside the weapons
storage area of the base.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very secure
area because nuclear weapons

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:90%
are stored in there.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
The maintenance area is where
they bring the nuclear weapons

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
in to perform
maintenance, and they

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
call it limited life
component maintenance,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:84%
meaning there's certain
components that they have

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:90%
to change out periodically.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:10%
And they also prepare
them for pre-flight,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.550 align:middle line:10%
meaning when they are
placed on the aircraft,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:10%
the aircraft's during that time
period with the F-106 fighters,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.680 align:middle line:10%
and when the weapons were
taken off and brought back

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:10%
to the storage area, they
had to go through maintenance

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:10%
for a maintenance check to
make sure they weren't armed,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:10%
and he was working inside that
maintenance facility on August

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:10%
11, 1970.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what details
are available leading up

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
to the circumstances of
Anderson's contact experience?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, he was inside the
maintenance facility on August

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:90%
11, 1970.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.750 align:middle line:84%
He was working with four other
nuclear weapons technicians.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:84%
He was supervising
them while they

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
were performing
general maintenance

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:90%
on the nuclear weapon.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:10%
And he walked over to a toolbox
to get a tool, at which time

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:10%
there was a bright light that
was directed right over top

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:10%
of him, and the other
four technicians witnessed

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:10%
him then disappearing.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.780 align:middle line:90%
So now we have a problem.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.460 align:middle line:84%
The supervisor inside a nuclear
weapon maintenance facility

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:90%
disappeared.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So they immediately-- the
technicians immediately

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.830 align:middle line:84%
notified the next
commander in the chain

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:90%
of command, who was a captain.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:90%
The captain responded.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
The technicians informed
him that Lieutenant Anderson

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.510 align:middle line:90%
was standing over there.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:90%
There was a bolt--

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:90%
they thought lightning at first.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:84%
They came through, and now
he's not there anymore.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
There was only one
way in and one way out

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:90%
of this igloo-type area.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Through the door,
going in and going out.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:90%
They didn't see him go out.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
There weren't any cameras or
anything in the facilities

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:90%
back in those days.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So the captain immediately
notified the commander--

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:90%
the base commander.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:90%
They started a search.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Security police was involved in
a search of inside the weapons

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:84%
storage area and
all over the base.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
They figured he had
to be someplace.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.902 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
OSI was brought in.

00:04:00.902 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What was
their emotional state?

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this-- this
doesn't happen every day

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.685 align:middle line:90%
on these nuclear bases.

00:04:06.685 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: That's true.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And these four technicians,
some of them were young.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:90%
They were under 20 years old.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I think there was
one that was 19.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
One had just gotten
in-- hadn't been there

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:90%
for more than a few months.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
He just got out of
a technical school,

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and there were two more
senior technicians.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And this happened only a few
feet away from where they were.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And they were shocked,
totally shocked.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And the senior person, I
believe he was a staff sergeant,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.200 align:middle line:84%
he reacted first by
going over to look

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:84%
at where Lieutenant
Anderson had been,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and then realized he's
not there anymore.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And they started looking
around to try to figure out

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:90%
what happened to him.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.910 align:middle line:84%
The first thought, the
Staff Sergeant said,

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:84%
was somehow a bolt
of lightning came

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
through this very thick,
concreted, reinforced structure,

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%
which would have been
almost impossible.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
But then he looked around
to try to figure out maybe

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.070 align:middle line:84%
it was something
else that occurred,

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and Anderson went
to hide someplace.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:84%
But they are inside
this igloo and there

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.538 align:middle line:90%
wasn't any place to hide.

00:05:12.538 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, take
me step by step.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:90%
You're an OSI agent.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.870 align:middle line:90%
What is that protocol?

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:84%
After you're contacted, you
guys are doing the interviews,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:90%
where did it go from there?

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, they
would have two teams,

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
one going in and interviewing
the witnesses and another team,

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:90%
evidence collection team--

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.680 align:middle line:84%
some within that team would be
specially trained to collect

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:90%
evidentiary information.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And what they did find was
one burnt mark on the ceiling.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a hole, but
there was a burnt mark.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, analyzed
this burnt mark.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.580 align:middle line:84%
They took scrapings
and evidence,

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.322 align:middle line:84%
but the burnt mark was
just on the ceiling.

00:05:54.322 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anything
on the floor.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.655 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's a
concrete ceiling, correct?

00:05:57.655 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, concrete
ceiling and concrete floor.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they went outside
and looked on top of the--

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:84%
top of this building,
which is dirt and they

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
didn't see any
burnt mark up there.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So they were very suspicious
of why this burnt mark was only

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
on the ceiling and not on the
floor or not on the outside.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it possible that
this light came from within

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:90%
the bunker?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, I think
they thought that.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.270 align:middle line:90%
But there wasn't anything.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't find
anything inside that would

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:90%
have generated that much light.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
big question is, where

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:90%
did Lieutenant Anderson go?

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:90%
There was no exit points.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
These maintenance areas are
built for security purposes.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.375 align:middle line:84%
And just in case
this weapon exploded,

00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:84%
not the nuclear part, but
the conventional part,

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
because remember, it's a
sphere and the interior

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.890 align:middle line:90%
is the nuclear part.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:84%
The exterior is the
conventional part.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
The conventional part
crushes the nuclear part,

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:90%
which causes the detonation.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So if there was
just an explosion

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:84%
of the conventional
explosives, it

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
would be maintained
in this area.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So they knew he
couldn't go beyond.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
They would-- he would
have had to fake some way

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.030 align:middle line:84%
to get beyond through
that one door,

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:90%
past these nuclear technicians.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And they
couldn't figure it out.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.110 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was
they immediately got--

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:84%
contacted the FBI and
with the FBI and with OSI,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:84%
they went out to
search his apartment.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Anderson was
single, had never been married.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:84%
He'd been in the Air
Force for 3 and 1/2 years.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:84%
His car was parked at a
parking area on the base,

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and it was a 1967
Chevrolet Camaro.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.330 align:middle line:90%
And so they took the car.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't missing.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.140 align:middle line:90%
It was still there.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:90%
So he didn't drive it away.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So how did he get away
if he'd planned this?

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
They also checked
the perimeter area.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
This nuclear weapon storage area
had a very intensive security

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
system around it, because it
had nuclear weapons in it.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And outside that is
the base perimeter.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And the base perimeter
also had security.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
They checked the
security people.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
They checked the
security police.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:84%
They checked the alarm
systems that were out

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:90%
on the outer perimeter.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Nothing activated.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't go out through
any of the fences or the gates.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's only one way into
the nuclear weapon storage area,

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:90%
and that's through a man gate.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:90%
A security police have--

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:84%
you have to go through and
you have to submit a badge

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:90%
and to get into this area.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
way in and one way out.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And in this building, there's
only one way in and one way out.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So he didn't
get through the gate,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't get through
past those technicians.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That must have
been really discombobulating

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.400 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Like, what-- after
that, then what--

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:90%
what was their conclusion?

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: They didn't know.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
What happened after they
searched his apartment, which

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:90%
was off base in Tacoma.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:90%
And they took his car and they--

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I believe they took
that to the FBI office,

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and they basically
took it apart to see

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.770 align:middle line:84%
if there was anything in
there that would maybe

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:90%
indicate he was a spy.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.290 align:middle line:90%
He was committing espionage.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.580 align:middle line:84%
He maybe tried to take something
out of the storage area.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Another thing they did was
they did an immediate inventory

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:84%
of everything
classified, the tools,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
the documents, the
restricted data manuals

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:84%
for that particular
weapon system.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:84%
They want to make sure nothing
was missing out of that

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and there wasn't
anything missing.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Everything was accounted for.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:90%
So now they have a dilemma.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.190 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Where did this guy go?

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So, OSI-- the base OSI
immediately turned us over

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.210 align:middle line:90%
to special projects OSI.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
They did the super
secret and the--

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.330 align:middle line:84%
we call it abnormal
investigations such as UFOs

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But they were still
concerned that he escaped,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.270 align:middle line:84%
figured out how to do
this because he was a spy.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So then he started an
espionage investigation,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.530 align:middle line:90%
and that lasted for a good year.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, my.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: But at the end--

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.642 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Still nothing.

00:10:20.642 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Still nothing.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So he disappeared
in this flash of light.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, were any of the
other technicians affected

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:90%
by this light in any way?

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, after
the interview with OSI,

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:35.030 align:middle line:84%
these four technicians were
transported to the Army Madigan

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
General Hospital, which
is next to McChord.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
They were transported
over there,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and they were fully
examined for radiation,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:84%
for any other type of
injuries or illnesses

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:90%
and they all passed.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
They didn't-- they weren't
suffering from any radiation

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:84%
sickness or any other illnesses
or medical conditions.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So they were pretty
much cleared,

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:84%
with the exception of the
fact that they were upset

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and psychologically traumatized
by what they witnessed

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
their Lieutenant, their boss,
their supervisor, who they had

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:84%
a relationship with because
he was their supervisor,

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
had disappeared in
a flash of a light.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't
understand that,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
nor could anyone
else at that point.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were there any
specific claims on the duration

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:90%
of his absence?

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, here's
the strange part of it.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Five years later, exactly five
years later, August 11, 1975,

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
a security policeman
was walking a perimeter

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and he sees this person
walking towards him

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:90%
and this person had a badge on.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:84%
He was in an Air Force uniform,
displaying first Lieutenant

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:84%
bars, an Air Force
utility uniform.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately
challenged that person.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And this person was, as the
security policeman related

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:90%
later, was in a daze.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.120 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know where he was.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So when the security
policeman walked up to him,

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:84%
challenging him with an M16
pointing at Lieutenant Anderson,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.470 align:middle line:84%
he noticed that he
did have a badge on.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So as a security policeman
looked at that badge,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.020 align:middle line:84%
that badge was an old
badge that expired

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:90%
in 1973, two years earlier.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So he immediately took
Lieutenant Anderson in custody,

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:84%
turned him around
and took him back

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.990 align:middle line:84%
to the main gate area of
the weapons storage area.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the five
years that had passed,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.660 align:middle line:84%
the nuclear weapons
storage area had changed.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.000 align:middle line:84%
They'd put-- they
reconstructed the perimeter.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
They reconstructed
the main gate area.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:90%
They call it the Sally port.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.180 align:middle line:90%
As you come in, one gate closes.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So you're trapped in
one area until you're

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:90%
cleared to get through.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's a new-- that
was a new facility.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.260 align:middle line:84%
It was built in the five
years since his disappearance.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:84%
When he walked-- when the
security policeman walked him up

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
to the front area, notifying his
supervisor who was a security

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.380 align:middle line:90%
police master sergeant--

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I found this guy in
there, and he's not

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:84%
on the entry control log and
he has a badge that expired.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
he got in there.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.870 align:middle line:84%
There was a senior master
sergeant at nuclear weapons

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:90%
technician that recognized him.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.892 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's
Lieutenant Anderson.

00:13:23.892 --> 00:13:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, goodness.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And so they-- of
course, the security policeman,

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.535 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know who
Lieutenant Anderson was.

00:13:30.535 --> 00:13:31.335 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:31.335 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:90%
How did he get in here?

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, the senior
master didn't know.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't know,
but he used to work here.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:90%
He disappeared five years ago.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was he found on
the outside of the perimeter

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.520 align:middle line:90%
of the base or on the inside?

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He was
found in the inside.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Meaning he had to get
through three layers of security

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:90%
to get in there.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.265 align:middle line:90%
So nobody saw beam of light.

00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:52.640 align:middle line:84%
The security
policeman that found

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.393 align:middle line:84%
him, the first thing
they asked him was--

00:13:54.393 --> 00:13:55.560 align:middle line:90%
did you see a beam of light?

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.477 align:middle line:90%
Did you see-- nothing.

00:13:56.477 --> 00:13:59.420 align:middle line:84%
He just-- I just saw him
walking up towards me

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:90%
and he was in a daze.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.960 align:middle line:90%
He seemed like he was out of it.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.360 align:middle line:90%
His eyes weren't focusing on me.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:84%
That's when he brought
him-- they brought him up

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:90%
to the front.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Now they have a dilemma.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.930 align:middle line:84%
How did this-- how did this guy
who had been missing five years

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.800 align:middle line:84%
end up in the same area
that he disappeared from?

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Well, is he talking?

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Is he saying, hey,
guys or anything?

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He didn't say a word
until the medical personnel got

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:90%
He seemed like he was out of it.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.630 align:middle line:90%
So they called the ambulance.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But the security police
maintain custody of him.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
He was transported to the
local clinic at that--

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and five years later, the Air
Force had a bigger clinic there.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:84%
In 1970, they had
a little clinic,

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:84%
but anyway, they transported him
to the clinic to be examined,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor in the
emergency room of the clinic

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:84%
said he is suffering
from a traumatic episode,

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and he can't understand exactly
what because Lieutenant Anderson

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been able to talk.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:90%
He hadn't said a word.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't get anything
out of him other than he's--

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and plus, one of the things that
which was somewhat ironic when

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:84%
he took him into
the clinic, he's

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:84%
in an Air Force
uniform with a security

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:20.010 align:middle line:84%
badge, and he has
an ID card on him.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:84%
His ID card had expired
a couple of years before.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying we can't find
any medical records on this guy.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:84%
This guy is assigned
to this base,

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and the senior Master Sergeant
who was with him at the time,

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:84%
along with the security police,
as saying he was five years ago,

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:90%
but he disappeared.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can imagine
trying to explain

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:84%
all this to a doctor, a
captain, Air Force captain, who

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.530 align:middle line:84%
was a doctor, and he was trying
to make sense of all this

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.113 align:middle line:84%
and nobody was making
any sense of it.

00:15:50.113 --> 00:15:50.913 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No.

00:15:50.913 --> 00:15:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So anyways, the
doctor examined him and said

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
he's suffered some
kind of trauma--

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:84%
all I can say, because
he's not talking.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So then he was transported
over to the OSI office.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.705 align:middle line:84%
Now, the OSI, none of the agents
that had been there in 1970

00:16:06.705 --> 00:16:07.830 align:middle line:90%
were still stationed there.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So these are all
brand new agents.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:90%
All new agents.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So the senior Master
Sergeant explained to these--

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.240 align:middle line:84%
to the two agents exactly
what had happened.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So then they had to get
in there-- the records

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and find the file and
the case and so forth.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And they realized-- now,
at McChord Air Force Base,

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:84%
there were two OSI units
there was a district,

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.280 align:middle line:84%
a District 20, which
covered a large area,

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:84%
was the district
headquarters, and then

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.620 align:middle line:84%
they had a base
investigative detachment

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.650 align:middle line:84%
or the OSI agents that
investigated everything

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:90%
on the base.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:84%
They decided to contact the
district headquarters, which

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
was some distance away,
a few blocks away,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and contact the special
projects people.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was an agent
still there working

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:90%
in the special projects.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
He had gone and came
back, but he said,

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:90%
you got to be kidding me.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.240 align:middle line:90%
You got Lieutenant Anderson?

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.839 align:middle line:90%
So he went over there.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
The first thing they did was
they took his fingerprints.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:84%
They had to verify the
fact that this guy was,

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:13.240 align:middle line:84%
in fact, Lieutenant Anderson,
because he's gone five years.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:90%
He shows up in the storage area.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:90%
Where the heck has he been?

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Is this really him?

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Is he in another
body I mean, they

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.040 align:middle line:84%
were thinking of all
these other things.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.970 align:middle line:84%
They took his
fingerprints, matched.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So then they started talking to
him, and eventually he opened up

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.850 align:middle line:90%
and he told his story.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What did he
reveal to the OSI agents?

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He said that he
remembers being inside.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing that
really confused everyone.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Anderson didn't
realize he was gone.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Five years.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:84%
He said I was walking over
to a toolbox to get a tool,

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.218 align:middle line:84%
and he named the
airman first class

00:17:53.218 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:90%
that he was getting a tool for.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And he said, and
suddenly, I blacked out,

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and I find myself floating,
and then I'm in some kind

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:90%
of container, a round container.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And I felt really dizzy because
it felt like I was spinning.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know,
I'm on this rectangle table.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:90%
I was completely nude.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around and I
see these beings These--

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:90%
he called them humanoids.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.250 align:middle line:84%
He said they weren't
more than 4 to--

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.160 align:middle line:90%
4 and 1/2 to 5 feet tall.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.630 align:middle line:90%
They have large heads.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.450 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any ears.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:84%
They had large eyes, slits for
nose, a small slit for a mouth,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.208 align:middle line:84%
and large fingers,
but no thumbs.

00:18:43.208 --> 00:18:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What color were they?

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: They were gray.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Dark gray in color.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.070 align:middle line:84%
He said what he noticed was
there was a platform that some

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.270 align:middle line:84%
of them were on that
were walking down,

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and he noticed that their arms
were proportionately longer

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.090 align:middle line:90%
than they should be.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Their arms reach down
to the mid calves.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And he thought at first
they were monkeys,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and he couldn't figure
out where he was.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And he started talking.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:90%
He asked him, where am I?

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, he
didn't hear any voices

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.410 align:middle line:84%
except in his head,
and his voices

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:90%
kept telling him to calm down.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:90%
You're not being harmed.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:90%
We will not hurt you.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
But over a period of
time-- and he doesn't know.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have any
way to gauge time.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:90%
They examined him.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:90%
He said, from head to toe.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were spending
a lot of time examining him,

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:90%
poking him.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:84%
They had instruments
that were over his face.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:84%
They had things that
went into his eyes.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:84%
They had two-- he had a gadget
that went into his nose,

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:90%
but he didn't feel any pain.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.470 align:middle line:90%
He never felt any pain.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And then he felt
pain in his foot.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that they had
taken a toenail out of his foot.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.160 align:middle line:90%
But there was no blood.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Then he felt dizzy again.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And then he found
himself in a chair,

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:02.180 align:middle line:84%
a metal chair with a big brace
over him so he couldn't move.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was looking
around and all he sees

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
are these beings,
these humanoids.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't talking
to him in a voice.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.070 align:middle line:84%
They were talking to
him through his head.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And they started asking
all these questions

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.000 align:middle line:90%
about what he did.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And they kept talking about the
destructive metal containers.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.753 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And he didn't
understand at first--

00:20:23.753 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:90%
what are you talking about?

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:90%
And he's talking in a voice.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.050 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to be
understanding him,

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
responding in a voice,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:90%
they're responding to his head.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:84%
He kept asking them I don't
know what you're talking about.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.940 align:middle line:90%
What metal containers?

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And they said the destructive
metal containers that you make.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And then he
realized, oh, they're

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.100 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
nuclear weapons.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And then he asked them,
are you talking about nuclear

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:90%
weapons?

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:84%
They didn't seem to know what
that was which was odd to him.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And he kept asking
them, where am I?

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And they were responding in
his head, you're with us,

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:90%
you're safe.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And so over a period
of time, and he

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.925 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know how much time,
they kept asking him questions.

00:21:09.925 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Finally, he said, I'm not going
to answer any of your questions

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:90%
I can't talk about that.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who you
are and you ask me

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:90%
questions that are classified.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:84%
They didn't seem to understand
what he was talking about.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:84%
The next thing he knew that
there was this big metal

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:90%
ring that came over his head.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And when it came over his
head, he couldn't see.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.700 align:middle line:90%
It was like he went blind.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And then he started feeling
strange pulses, almost

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.920 align:middle line:84%
like electrical
pulses in his brain.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And then he started seeing
things, all these strange things

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.390 align:middle line:90%
in his eyes.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.473 align:middle line:84%
But he had his eyes open,
he said, but he couldn't

00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:90%
see except for these strange--

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:50.940 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:84%
A strange appearances
in front of his eyes.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Illusions, he called them.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and he didn't know
how long this was happening.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
this ring came over--

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.640 align:middle line:84%
came back-- went up above his
head and he could see again.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.132 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized,
ah-- now, he's so smart.

00:22:09.132 --> 00:22:10.590 align:middle line:84%
He's a Lieutenant
in the Air Force.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:90%
He went to college.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He had
some intelligence.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.820 align:middle line:84%
He-- then he realized
they just read my mind.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized that
these things were not humans.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:84%
They were probably
from another planet,

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and he's probably
at that planet.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So then they took him
into another room,

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:90%
and it was like another ball.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.650 align:middle line:84%
But he saw a lot
of these beings,

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:90%
humanoids all around him.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:41.292 align:middle line:84%
It was like an
amphitheater, he called it.

00:22:41.292 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:90%
But one was in front of him.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.130 align:middle line:84%
This one in front of him didn't
look like the other ones.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:49.920 align:middle line:90%
It had an almost a human face.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said it had ears
and nose, a mouth and eyes.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:84%
He said it looked almost human,
but when it brought its hands

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:90%
up, he noticed that the hands--

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:84%
the digits were the
same as the other ones,

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
although this particular
humanoid was bigger.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.750 align:middle line:84%
But this humanoid spoke
English and started

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:16.600 align:middle line:84%
asking all these questions over
and over and over and over.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.982 align:middle line:84%
And then he wasn't
answering these questions--

00:23:18.982 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: The same questions.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The same question
over and over and over.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:90%
What were you doing?

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.740 align:middle line:84%
How do you make these
destructive devices?

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Why do you make these
destructive devices?

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.210 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm not talking to you.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Then this humanoid stood up
and got really close to him

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and said, you cannot
deceive us anymore.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.870 align:middle line:90%
You cannot deceive us anymore.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So then he figures he has
no choice but to tell him

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.740 align:middle line:90%
everything they wanted to know.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:90%
So he did.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And then after he told him,
these other humanoids that

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle line:84%
were sitting in this, like,
amphitheater disappeared.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Now he's
in there by himself,

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and he feels himself
being floating.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like he was
floating up in the air

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and down back on a table,
up in the air and back down

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:09.810 align:middle line:90%
on the table.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't figure out
if he was in something

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:16.710 align:middle line:84%
that was moving, causing
him to be jerked around

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.670 align:middle line:90%
and then he went to sleep.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And then he woke up and he was
inside the weapons storage area.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: He says, I figured--

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:84%
when I woke, I was dazed and
I couldn't focus my eyes.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.690 align:middle line:84%
It took me some time
to focus my eyes.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, I remember the
security policeman talking to me

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to
respond, but I couldn't.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, well,
how did I just get out

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.230 align:middle line:90%
of the maintenance building?

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.952 align:middle line:84%
I'm out here in the middle
of the storage area.

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And that all happened
and now he's been gone five

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:90%
years?

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He's been
gone five years.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And so when he goes--
when he makes it back,

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:84%
he's trying to
talk, but he can't.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to
tell him, let me go back

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:90%
into the maintenance building.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And when he went
to the hospital,

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:10.770 align:middle line:84%
the doctor is talking
to him and he looked up

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.660 align:middle line:84%
beyond the doctor in his
calendar in the wall.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And now anybody who's
been in the military,

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:84%
you know that there's
this calendar system.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:84%
You have three different
calendars-- the month

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.490 align:middle line:84%
before, the current month
and the month after.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at a circle and
he noticed it was August 11.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Then he looked at the
year and it was 1975.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.585 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:25:32.585 --> 00:25:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He became very
disgruntled, scared.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.770 align:middle line:90%
He said, it can't be 19--

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:41.210 align:middle line:90%
1975.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a dream.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And then
eventually he did--

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
he said-- he spoke to
the doctor, saying,

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm in a dream
because it can't be 1975.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.860 align:middle line:84%
The moment we got
over to the OSI office

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and they started
questioning him,

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.632 align:middle line:84%
he said, I was in the
maintenance building

00:25:59.632 --> 00:26:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and I went to get a
tool and I don't know

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.450 align:middle line:90%
how I got out into the field.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:07.745 align:middle line:84%
But then he told the OSI
agents his story and--

00:26:07.745 --> 00:26:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How they
perceive that?

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, you got to stop
and think of the OSI agent.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, this particular
OSI agent had

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.740 align:middle line:90%
been there when this happened.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.893 align:middle line:90%
He interviewed--

00:26:18.893 --> 00:26:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's good.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The witnesses and
he knew that something had

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.700 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.280 align:middle line:84%
But the big question was
where was he for five years.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I couldn't have
been gone for five years.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Number one, I have
the same uniform on.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember sleeping
and I can't remember eating.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't have
been gone five years.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.160 align:middle line:90%
But he hadn't aged any.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So the dilemma for OSI and the
dilemma for the United States

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Air Force is where is--

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.880 align:middle line:84%
is this: We know
he worked there.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:84%
We know he was there
inside that igloo in 1970.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He shows
up five years later.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Where was he?

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did this impact
Lieutenant Anderson's life?

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.475 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They gave him
a medical discharge.

00:27:07.475 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:84%
He was sent to Sheppard Air
Force Base, the psychic--

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Air Force psychiatric hospital
at Wichita Falls, Texas.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And I'm sure
you know where that's at.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:16.940 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Went to school there.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And he was there
for like, 4 to 5 months.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And he went through
a psychological evaluation.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And they realized
that at some point,

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.850 align:middle line:84%
he can't remain
in the Air Force.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And so he was
medically discharged.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And he was medically
discharged in 1976.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was there any concerns
with OSI that maybe he was

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:84%
programmed when he got
back to do a mission?

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Absolutely.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
They were convinced and
they came to the conclusion

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.570 align:middle line:84%
that he had been abducted
by an extraterrestrial.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:84%
He probably went to some
kind of a time warp,

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.010 align:middle line:84%
getting from one
place to another.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.230 align:middle line:84%
The time period on Earth
went by five years.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.997 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: His time period was
just maybe a matter of hours or

00:28:04.997 --> 00:28:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: A couple hours--

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Maybe a few days.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Makes sense.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And that he was
probably programmed to do

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force Separation
Board, as you know,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:84%
they have to go through
this separation board--

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.730 align:middle line:90%
was all classified.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.620 align:middle line:84%
It was at Randolph
Air Force Base.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And they decided they can't
keep him in the Air Force

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.920 align:middle line:84%
because they can
never trust him.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No way.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So he was medically
discharged, and he was--

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:84%
all his medical care,
psychological care

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.020 align:middle line:84%
was turned over to the
Veterans Administration.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So was he monitored
after that and his private life

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:40.420 align:middle line:90%
because of what he went through?

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yes.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:84%
When I spoke with
him, he said he

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:84%
was visited for a number
of years periodically

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
and says he didn't
say it was routine.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But he said periodically
there would be two OSI agents.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Later on, he called them
intelligence officers

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that would come and
talk to him at his home.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He had to fill out
a form and mail it to the Air

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure where it
went every time he moved.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:84%
He ended up buying
a car dealership.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And he worked at
a car dealership.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Away from what he
had done in the Air Force.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think they probably--
although I saw him five years

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:90%
before he passed away.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:90%
He's passed away now.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But during the time I
interviewed him with the other

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:36.630 align:middle line:84%
OSI agent that had ran
this case back in the 70s,

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:41.440 align:middle line:84%
he told me that they stopped
seeing him several years before.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.260 align:middle line:84%
So he was up there
in age, and I'm

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:51.300 align:middle line:84%
sure because of what he went
through and what he told them,

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.367 align:middle line:84%
he could have easily
been programmed by them.

00:29:54.367 --> 00:29:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah, of course.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.542 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Because we didn't
know their technology.

00:29:57.542 --> 00:29:59.940 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what
the extraterrestrials

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.265 align:middle line:90%
were capable of doing.

00:30:01.265 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:84%
They could have
planted something

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:90%
in his body or his head.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: That if he went
back into the Air Force,

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.340 align:middle line:84%
maybe they were trying to steal
a nuclear weapon or something

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.280 align:middle line:90%
to that effect.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Rick, when you
last saw Lieutenant Anderson,

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.670 align:middle line:84%
did he mention anything
about any visits from

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:18.470 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials?

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.803 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: That's one of the
questions I asked him towards

00:30:20.803 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:90%
the end of the interview.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And this was a 5.5-hour
interview at a Holiday Inn.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I asked him, I said, did
these extraterrestrials

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.440 align:middle line:90%
come back to visit you?

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.640 align:middle line:90%
He said never.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:31.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:33.823 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He said for a
few years afterwards,

00:30:33.823 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:90%
he had some strange dreams.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is something he did,
which is kind of peculiar,

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.830 align:middle line:84%
but I can understand
why he did it.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:47.010 align:middle line:90%
He never got married.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And he had his own
reasons for that.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But when
he went to bed,

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.340 align:middle line:84%
he would strap
himself into the bed.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, my goodness.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Horrifying--

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And he eventually was
able to find something that

00:30:58.790 --> 00:30:59.590 align:middle line:90%
would strap--

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.620 align:middle line:90%
strap him in with a padlock.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Because he was afraid--

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That they're
going to come get him--

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: That they
were going to come.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:90%
He read a book.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:10.710 align:middle line:84%
He-- don't remember who the
author of, maybe Dr. Mack

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.690 align:middle line:90%
or somebody about abductions.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was afraid that they
would come back because he would

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.690 align:middle line:90%
have these strange dreams.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And these dreams were
very vivid to him.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:27.976 align:middle line:84%
And so he thought, well, I'm
going to strap myself into bed.

00:31:27.976 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But he can never remember
them coming back.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Rick, how was his
personal life affected by this

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:34.783 align:middle line:90%
five-year absence?

00:31:34.783 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, first of
all, when he got back,

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.170 align:middle line:90%
he came back after five years--

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He wanted to
contact his parents,

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.670 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't allow him to do
that because Air Force told his

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:50.910 align:middle line:84%
parents he was on a Special
Operations mission and he went

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:51.780 align:middle line:90%
missing.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.700 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Air
Force told his parents.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually,
after a few years,

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force told him
that he was missing

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and his body would
not be recovered.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Now, five years later,
his mother and father are still

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:12.270 align:middle line:84%
alive in Davenport, Iowa, and
the first thing he wanted to do

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.670 align:middle line:84%
was call his mom and say and
dad and say, I'm all right.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.880 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
tell him initially

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.100 align:middle line:84%
that they'd told his
parents that he was dead,

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.820 align:middle line:84%
but they told him that
you've been gone five years.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually, the
Air Force told his parents

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.090 align:middle line:84%
that he was
recovered and that he

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.620 align:middle line:84%
was in a hospital in
Wichita Falls, Texas.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Of course, his
parents came down.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.820 align:middle line:84%
He had a cover
story to tell them.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And he told them
that cover story

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that he was on a mission
in Southeast Asia.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember this
time the Vietnam

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:47.400 align:middle line:84%
War was going on during
this time period from 1970

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.120 align:middle line:90%
to about '75.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, I was
over in Southeast Asia

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.600 align:middle line:84%
on a classified
mission, and I was gone.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm back and I can't
explain to you what I did.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So that was a cover
story for his parents.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Rick, from the other
OSI files you've been engaged

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.800 align:middle line:84%
with, is there anything that
stands out that you've heard

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.160 align:middle line:84%
this before or that it's unique
in a way that's associated with

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:90%
another case?

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: There were some other
cases that involved missing

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.657 align:middle line:90%
time, but not five years.

00:33:20.657 --> 00:33:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Not five years, right.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I think the most that I know
about was a few months that I'd

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.420 align:middle line:84%
read somebody who was
abducted and they were gone.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:34.060 align:middle line:84%
They thought an hour, but they
were gone a few months, but not

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:34.860 align:middle line:90%
five years.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.850 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard that.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:36.683 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: All right.

00:33:36.683 --> 00:33:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a very fascinating
and compelling story.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Rick, thank you so much
for breaking that file out

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:43.512 align:middle line:84%
and sharing it with
us on the show.

00:33:43.512 --> 00:33:44.720 align:middle line:90%
