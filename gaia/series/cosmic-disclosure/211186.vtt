>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we're with Richard Doty,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:10%
a retired Special Agent who
served in the Air Force Office

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.920 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.005 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO,

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:31.820 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're discussing the
Monarch Park UFO incident.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us about the
Monarch UFO incident.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The Monarch UFO incident
happened some years ago.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a campground up
on top of Monarch Pass.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:84%
As a US Forest
Service campground,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.400 align:middle line:84%
place where people
frequently camp.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
There's two girls, Julie
and Joan, recent graduate

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:90%
of the University of Denver.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And they decided to go on a
camping trip for the weekend.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So they drove up to
Monarch campgrounds.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:90%
They planned this on the map.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:84%
They went in, found a nice
place, set up their tents,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and decided they
were going to spend

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful weekend in the
wild on top of Monarch Pass.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:90%
A cool temperature up there.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:90%
There's a spring.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:84%
They can go and
wade in the spring.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.708 align:middle line:84%
There's three different
lakes that they can fish at.

00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's a river
that passes through it.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.042 align:middle line:84%
The first night they
were there, they

00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
walked out on the
edge of the mountain

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
with a ski-- there was a
skiing resort up there.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Of course, this is summertime.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And they could look out
over the valley seeing

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:84%
the ski resort and a-- some
kind of communications antenna

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:90%
up there.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, what they didn't know was
there was a NORAD communication

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:90%
site on top of Monarch Mountain.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And NORAD used it as did other
Air Force planes used it.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Anyways, they walked out.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:90%
They sat in a nice area.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:90%
They had a blanket.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:84%
They had two cups
of hot chocolate.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
They had just made
some s'mores earlier.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:90%
They were just there to relax.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>> How beautiful.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>> How beautiful.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:90%
They're sitting there talking.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, they see
this light moving at them.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And they watch this light
and watch this light.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And they both commented to each
other, Julie to Joan and Joan

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:90%
to Julie, that's moving.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:90%
That must be an airplane.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:90%
And they watched it.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
The sun was just getting
ready to set to the west.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And they looked probably to
the south and saw this light.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And it got closer and
closer and closer and bigger

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:90%
and bigger and bigger.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:90%
Julie sat there.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Joan, who was on her right,
got scared and ran off.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
She says, I'm
getting out of here.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:84%
She ran back to her
campsite, which was

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:90%
a couple hundred yards away.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:90%
But Julie just sat there.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:90%
She didn't fear.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have any
fear in her mind.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.535 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this craft, a
flying saucer landed.

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:84%
The first thing she
thought in her mind

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:90%
was, oh, my god, these are real.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm just watching one
land right in front of me.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was right
in front of her.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Although it didn't make
much of a sound, it landed.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
She didn't hear engines
or anything like that.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:90%
And doors opened.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And two entities
walked out, humanoids.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:90%
They had helmets on.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:84%
They had silvery
suits, long arms.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Their arms were longer
proportionally than their body.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:90%
And they walked up to her.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And she heard
voices in her head.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And then she soon
realized they're

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:84%
talking to me in English
but through telepathy.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And so she was answering
them back but talking.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And they said, come
aboard our craft.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:84%
She was somewhat hesitant,
but she decided--

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:90%
she was always an adventurer.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:90%
So she decided, why not?

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:90%
So she went aboard the craft.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
The next thing she remembers
was being in this big room

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:84%
with a huge television
monitor in front of her.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And she was watching movies.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:84%
She was watching the Earth
in its infant stages.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And she thought, where am I?

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
Why am I-- why am I seeing this?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Volcanoes and eruptions
and molten lava flowing.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the scene would change
to forests, dinosaurs, and then

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:90%
cavemen, and then a city.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:84%
She said everything
appeared to be non-human.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in this--
all the people walking

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%
around had suits on
and breathing masks.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:90%
And they're living in this area.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.210 align:middle line:84%
There's buildings
broken over here.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
There's buildings
broken over here.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:90%
She said, what am I looking at?

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:90%
And she kept asking.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't see any of these
entities that had brought her

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:90%
aboard this craft.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.960 align:middle line:84%
She figured she probably
was aboard a craft.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
they're showing her this.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Is this in a 3D realm?

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Or is it like the
subconscious, is she dreaming?

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Initially, she told us
she thought she was dreaming.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
But everything was
so vivid to her,

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:84%
she realized that
she wasn't dreaming.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.650 align:middle line:84%
She was seeing something in
real time as she called it.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was three dimensional.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:90%
She was seeing it.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.220 align:middle line:90%
She watched the entire thing.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't know
how long it lasted.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:90%
But then it showed her.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It's showing her in college.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And she thought, how did they
take pictures of me in college?

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:90%
How do they know that I'm--

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and these are confusing
thoughts going through her mind.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So she never saw
any future events.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:84%
But she was thinking that
maybe, at some future date,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:84%
they would come in and
show her something else.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
But they never did, to
the best of my knowledge.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And then she closed
her eyes and some--

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.900 align:middle line:84%
she doesn't understand
how this happened.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But she closed her
eyes because she felt

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:90%
like she should just lay down.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:90%
And she closed her eyes.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't remember whether
she actually laid down

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:90%
or what happened.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And then she appeared
exactly where

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:84%
she had started from
outside, on the ground,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the
ground looking out.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.100 align:middle line:90%
But it was morning.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:84%
She realized it was cool,
a lot cooler than it was.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And she noticed that
the sun was over here,

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.220 align:middle line:84%
meaning coming up from the east
because she's looking south.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
So then she realized,
my god, I've

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:90%
been out here the whole night.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So she got up and
started walking away

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and she got down
towards the campsite

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's when these searchers
and Sheriff's deputies

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
were coming up towards her
and confronted her saying,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.450 align:middle line:90%
are you Julie?

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes, I'm Julie.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, we've been
looking for you all night.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.982 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
She says, I don't
know where I was.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.025 align:middle line:90%
I was over here.

00:07:31.025 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:90%
No, you weren't here.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.970 align:middle line:84%
We searched this whole
area several times,

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:90%
and we can't find you.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So it was a Chaffee
County sheriffs.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
deputies says, listen,

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:84%
we're going to take you in
to Salida, to a hospital

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.283 align:middle line:90%
and have you checked out.

00:07:47.283 --> 00:07:48.450 align:middle line:90%
She said, no, I don't know--

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm all right.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, we're going
to have you checked out.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
where's Joan, my friend?

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, she left.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.848 align:middle line:90%
You disappeared.

00:07:57.848 --> 00:08:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, they took her to a
hospital, had her checked out.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:84%
They didn't find
anything wrong with her.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:84%
They go back her-- and she
meets back up with Joan.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.895 align:middle line:90%
They go back.

00:08:06.895 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
spend another night.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.920 align:middle line:84%
But Joan said, I'm not going
to spend another night here.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.915 align:middle line:84%
I spent a night in
a hotel because I

00:08:12.915 --> 00:08:14.040 align:middle line:90%
didn't know where you were.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:90%
You disappeared.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
wrong with you.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's just pack up.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:90%
And left they did.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:90%
They went back home in Denver.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
A few days later, OSI, the
Chaffee County Sheriff's

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:90%
deputies--

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.090 align:middle line:84%
listen, she told them
the entire story.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they did a report, and
they turned it over to the OSI

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:84%
at Air Force, OSI District 14,
which is at Laughlin Air Force

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Base at the time.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:90%
OSI agents took the case.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.280 align:middle line:84%
They later went and
interviewed her,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.330 align:middle line:84%
talked to her in
great lengths, wanted

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:90%
to know exactly what happened.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:90%
She told them the whole story.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.410 align:middle line:84%
She says, I'm not
lying about anything.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
these things were.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why they picked me.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And they put me in a ship,
and they show me these things.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why they
showed me these things.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:84%
What difference would
it made for them

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
to showing me the
history of Earth?

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And she's a college
educated woman.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Somewhat-- she's intelligent.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And she says, they showed me the
history of Earth right up to me

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:90%
in college.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Why did they do that to me?

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.305 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:09:21.305 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- why did
I-- why did they do that?

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.440 align:middle line:84%
The OSI agent said, well,
maybe because you are

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:90%
connected to them in some way.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And that starts the case
of her being different.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> What else did she
learn from the ETs?

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one thing I didn't talk
about was they gave her this

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
small box, this real
small metal box.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.890 align:middle line:84%
It was just a piece
of metal, she thought.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Had an inscription
on it, which was a--

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.790 align:middle line:84%
she called it hieroglyphic,
but it was actually

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:90%
a character on it.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.360 align:middle line:90%
It didn't open.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a piece of metal that
she didn't think much of it

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:84%
When OSI agents ask her for
this, though they asked her,

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:90%
did they give you anything?

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh by the way, they
gave me this piece of metal.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we're
going to confiscate this

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:90%
because it's radioactive.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.028 align:middle line:90%
And so they did.

00:10:15.028 --> 00:10:16.445 align:middle line:84%
But not because
it's radioactive--

00:10:16.445 --> 00:10:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, no.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>> --for other reasons.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever find out
anything about that artifact?

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they know what
kind of metal it was?

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It had some zinc in it.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But the way it's made,
it would be impossible

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.400 align:middle line:84%
for us to incorporate
zinc into something that's

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:90%
made of some other materials.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And what they found out--
and this is some time later--

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:84%
they found out that this
was a communications device.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
It was a tracking, more
or less a tracking device.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like a GPS
placed on somebody.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
They knew where she
was at all times.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.290 align:middle line:90%
But unfortunately, we took it.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.480 align:middle line:84%
They thought she would keep with
her where they could track her.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And at least that's the thought,
the mentality that we had,

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.415 align:middle line:84%
the idea or the theory we
had, that this was something

00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
to track her with.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, they
eventually got her

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:84%
into a different environment,
brought her down to us

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:84%
down in Albuquerque,
at Kirtland,

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:90%
where we took over this case.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And our goal was to find her
being somewhat similar to Cady.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And we interviewed her
over and over again.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:84%
She was not as receptive
to a normal interview

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
as Cady Smith was or others
that we've dealt with.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:90%
She was more hostile.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:41.883 align:middle line:90%
>> And not--

00:11:41.883 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was bothering
her that she was there,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:84%
that she had to go through
this with you guys.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was all volunteer.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:84%
We told her, you
don't have to do this,

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:90%
but we think you're different.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.350 align:middle line:90%
We think that you might--

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you had the experience.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:90%
You saw these ETs.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.910 align:middle line:84%
We can tell you what
happened to you is real.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, you want to know
why this happened?

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do, she kept saying.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.737 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to
cooperate with us.

00:12:05.737 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
You have to answer
all these questions

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:84%
that we're asking you
because initially, she

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:90%
gave us information.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:84%
But she was restrictive of
what she was saying because she

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:84%
was somewhat scared, I
think, of the results,

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
number one, and
why she was picked,

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and number two, of us,
of US intelligence--

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.882 align:middle line:90%
>> --confronting her.

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And were you telling her,
please don't tell anyone about

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:90%
this, don't go to the media?

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.723 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything
like that that maybe

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:90%
made her feel uncomfortable?

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we did do-- we
did do all those things.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And we did do things
to check on her.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:90%
And we did do--

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.833 align:middle line:84%
we call them offensive
operations to--

00:12:49.833 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The due diligence to
spy on someone without

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:90%
their permission.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:90%
A good way to put it.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:84%
To make sure she wasn't
somebody hostile--

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, of course.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Rule out--

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>> --Soviet intelligence
officer or something like that.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Or whether she was
just fooling everybody.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So anyways, we get her
to-- we pay for her to fly

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:90%
to Albuquerque.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And she's there the first day
in our controlled and secured

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.015 align:middle line:84%
And we're asking
these questions.

00:13:19.015 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And she's really not
really responding to much.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And then finally,
I said, listen to me.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:90%
You've got two options.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.970 align:middle line:84%
You can get up and
walk out of here.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:84%
We'll fly you back, and
you can forget this.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.708 align:middle line:84%
But I guarantee you, you're
going to be contacted again.

00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
be in the unknown

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:90%
just like you are right now.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:90%
Let us help you.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Let us try to find out
what happened to you,

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and we can determine what course
we can take to maybe prevent

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.110 align:middle line:90%
this from happening again.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.962 align:middle line:84%
Not that I knew that it would
ever happen, but that sounded--

00:13:51.962 --> 00:13:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, you made me
feel so comfortable,

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.253 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
tell you everything.

00:13:55.253 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] It sounded good.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And so she finally
eventually said--

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:84%
she made some phone
calls to her mother

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.210 align:middle line:90%
and to some other person.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the meantime, we had
interviewed Joan over and over.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't see anything.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>> She just left.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And finally, she
said, OK, I'll talk.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So she opened up totally,
this entire story,

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
agreed to be placed
under hypnosis,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:90%
and we did all those tests.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, we find
that she's got DNA, alien DNA.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Our consensus was
that she's a hybrid.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say
they have alien DNA,

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:84%
does that mean that you can
decipher what type of species

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:35.310 align:middle line:90%
it is?

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> To the best of my knowledge,
is when the government

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.110 align:middle line:84%
determined that you
have alien DNA in you,

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:84%
that just means that your DNA
was mixed with some alien DNA.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that--

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure now, they can
determine what species of--

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:84%
because we know
seven of them now--

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>> --which species of ET.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I was never briefed
in any program where

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:84%
they could determine
exactly the amount of DNA,

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
if that's feasible,
or the species of ET.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.190 align:middle line:84%
But there were other factors,
as I talked about before,

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:19.080 align:middle line:84%
where our experts can determine,
by brain patterns and thought

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:25.950 align:middle line:84%
patterns and so forth, we can
compare hers, with other known

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:84%
ET hybrids and determine
that she was, in fact, had

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.800 align:middle line:90%
some form of ET in her.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And we confronted her
with it and she and then

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
opened up that she felt
strange all her life.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:84%
She told us, well,
she was adopted.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Her mother and father,
at an early age,

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.940 align:middle line:84%
decided they didn't
want children

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.800 align:middle line:90%
and gave her up for adoption.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of her relatives or
aunt, her mother's sister,

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:59.170 align:middle line:84%
took her in, adopted
her, and she raised her.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have a father
in her life, just her aunt.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.110 align:middle line:90%
But it became her mother.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was kind of
awkward because she

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.400 align:middle line:84%
knew it was her aunt, but
she always called her mother.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:90%
So she felt different all along.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Although she was well
taken care of, well cared

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:84%
for during her life, growing
up, she always had everything,

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:84%
but she felt different
because she would meet people,

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and she would
immediately hate them.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Not dislike them, she
would hate these people

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.090 align:middle line:84%
because they were thinking
differently than she did.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, she never outwardly showed
this dissatisfaction or anger

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
towards this person, but
she wouldn't have anything

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.030 align:middle line:90%
to do with them.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Growing up in
school, she remembers

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.510 align:middle line:84%
she told us a story
about her sixth grade.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.090 align:middle line:84%
She went to sixth
grade, she sat.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.660 align:middle line:84%
First day of school of sixth
grade, she came in, sat down,

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.190 align:middle line:90%
and they all had assigned seats.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:90%
And she looks over.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
girl next to her.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.180 align:middle line:90%
And she hated this girl.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.690 align:middle line:84%
She looked over at her
and can't stand this girl.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, normal people don't act
that way, and she knew that.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:84%
She said, I shouldn't
hate this person.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:84%
But she starts
looking at this person

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and realizing this person is
thinking things differently.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But at as a sixth grader,
she doesn't understand

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:90%
why her mind is doing this.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.970 align:middle line:84%
But she is telling
these different stories.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number of other
stories she told us about--

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> She became aware of it.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Becoming aware of.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:84%
In college, she took
psychology courses.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And she realizes that
she wasn't normal.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>> And it was scary to her.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:37.870 align:middle line:90%
She goes, I don't--

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm crazy,
but I can read people.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't know
how to handle it.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we confronted
her with this,

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
then she realizes
what's wrong with her.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.520 align:middle line:84%
She never doubted what
we were telling her.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle line:84%
She never said,
no, I'm not alien.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:84%
She accepted it more
so than most people.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Initially, she was so against
us interviewing her, hostile.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:90%
And now, she was on our side.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:90%
I want to know more.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> How old was
she at that point?

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Twenty--, 24, 25, maybe 26.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.617 align:middle line:90%
And so she wanted to know more.

00:18:15.617 --> 00:18:16.450 align:middle line:90%
I want to know more.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:90%
I want you to help me.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll do what you want.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what you need to do.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll take this test.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:90%
I'll take that test.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So we recruited her
into this program.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And not only did we recruit
her into the program

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%
to assist us in finding
other people like hers,

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.410 align:middle line:84%
we want to know these
people you hate.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.420 align:middle line:84%
If you walk up to a person,
you instantly hate that person,

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:84%
we want to know
who that person is.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Is it hostile
intelligence or what?

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.925 align:middle line:84%
>> What was that
deciding factor?

00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, what's the deciding
factor in determining why you

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.440 align:middle line:84%
hate this person that you're
sitting next to in sixth grade

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:90%
class?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Or this guy you walking down
the street, and he walks by you.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
him, you hate him.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's all sorts
of different stories.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:90%
So I said, we'll recruit you.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.300 align:middle line:90%
So she said, OK.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I got college degree, can
I come into the Air Force?

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So she went
into the Air Force.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:90%
And she passed everything.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:90%
We got her into OSI.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.960 align:middle line:90%
She excelled magnificently.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, these people
with this hybrid system

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
in them or alien DNA excels
in so many different things,

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.840 align:middle line:90%
including languages.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.410 align:middle line:84%
She immediately grasped
the Turkish language.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:84%
She served a tour in
Turkey, fluent Turkish.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.770 align:middle line:84%
She came back and learned
some other languages, German

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and I believe, Japanese-- no,
Korean, stationed in Korea.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.070 align:middle line:84%
She excelled to the rank
of major in the OSI.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.200 align:middle line:90%
She retired.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
She works for another
intelligence agency.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And--

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.675 align:middle line:90%
>> What intelligence agency?

00:20:01.675 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, another one.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:06.270 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Another one that
she'd had working relationships

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:90%
with while she was OSI agent.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And did she have this ongoing
relationship with the ETs

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:90%
throughout her OSI career?

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, here's the interesting
part I was going to leave

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:90%
for last.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I had told her that you're
probably going to be revisited.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these things
don't only visit you once.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like Cady Smith, where
these things were following her

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:84%
I said they're probably going
to come and contact you.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And she accepted that.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:90%
She said, OK, I accepted it.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So for the first couple of years
she was in, nothing happened.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, she's in an
operation at another location

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:90%
and outside the United States.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:90%
And she leaves to go.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle line:90%
It was a night operation.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.048 align:middle line:90%
She leaves this facility.

00:20:52.048 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- I
don't remember, it's

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.730 align:middle line:84%
a hotel or what, to go and
get in a vehicle to drive out.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And as she exited the
hotel, the craft lands.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And these two-- and
this is years later,

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:90%
the same two that--

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The abducted-- or she had
contact with on Monarch Pass

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:84%
back in the '80s is there
again to meet with her.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And how did she know
it was the same two?

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>> She just recognized--

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, she recognized them.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>> --the voices.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Telepathy.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what kind they were?

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, she didn't identify
them fully as the Greys,

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
but we have strong indications
that they were the Greys.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So they were the Greys
that had contacted her.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things
we knew about the Greys,

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:84%
there's kind of a side
note, is sometimes,

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.080 align:middle line:90%
they disguise themselves.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they'll wear a
helmet, a suit, a spacesuit

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:84%
to more or less
appease the person

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
that they're abducting
or contacting,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily
because they have to.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that in the case
of Julie, that's what happened.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:90%
And they came back.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
make contact with her.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this isn't
really a good time.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm going out.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
we'll help you.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Amicable kind
of agreement there.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.570 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:90%
They assisted her.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't involved
in any of that.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Did she report to
you guys right away,

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.720 align:middle line:90%
or was there a delay?

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
When did you find out about
that, that there was assistance

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:84%
from an extraterrestrial
race on a highly

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:90%
government-classified mission?

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, she went
on the mission.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.330 align:middle line:90%
And apparently, with these--

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:84%
her friends with her and not
visual, and it was completed.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
successful mission.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Had nothing to do with
UFOs, more or less

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:84%
had to do with an
espionage operation.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And when she got back to
the staging area, which was,

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe, a civilian
police station,

00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:01.160 align:middle line:84%
she told her supervisor, I
believe, he was a GM-14--

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was GM-14
because he was also

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:90%
my supervisor at one time.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:90%
And she told him what happened.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:90%
And he said, great.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, we got backup.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.252 align:middle line:84%
Now, we got friends
here to help you.

00:23:12.252 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was a report they
probably had to file as well,

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.040 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:84%
They had to do a
report and so forth.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:90%
She did a report.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:90%
And she told her--

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is real time
because it just happened.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And after this
operation is over,

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.820 align:middle line:84%
well, she tells her
supervisor what happened.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And so of course, she does
a report, he does a report.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, they know that she has
these contacts with this ET

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.990 align:middle line:90%
race.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Did OSI, when
they found out this,

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:84%
did you immediately take her
off from her job duty and do

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.348 align:middle line:90%
additional testing?

00:23:44.348 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not aware of that.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Or you guys kind of
already knew that she was

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.690 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial?

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Was that a concern for you?

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.485 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what we're looking at
here are two different things,

00:23:52.485 --> 00:23:53.285 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:23:53.285 --> 00:23:57.060 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at, OK, she
has alien DNA in her, OK.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.560 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people have alien DNA.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.700 align:middle line:90%
They found out.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.050 align:middle line:84%
We're more concerned
with them, her friends,

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:84%
controlling her than her
having alien DNA in her.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I think, the consensus, at
least to the one supervisor

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with,
they're not worried

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.580 align:middle line:84%
about her being disloyal to
the United States or anything

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.670 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:23.640 align:middle line:84%
They're worrying about,
can the ETs manipulate her?

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Not the fact that she has the
alien DNA in her but will they,

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and will they interfere
with something?

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, say for instance that--

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:37.170 align:middle line:84%
example would be she's on a
very secretive mission, where

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.050 align:middle line:84%
she has to break into some
place and do something.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And the ETs are with her, and
they don't want her to do that.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Or she gets into a confrontation
with a hostile intelligence

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.830 align:middle line:90%
service.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:90%
And she pulls her gun out.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, she has to shoot.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to stop
her from being hostile?

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things
that I would think about.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:90%
She's--

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Not be able to shoot and
defend herself or defend me

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.140 align:middle line:84%
or another agent
or other people.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:84%
That's something I
would think about.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
interfere with us?

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they know
everything that she knows.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what's scary.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, she was loyal
during her entire time.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And what we talked about, what
I would have been afraid of,

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure some
of the supervisors

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:84%
would have been afraid
of never materialized,

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that she was able to perform
her mission in a great manner

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:90%
during her career.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the most outstanding
thing that you got from

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:84%
your professional
relationship with Julie?

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> She had the outstanding
ability to project the future.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we
were in an operation,

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:90%
and we were following a vehicle.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And the only way this
operation would have proceeded

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:84%
to where we wanted it
to was for that vehicle

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:90%
to make a right turn.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:84%
She projected in her
mind for that vehicle

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.370 align:middle line:90%
to make a right turn.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And the vehicle
made a right turn.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.210 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
talking about when

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I said she can project
something in the future.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were other
facets of this operation

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:23.310 align:middle line:84%
that she was projecting the
bad guy to do this, the target

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:90%
to do this and this.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:90%
And he did those things.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Whether she put that in his mind
to do it or however she did it,

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how she did it.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:84%
That was the only
operation I saw.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:39.630 align:middle line:84%
But over the years, I've
spoken to other agents

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.320 align:middle line:84%
who told me that
she was phenomenal

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:90%
in projecting a future event.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you learn from her
what the ETs were doing with

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:90%
humankind?

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things that
they, her friends, these Greys.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Instilled upon her was that
she wasn't the only one.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:04.060 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't the only human
that was in her position.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And they readily admitted to
her, more so than Cady Smith,

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:16.270 align:middle line:84%
but they readily admitted to
her that they manufactured her.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:84%
They said it in a way that
she had interpreted to me,

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.280 align:middle line:90%
they built me.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm theirs.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:84%
She interpreted that to
mean that their DNA was

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:90%
mixed with her DNA or human DNA.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.565 align:middle line:84%
Now, she didn't understand if
that happened on their planet,

00:27:33.565 --> 00:27:36.168 align:middle line:90%
if she was brought here.

00:27:36.168 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:90%
She didn't understand it.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.353 align:middle line:84%
And to the best
of my knowledge, I

00:27:39.353 --> 00:27:41.020 align:middle line:84%
don't think I ever
had that information.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:90%
But we have others.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:84%
You're just one of many which
kind of scared her in a way.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And not only did this scare
her, scared the OSI agents

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that she was working with,
there were many others.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Has OSI been infiltrated by--

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>> --by the Greys.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>> --by the aliens, yeah.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And then later on,
when the DNA came out,

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.020 align:middle line:90%
she went through all that.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was determined
that she had alien DNA.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
person we might

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:18.445 align:middle line:84%
need to bring on
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:28:18.445 --> 00:28:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that would be great.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:90%
What a compelling story, Rick.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you again
for being on the show.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my pleasure, Emery.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.050 align:middle line:90%
