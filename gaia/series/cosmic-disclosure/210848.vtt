00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.500 align:middle line:10%
a retired counterintelligence
agent who served in the Air

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:10%
Force Office of
Special Investigations.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Tim.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>> You served on the infamous
military base Area 51.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Most people, in
living their lives,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
they assume the technology
we see on the television

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and the mainstream media, this
is state-of-the-art technology.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:84%
What other
technologies are there

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:84%
which we don't see
publicly on television?

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the jobs
I had at Area 51,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Air Force Flight Test Center,
dealt with the protection

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.800 align:middle line:90%
of special access programs.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:84%
I was assigned, within the Air
Force of Special Investigations

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to a special projects
branch, and our job

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.350 align:middle line:84%
was to develop security policies
and procedures to protect

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:84%
sensitive compartmented
information dealing

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
with reverse engineering
of ET crafts.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's a number
of projects that

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:84%
were occurring during
my time there, probably

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:84%
even obviously
before I got there,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that dealt with what we've
recovered from crash sites.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
We, the United
States government,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:84%
had what we called a DART team,
a Downed Aircraft Recovery

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Team.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And their job was to go out
and collect debris and bring it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.880 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, some of
their jobs dealt

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:84%
with our aircrafts
that had crashed,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:90%
test crafts out of Nellis.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:84%
We would develop a
craft, try to fly it.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.259 align:middle line:84%
If it crashed, we
would recover it.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of that,
their work, dealt

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:84%
with unexplained or
unidentified aircrafts.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
The debris that they
found, the craft itself,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.570 align:middle line:84%
and even the live ETs in that
craft were all brought back

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
to Area 51 or to Tonopah Air
Base, which was in the Nellis

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Test and Training Range to be
analyzed, reverse engineered.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
It was our job to
develop policies

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:84%
to protect those
programs, and that's

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:90%
one of the things I did there.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And these projects
really involved

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
some very highly classified,
at least at that time

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
period, of crafts and trying
to reverse engineer propulsion

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:84%
systems of ET
crafts, communication

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:84%
systems on these crafts,
energy devices on these crafts.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
People get confused
with is that they

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:84%
think that a aircraft from some
other planet, we call a UFO,

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
we identify it as an identified
extraterrestrial craft,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
or we call an identified alien
craft, during that time period.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.180 align:middle line:90%
They all were different.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:84%
They came from
different civilizations.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:90%
They weren't the same.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:90%
They weren't built the same.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
the same technology.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So that was a very,
very difficult job

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:84%
for our US and even some
foreign scientists working

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.060 align:middle line:84%
with us there to
try to understand

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:90%
foreign and alien technology.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.830 align:middle line:84%
When you would get a craft
in there that you can't even

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:84%
find an instrument panel,
which we would consider Earth

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
aircraft, such as maybe a
Soviet aircraft or a plane,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
where they would have an
instrument panel or some way

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:90%
to steer.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
alien crafts, they

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any type
of instrument panels.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have any
type of known steering

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms within the craft.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.020 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
any type of avionics

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.210 align:middle line:84%
that we could understand, which
meant that these crafts were so

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
advanced, probably
thousands of years,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:84%
as I was told by one particular
scientist working there while I

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:90%
was working on the project.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.190 align:middle line:84%
These crafts have
to be thousands

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of years more advanced than
us because we can't figure out

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
how their pilots can sit in
this chair and fly this craft.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And what they found over time,
and some of the information

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.620 align:middle line:90%
came from EBE 1.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:84%
EBE 1, before he died, gave
us a lot of information.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of the information that
they were using in the '80s

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand reverse
engineering these crafts,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.260 align:middle line:84%
these alien crafts,
was it the Eben craft

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:84%
that crashed in
Corona, New Mexico?

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
They did a lot of the
navigation through mind control.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Their thoughts would be
transferred from their brain

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
into their hands, and
that's why these crafts had,

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:84%
they call them
handprint instruments.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
There was a place
for their hands

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:84%
to go into the instrument panel,
and they can control the craft

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:90%
through their mind.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So they figured that some of
these crafts that they had out

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.850 align:middle line:84%
there that they had recovered
flew in some type of manner.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:84%
But some of these were
so advanced I don't even

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:84%
think today they can understand
how to fly some of them.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Richard, you're actually
confirming actual crash sites

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:90%
of nonterrestrial aircrafts.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Is this a rare
happening, or is it

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
going on much more
frequently than we thought?

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, during the
time frame I was there,

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.380 align:middle line:84%
during the time frame I was in
intelligence reading documents,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I never responded
to a crash site.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't on a DART team.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I got the information after
they had recovered the crafts.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:10%
But I learned a
lot of information

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:10%
after I left intelligence,
because Wendelle Stevens,

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:10%
Colonel Wendelle Stevens,
retired Air Force,

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:10%
he was on those DART teams.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And at UFO conventions, he would
relate things to us about them.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
The frequency of these
crafts crashing primarily

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:90%
in the Southwest.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Now switch back to
when I was there.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I knew of crashes,
reading in documents,

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.860 align:middle line:84%
that have happened
right around Area 51

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
or right in either Western
or Southwestern Nevada.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:84%
One particular crash site
that occurred in 1968,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:84%
near a mine in Western
Nevada, south of a place

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:84%
called Hawthorne, Nevada, the
miners witnessed this crash.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know what it was.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know it was
a UFO or an alien craft.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But they responded,
because they thought

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.090 align:middle line:90%
it was just a regular airplane.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:84%
They thought they'd go up
and help and see what it was.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
When they got there, the craft
was actually broken open,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and there was dead
extraterrestrials

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:90%
inside, two of them.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But these particular
species, and I

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
these species were,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.750 align:middle line:84%
emitted a toxic fume
from their body,

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that has
been written by Stan Friedman,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:90%
too, when they decay.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:84%
They were dead, and
so their bodies,

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.390 align:middle line:84%
because they were from a
different civilization,

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.390 align:middle line:84%
they breathed a
different atmosphere.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So they emitted a strong
amount of methane gas.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So when those miners got
there and two of the miners

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:84%
went in to try to
help, they immediately

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.850 align:middle line:90%
died of an overdose of gas.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, the
other miners left,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.475 align:middle line:84%
and other agencies
got involved in it.

00:08:25.475 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Finally, it was turned
over to the Air Force.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.200 align:middle line:84%
We went out there,
and we recovered it.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.749 align:middle line:84%
Now, Wendelle Stevens tells
this story in deep more details

00:08:33.749 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:90%
than I can.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:90%
I obviously wasn't there.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:84%
But the craft itself, when I
got to Area 51, was still there.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.520 align:middle line:84%
That particular
craft that crashed,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:84%
they were still analyzing
it 13 years, 14 years later.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not sure where
the bodies of those ETs

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.050 align:middle line:90%
are or were.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't ever briefed
into that, so I

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:90%
can't explain where they went.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.970 align:middle line:90%
But that craft was still there.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The director of Skunk Works
once said there are two types

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs, man-made
UFOs and ET UFOs.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Are we right to
assume that we have

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.368 align:middle line:84%
functional UFOs in the fleet of
the United States of America?

00:09:24.368 --> 00:09:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can tell you that
there was an incident that

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:90%
happened in Texas, in 1980.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.250 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Cash-Landrum case,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:84%
where two women and one of
the sons of one of the women

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:90%
were driving on a road in Texas.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And they encountered this UFO
that was flying above them.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And this UFO appeared to be
in some kind of distress.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And it flew right, real
close to their vehicle.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:84%
They were right on
top of their vehicle.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And they later became sick
from radiation sickness.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a lot
of stories out there

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:84%
about what that craft was
because these two ladies,

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and they're both dead
now, and you can easily--

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.330 align:middle line:84%
the viewers can easily
google the Cash-Landrum case

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.500 align:middle line:90%
and read all about it.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.230 align:middle line:84%
They were taken to a hospital
because they were sick.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.440 align:middle line:84%
But when this was
happening, they

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.900 align:middle line:84%
saw military
helicopters flying all

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:90%
over the area around this craft.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
was the government tried

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:90%
to reverse engineer a craft.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:84%
They got it working, except
for the propulsion system.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get the alien
technology propulsion to work,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:90%
or they couldn't function it.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So they took that
alien technology off,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
the propulsion
system off, and they

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
placed a fusion
reactor propulsion

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:84%
system, an experimental
one, on this craft.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.960 align:middle line:84%
They flew it around Nevada for
months and months and months,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:90%
and it worked.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So now they were flying it
to a military base in Texas.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And as they were going, they
developed a lot of problems.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
Cash-Landrum Case.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's an example
that we could reverse

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:14.180 align:middle line:84%
engineer some of the
crafts that we found

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
but not all the operating
systems aboard these crafts,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:84%
such as the communication
systems, the energy, whatever

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:84%
operated the energy, and
then the propulsion system.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know they have ever
reverse engineered or could

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:36.460 align:middle line:84%
understand all the different
alien propulsion systems

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that we had in our
arsenal at Area 51.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.430 align:middle line:10%
The first person ever that
came public and talked

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:10%
about re-engineering
UFO technology

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.140 align:middle line:10%
was actually Bob Lazar,
back in the days.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Rick, you have your
hands on some documents

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.900 align:middle line:84%
that show names of people
working at Area 51.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Was Bob Lazar ever on this base?

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the documents that were
just recently given to some

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:84%
of us were entry control
logs for Area 51,

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:84%
or it was called the Air Force
Flight Test Center, Det 3.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the log, but it was for
Area 51, Groom Lake Complex

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and Papoose Complex,
or on the document,

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.470 align:middle line:90%
it was called S2 Complex.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
The documents are
from 1979 to 1990.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of them.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But looking through
there, Bob Lazar's names

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
is in there from March
till June 1st of 1987.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So it verified
that, at some point,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:90%
he didn't have a clearance.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:84%
He was in an administrative
area without access.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, it showed
that he did have clearance

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:05.000 align:middle line:84%
through Los Alamos Laboratories,
and he did have clearance.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
He was only there for
a short period of time,

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:90%
according to that document.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> People are claiming and
there are a lot of rumors

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
what's going on, on Area
51, on the site itself.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:84%
What technology,
what experiments

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:84%
do you know of are
taking place at Area 51?

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Area 51 had a highly
classified program that was run

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:84%
by NSA, and this isn't
classified anymore.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:90%
It's been revealed.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And Kirtland Air Force Base
had this and some other bases.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:84%
We had a laser base, a
ground-based laser that

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:90%
could be shot up into the sky.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, we knew Soviet
satellites flew over

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
all our military bases
in space, just like ours

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:90%
did within the Soviet Union.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:84%
We knew, tracking these
Soviet satellites,

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
we knew when and the time
period that they were

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.600 align:middle line:90%
flying over a particular base.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
In the old days, when we knew
that there was a satellite,

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:90%
we knew that R-7--

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
we call them R-7 satellite,
Russian satellite number 7,

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.980 align:middle line:84%
is going to fly over it
during that particular time,

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:90%
they would hide everything.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It would take a long time to
hide, so they'd have an hour

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.960 align:middle line:90%
and prepare.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, back in those
days, what we did,

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:84%
this was just an
experimental, we'd

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:84%
shoot that laser up into the
lens of the Soviet satellite,

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.450 align:middle line:84%
blinding it so as
it was passing over.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And we were able
to direct the beam.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So we'd follow that
Soviet satellite

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:84%
while it came over
Area 51, virtually

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:84%
not allowing it to take any
photographs of the base.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Now they had that
at Area 51, and I

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
believe that was the
first base they used it.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.130 align:middle line:84%
They also used it at
Kirtland Air Force Base,

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and I talked about that in
the Paul Bennewitz episode

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:10.290 align:middle line:84%
But they also had other
technologies there.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:84%
They had a very, very
advanced telescope.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
It was run by the Air Force
and the National Reconnaissance

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Office, which was, back
then, a secret agency

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:84%
within the government,
that photographed--

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
had a unique camera
in it, and this is

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:90%
in the '80s technology--

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:90%
photographed objects in space.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:84%
We knew where our satellites
were, and now even in the '80s,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
we had a lot of
satellites up there,

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:84%
but we also knew where other
satellites or other objects

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And this was a highly
classified program

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:90%
during that time period.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
They would be photographing
and taking pictures or tracking

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.330 align:middle line:84%
these UFOs, and we
knew, that at that time,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:90%
those UFOs were ET UFOs.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:90%
And why did we know?

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
they visited Earth

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:10.120 align:middle line:84%
because we had a hangar full of
crashed UFOs or alien crafts,

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and we had recovered
them from 1947 on.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't fully
briefed into this,

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.960 align:middle line:90%
but we were able to track.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
we found, or they found,

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:27.355 align:middle line:84%
was that the UFOs had distinct
flying navigational systems.

00:16:27.355 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:84%
They had a track that
they used to come

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:84%
into the Earth's atmosphere
that was unique for them.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when we were monitoring
these objects in space,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:84%
over a period of time, we
were able to track them

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and realized, my
gosh, we know how

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:90%
they come into our atmosphere.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Now not all of them came
in in the exact same way,

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
but they had a unique way,
and I can't explain it,

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.510 align:middle line:84%
of navigating through
our atmosphere

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:90%
to come down to the surface.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And so they were able
to use computers,

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:13.040 align:middle line:84%
even back in those days, to
identify this special tracking

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they immediately knew
that that particular object,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.329 align:middle line:84%
rather than being
an unknown, we knew

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
that was an extraterrestrial
craft coming

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:90%
into Earth's atmosphere.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, the United
States government knows when

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
a UFO is going to
enter US airspace.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there any technology
in order to prevent UFOs from

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.364 align:middle line:84%
entering the airspace
that you know of?

00:17:39.364 --> 00:17:43.325 align:middle line:84%
>> There's number of things
that we tried that I knew about,

00:17:43.325 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of things, I'm
sure that they're doing that I

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:84%
don't know about
trying to prevent them.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand
that ET technology is

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years or even
more, maybe even millions

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:90%
of years more advanced than us.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're all coming
from different planets.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not as if
there's just one craft

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:90%
with different ETs aboard.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.350 align:middle line:90%
They're different technologies.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have to develop all
these different methods

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:84%
to try to track various
different technologies from all

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.240 align:middle line:84%
over the universe,
and I don't know

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.925 align:middle line:90%
that they've ever done that.

00:18:18.925 --> 00:18:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
dealing with a craft,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.640 align:middle line:84%
as it was explained
to me once, we

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
were trying to track a F-117
aircraft with 1940s technology,

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and that's an analogy,
loose analogy.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no way we could
do it because number one,

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:84%
the F-117 was a
stealth aircraft.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
We had really archaic radar
systems back in the 1940s.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.220 align:middle line:84%
German government,
Germans perfected probably

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
one of the most advanced
during World War II.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't have detected
anything more advanced now.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Now here we are, in
the 21st century,

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:84%
trying to track, or the 20th
century and the 21st century,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:84%
trying to track ET crafts that
have come from light years

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:84%
away, probably, some
of them, we know.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:middle line:90%
And we're trying to track them.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.925 align:middle line:84%
It would be almost
virtually impossible.

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But once they get
into the atmosphere

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.340 align:middle line:90%
is to try to defend Earth.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.330 align:middle line:90%
We see them.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.970 align:middle line:84%
We can track them, but
try to defend them,

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.660 align:middle line:84%
try to develop some sort
of weapon system to defend,

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we've
done that yet.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So publicly, there has
never been reported any case

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:84%
of hostile behavior from ET
crafts against bases or even

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:90%
humans, themselves.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you know of any cases?

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Is there a threat?

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, there have been cases.

00:19:54.005 --> 00:19:57.004 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.004 --> 00:20:03.290 align:middle line:84%
A classic case occurred from a
National Guard plane flying out

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:84%
of, I believe, Tennessee,
back in the late '40s.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.560 align:middle line:84%
There was an object
spotted on radar.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:84%
The plane went up there
to try to identify it,

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:90%
and the plane was shot down.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Our plane was shot down.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
consensus is, and there's

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.740 align:middle line:84%
other people that have
studied this, Dr. Friedman,

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:84%
the late Dr.
Friedman and others,

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and it was a consensus that
that UFO shot down the Air Force

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.460 align:middle line:90%
plane.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And it crashed,
killing the pilot.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:34.640 align:middle line:90%
Now there's other cases.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:84%
There was a case in Vietnam,
during the Vietnam War,

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.260 align:middle line:84%
where an F-4 Phantom
jet was taking off

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:84%
from an airbase in
Central Vietnam,

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.860 align:middle line:90%
going to bomb a target.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall the exact date,
but I believe it was in '68.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And the F-4 is flying up, and
as it got to a certain altitude

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.160 align:middle line:84%
to fly to wherever
it was going to bomb,

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:90%
and there was three F-4s.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But this one particular
pilot sees this bright object

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:middle line:90%
coming right at him.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And he's, of course,
thinking it's

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.630 align:middle line:84%
some missile that the Viet
Cong or the North Vietnamese

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:90%
fired at him.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So he made evasive
maneuvers, but he

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:90%
couldn't get away from it.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:84%
It just shadowed him
every place he went.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:84%
The other two pilots
saw what he was doing

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:84%
but didn't see this object,
and they were, of course,

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:84%
talking to him on the radio
saying, what are you doing?

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:84%
He said, this object
is coming right at me.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, the
pilot, the object

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:84%
got so close to him
that the pilot went down

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.580 align:middle line:90%
to a low altitude and ejected.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And then those two other
pilots saw the F-4 explode.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they saw this other
craft, a saucer-shaped craft,

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:84%
the other two
described, flying away.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, the pilot
landed and was rescued.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:84%
He didn't die, but
this is in Vietnam.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, we knew that the North
Vietnamese and the Viet Cong

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:84%
didn't have that technology
or no other countries

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:84%
in Southeast Asia, during the
'60s, had that technology.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.420 align:middle line:90%
So what could that have been?

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:90%
That was probably a UFO.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Why was it tracking that F-4?

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't know about that.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.800 align:middle line:84%
That's just two cases of
several that involved planes

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that could have
been downed by UFOs.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> On the contrary, there
might be chances for alliances

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:84%
between humans and
nonterrestrial lifeforms

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.470 align:middle line:90%
and intelligences.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Rick, is the United States
government in cooperation

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:90%
with ET intelligence?

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know that
specific answer.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:59.360 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that, from the
information that EBE provided

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
to us from 1947 to 1952, when
he was in our care and custody,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.950 align:middle line:84%
he gave us a lot of information
about other ET races,

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:90%
some of them extremely hostile.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.845 align:middle line:84%
And he warned us about
some races, which

00:23:15.845 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have access to
all that information,

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
but he warned us about
two particular races,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.630 align:middle line:90%
and this is in the '50s.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And he told us
that we would have

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:84%
to develop some type
of weapon system

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.910 align:middle line:84%
because if those
particular races of aliens

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:84%
came here to Earth, we would
have to defend ourselves.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, EBE didn't know what
we had at that time period.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.760 align:middle line:84%
He knew we had nuclear
weapons, because he

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:84%
knew about the explosion in
'45 in the New Mexico desert,

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and he knew about Japan, the
two that we exploded in Japan.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:84%
He knew that we had these weapon
systems that were enormous.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't know that whether
what we had then, in the '50s,

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.720 align:middle line:90%
would be able to defeat.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So he provided us with some
information and some technology

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and obviously, we got
a lot of technology

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
from the two recovered
crafts, the one we recovered

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:84%
near Corona and the one up
near Horse Mesa in 1949.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:84%
That helped us, I
think, in understanding

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.640 align:middle line:84%
advanced technology to
assist us in some maybe

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:90%
future war with the ETs.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.750 align:middle line:84%
But I was never fully
briefed into that,

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:90%
so I really don't know.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I know today,
we're experimenting

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:46.070 align:middle line:84%
with hypersonic weapons
systems, kinetic systems,

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
directed energy weapons, fusion
weapon systems, and these

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.090 align:middle line:84%
all are being developed
right as we speak today,

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.560 align:middle line:90%
in the 21st century.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And is some of that
alien technology?

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Could be.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> One must assume that
nonterrestrials that are far

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:09.510 align:middle line:84%
more advanced than humans are
might have technology that

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.880 align:middle line:90%
serves healing purposes.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Is there only technology that
has ever been re-engineered

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:20.250 align:middle line:90%
from that area and field?

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I know of limited
information on that subject.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I had access to some things
when I worked for the Institute

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:84%
for Advanced Studies,
but I'm not a doctor.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't fully
understand what I read

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and what information
I was given.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And so for me to say
something here, on the air,

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
I think might distort what
the real purpose of what

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.970 align:middle line:90%
we got from EBE.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I know that EBE provided us with
something that could possibly

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
heal, but I can't
really go into details

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:84%
because, again, I'm
not a medical doctor,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and I can't fully explain it.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Rick, so you confirmed that
there are actual crashed UFOs

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.220 align:middle line:90%
and it happened more than once.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:84%
What happened to all these
crafts around the globe that

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:15.780 align:middle line:84%
have been collected
and brought to Area 51,

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and how many are there?

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I know Bob Lazar talked
about several of them.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.100 align:middle line:84%
He has seen, I think,
nine or something.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:84%
How much do you know, and
what happened with those?

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I can only talk
about what we,

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.250 align:middle line:84%
the United States
government, has.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure countries
around the world,

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:84%
we knew that the Soviet
Union had crashed UFOs,

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and they had them at
a particular place

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.330 align:middle line:90%
at Kapustin Yar.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.540 align:middle line:84%
They had underground facilities
where they stored them.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:90%
We satellite pictures.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.178 align:middle line:90%
We know that for a fact.

00:26:48.178 --> 00:26:49.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure about the Chinese.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they probably did
and other countries have.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you that,
during my time at Area 51,

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I knew they had caverns
under the base, old mines

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:84%
that they dug out that they
stored these crafts in.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the exact number,
but at one point during a UFO

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.170 align:middle line:84%
convention some years
ago, Wendelle Stevens

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:90%
talked about 60.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know if there were
60 just turning his time period

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.720 align:middle line:84%
or whether he had access
to information later on.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But only during the
time I was at Area 51,

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and I can only speak about
that, there were probably

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:84%
20 that I could think about
that were stored there,

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.060 align:middle line:84%
either in hangars above
ground or in the facilities

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:37.860 align:middle line:90%
underground.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Now there was a vast cavern
of storage underground,

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:49.185 align:middle line:84%
and they were continuously
being constructed or built.

00:27:49.185 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:84%
There were a number of projects
going on when I was there

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:57.270 align:middle line:84%
to dig underground tunnels, to
build a road, underground road,

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:03.060 align:middle line:84%
from the Katomen area of
Area 51 down to Papoose Lake

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:84%
so you wouldn't
have to drive to it.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And I understand, even
today, as I saw on YouTube,

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.360 align:middle line:84%
that there is a massive
tunnel system that

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:84%
runs the 17 miles from
Groom Lake to Papoose.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.820 align:middle line:90%
Now this is on YouTube.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So take it for
what that's worth.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
But during my time
there, there was

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of construction
going on there,

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:90%
underground construction.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your
question, I would

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.280 align:middle line:84%
assume that most of
those reverse engineer

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:84%
or captured crafts were in
an underground facility.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, we also had a
facility at Tonopah,

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:84%
which is another Air Force Base,
80 miles away from Area 51,

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.680 align:middle line:84%
within the Nellis Test
and Training Range.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.230 align:middle line:84%
That particular
air base was used

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:84%
to develop the F-117
stealth aircraft,

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's being used today
for other things like that.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Now there had four
complexes there

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:84%
that were underground,
although I've never

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:90%
been to their facilities.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I just know that
they had them, and I

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:07.800 align:middle line:84%
would guess that if
they needed space

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:13.530 align:middle line:84%
to store a downed ET craft,
they could use something there

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.330 align:middle line:90%
at Tonopah, also.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, as an agent,
you've been to Germany,

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and you actually speak
German, which a lot of people

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:90%
don't know.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Does the United States
of America help,

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:84%
assist, or even brief other
countries on the UFO subject?

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, during my time
period there in intelligence,

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:90%
we shared some information.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:90%
We didn't share all of it.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was there had to have
been some kind of need to know.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.670 align:middle line:84%
There had to be some
kind of special reason

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
why we would brief another
intelligence agencies.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Now I wasn't involved in any
kind of diplomatic channels.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure what
the diplomats did.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there
were probably cases

00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:00.240 align:middle line:84%
where we would share information
through the diplomatic channels

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.500 align:middle line:90%
with other countries.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.430 align:middle line:84%
But I know that if
we needed something,

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:09.030 align:middle line:84%
when I was stationed in Germany
as an intelligence officer,

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:13.170 align:middle line:84%
we used German intelligence, the
Bundesnachrichtendienst, which

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:17.190 align:middle line:84%
is the BND, the German
equivalent of the CIA,

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.120 align:middle line:84%
for a number of our operations,
because they had access

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to things that we couldn't,
especially inside the Soviet

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Union.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.450 align:middle line:84%
BND had a good source
network inside.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So if we got some information,
maybe from a satellite,

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.930 align:middle line:84%
that there was maybe a
particular UFO recovery

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:39.210 align:middle line:84%
operation going on in Siberia or
some place inside Soviet Union,

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.390 align:middle line:84%
we would go to our
contacts within BND,

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and we'd sit down with
them and say, listen,

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.180 align:middle line:84%
on this date, one of our
satellites spotted this.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Might even show them
the satellite picture.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And we want to know
what's going on there.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And BND would take
it and run with it.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't always
get what we wanted back,

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.720 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of times, they would
come back with the information.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:84%
With, yeah, there was some
kind of satellite or something

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.360 align:middle line:90%
that crashed.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know what it
is, and they recovered it.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And now they're taking
it to Kapustin Yar.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, we had an
asset there, so we knew.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.180 align:middle line:90%
But BND had access.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.090 align:middle line:90%
So we did that.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:22.890 align:middle line:90%
We shared.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the only time,
and it's the only way

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.230 align:middle line:90%
that we did that inside Germany.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm sure it probably
happened in other locations,

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.900 align:middle line:84%
but, again,
compartmentalization.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.500 align:middle line:84%
We used BND, and sometimes
they would use us.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Does the BND know that there
are UFOs and they are from

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.590 align:middle line:90%
nonterrestrial origin?

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I briefed one
particular BND officer,

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:90%
so he would know.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.510 align:middle line:84%
What he did with that
information, I don't know.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Rick, fascinating.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked about
Area 51 containing

00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:84%
different
nonterrestrial aircraft.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So Area 51 cannot be the
only base that has these kind

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:90%
of craft.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Are there other bases that do
have their hands on this kind

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.430 align:middle line:90%
of technology, as well?

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, Dugway Proving
Grounds, in Utah,

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.690 align:middle line:84%
which is sometime
called Area 52.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:24.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a particular
location in Alaska

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.690 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of research and
development is going on.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:32.670 align:middle line:84%
It's near Fort Wainwright,
an Army base in Alaska.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And probably the
most secretive base

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.930 align:middle line:84%
that just recently
has been disclosed

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:41.520 align:middle line:84%
is Johnson Island, which is
one of the American possession

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:90%
islands, west of Hawaii.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The United States of America
has UFOs not from this planet.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Rick, thank you so much
for being on the show.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very welcome, Tim.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Tim.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
watching "Cosmic Disclosure."
