>> JAY WEIDNER: Hey, Jason.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> JASON RICE: Thank
you, Jay, for having me.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:10%
>> JAY: Let's get to
the 1991 agreement.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:10%
>> RICE: Sure.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.465 align:middle line:10%
>> JAY: What is that?

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:29.540 align:middle line:10%
>> RICE: The 1991 agreement has
to do with an arrangement made

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:10%
between the Cabal and what is
now referred to as the Mars

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.710 align:middle line:10%
Germans, since they moved
pretty much the bulk

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:10%
of their civilization out
of Antarctica to Mars.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And so what it revolves
around is, the late '80s,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:84%
the Cabal was looking to
establish their own lunar

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.214 align:middle line:84%
operations command,
their own moon base.

00:00:53.214 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And they ran up against
the same problem

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:90%
the Germans had years before.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.600 align:middle line:90%
It's all spoken for.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So they've got to bribe,
pay, or arrange somebody else

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:90%
to give up property.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the Germans, having
their established base there,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.030 align:middle line:84%
already had a place
that was workable.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And so the 1991 agreement
between the Cabal and the Mars

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Germans has to do with the
Cabal taking over the lunar base

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.300 align:middle line:90%
that the Germans occupied.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Wow.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The terms of their
lease with the Draco were that

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.280 align:middle line:84%
they were required to have
a 100-year lease and that

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
payments for those were
already taken care of.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So the Cabal didn't
have to pay for it,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:84%
but the Germans did have
to find a new tenant.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.530 align:middle line:90%
They had moved out of that base.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to be
away from the Draco.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So with another
technology transfer,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:84%
they got some more land
where they wanted away

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:90%
from the Draco.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: On the moon?

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: On the moon.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: OK.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: And so the terms of
getting out of that lease is

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:90%
they had to find a new tenant.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the
'80s was around the time

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:84%
that Operation Solar
Warden was in full swing

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and they really needed
a base on the moon.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And so they worked out with the
Antarctic Germans an exchange,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:84%
again, for taking
over the property.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.490 align:middle line:84%
This time, the exchange
was for the Cabal

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:84%
to provide two divisions, or the
equivalent of 24,000 soldiers,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
for use where and when
the Antarctic Mars

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Germans needed them.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.050 align:middle line:84%
In order for the Mars Germans
to get out of their lunar base

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle line:84%
with the Draco, in addition
to finding another tenant,

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:84%
they had to provide 10 of
their 12 carrier battle groups

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.292 align:middle line:84%
to the use of the Draco where
and when as they needed.

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
They weren't going
to destroy them,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.271 align:middle line:84%
but the Draco
wanted to use them.

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And whenever they asked what
they were going to be used for,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:90%
they told them border patrol.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The agreement between the
Cabal and the Mars Germans

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.940 align:middle line:84%
included the use of the
Lunar Operations Command

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:90%
in exchange for 24,000 soldiers.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
constituted the beginnings

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
of the Interplanetary
Defense and Reaction Forces.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
There are a total of four
divisions of ground troops

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.680 align:middle line:90%
in that program.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Two divisions are
wholly and completely

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:90%
manned by Mars Germans.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
There are no other
soldiers in it.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Two divisions are mixed and they
include soldiers from Earth.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: What year did you
finally get into IDARF?

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:10%
>> RICE: Started training
for IDARF in 1994.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: 1994.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.237 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: One of the first.

00:03:39.237 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: One of the first.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Tell me exactly what you did
for this organization, IDARF.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sure.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, the way that IDARF is
arranged, the organization,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:84%
is that any officer
rank 05 and above,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.470 align:middle line:84%
which is lieutenant colonel
and up through the colonel

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and generals, are specifically
and only Mars Germans.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:84%
They did not allow any
other citizen or soldier

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:90%
to be above the rank of major.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was, along with
the other Earth soldiers,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
is that we filled out
the ranks, basically.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:90%
They were enlisted.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:90%
They were officers.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Being an officer, I was required
to be in charge of a platoon,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:84%
later on as a company XO,
as a company commander,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
as a battalion staff officer,
as a battalion executive

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:84%
officer when I was a major,
as a regimental staff officer,

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually
back into the training

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.006 align:middle line:84%
regiment as a company commander
and as a staff officer.

00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Taking orders
from the Germans?

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.296 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Taking orders
from the Germans.

00:04:53.296 --> 00:04:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: How did you get
along with the Germans?

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I get along
with just about anybody.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Dealing with the
German chain of command

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:84%
was challenging
in and of itself,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
make no mistake about that,
because I was from Earth.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I was already, in their
eyes, handicapped.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And so anything and
everything that they

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
wanted to blame on Earth
soldiers, be it officer

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:90%
or enlisted, they did.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were petty or
some of them were very--

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
buried animosities
that came out, again,

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
because of their extreme
dislike of the Cabal.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we were the
next extension of that.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So why did the Germans
allow the Cabal and the others,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
United States, to form a
separate secret space program?

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.636 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't they just wipe it
out before it got started?

00:05:43.636 --> 00:05:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: That's a great question
and I've wondered that myself.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I had asked
Johann about that,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.830 align:middle line:84%
his answer was that they needed
the production capabilities

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:84%
of this planet because they
didn't have an equivalent

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:90%
manufacturing capability.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And also, they didn't have the
wide range of R&D available.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And so having co-opted all the
corporations on this planet,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.015 align:middle line:84%
that they had that vast resource
that was available to them.

00:06:13.015 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You keep
bringing up the Draco.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Why should we be
concerned about them?

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The Draco are a
group of alien entities.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.120 align:middle line:90%
They're highly psychic.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:84%
They are several hundred
thousand years more

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:90%
advanced than we are.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're are also very,
very, very negative entities.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Their mission, if you will,
is conquering, controlling,

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle line:90%
dominating.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
That is what they--
that's their MO.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And so being able to conquer,
dominate, and control the Earth

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.970 align:middle line:84%
has been one of the
goals that they've had.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And so by using their
proxies, either willingly

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
or unwillingly, they've
been able to try and further

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:90%
that particular agenda.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So the Draco
have been around,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:90%
hanging with us for a while.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They've been
around for quite a while.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:90%
They're extremely frightening.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
training I went through

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.320 align:middle line:84%
included a number of
what would be considered

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:84%
really scary aliens,
as far as preparing

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:84%
the soldiers for
battling and countering,

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:90%
fighting, communicating.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.191 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:21.648 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Why don't the Draco
just come in and conquer Earth?

00:07:21.648 --> 00:07:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Why do they do it--

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:90%
use such subterfuge to rule us?

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: That's
a great question.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And it ties in also
with, why didn't they

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.730 align:middle line:84%
go and dig up this ancient
technology themselves?

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.600 align:middle line:84%
They're signatories to a number
of intergalactic treaties

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that prevents them from
interfacing, interacting,

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
or tampering with indigenous
populations or their planet.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, does it mean
they follow that?

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:84%
They found loopholes
or ways around it.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
they've been able to do

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that most effectively
here has been

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.390 align:middle line:84%
through their human
proxies and being

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
able to control and manipulate
and do whatever it is

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:90%
that they needed to have done.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And for the Draco, they
needed these fleets

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of ships and the ground soldiers
that came with them, the IDARF,

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:84%
because for one thing, the
human shape and pattern tends

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:90%
to be a common blueprint.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we look a lot more like
the other planetary inhabitants

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:90%
than they do.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And so the other thing
is that why would

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:84%
they want to kill off
their own soldiers when

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
they've got proxies that are
willing to do it for them?

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.976 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You're trained
here on Earth for a while,

00:08:32.976 --> 00:08:34.559 align:middle line:84%
then you went to the
moon and trained,

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and then you went
to Mars and trained.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.119 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's correct.

00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So what was your
training like on the moon?

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The moon training
revolved around getting us

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:84%
oriented to
shipboard operations.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Even though we were technically
just catching a ride

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:84%
from the canners,
we still needed

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
to know the emergency
procedures, evacuation

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:84%
procedures, what was the
water lines versus power,

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.320 align:middle line:84%
areas that we shouldn't
go in and around,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:84%
emergency evacuations,
firefighting,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:84%
all the different things
that, as a visitor on board

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
of a not so safe all
the time spaceship,

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
you need to know what and
where and how to go about doing

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:90%
what you need to do.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And this took place on
the Cabal's base on the moon

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
that they had gotten
from the Germans?

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's correct.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And what
was the base like?

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:84%
What was, just like, the
buildings like and what was it?

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, it
was underground.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And the one that
I was going into,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.420 align:middle line:84%
when I wasn't in the underground
base, I was on board a ship.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:84%
They believed in
train like you fight.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So most of the
training that we--

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.117 align:middle line:84%
took place and took part in
was on board a training ship

00:09:46.117 --> 00:09:47.450 align:middle line:90%
that they used for this purpose.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Not on the moon?

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Not on the
moon surface itself.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: What were
these ships like?

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Cramped.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:84%
It's about like being
on board a US Navy ship.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And you go and it's not much
room getting through a door.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.115 align:middle line:84%
There are bulkheads all over the
place from safety perspective,

00:10:04.115 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
so they can seal off
different parts of the ship.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: When you were
training on the moon,

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
you were still under the
auspices of these Germans

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:90%
in command?

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: I see.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Still
under their command,

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:84%
still under their
control and their rules.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And some of the moon
training included orientation

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.530 align:middle line:84%
to microgravity operations,
getting more familiarized

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.002 align:middle line:84%
with our battle suits,
our combat suits.

00:10:30.002 --> 00:10:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: How long did it take
you to go from the Earth

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:90%
to the moon?

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Minutes.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:34.582 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Minutes?

00:10:34.582 --> 00:10:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: If that.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Here's a section
from that hypnosis session.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:45.370 align:middle line:10%
>> GEORGINA CANNON: Tell
me about your first move

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:50.852 align:middle line:10%
as a group to another
planet, which one it was.

00:10:50.852 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The first
move was to the moon.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.860 align:middle line:90%
It was all by shuttle.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> CANNON: From where?

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: From Area 51.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I thought-- [CHUCKLING]
We transitioned

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:84%
from the underground
base to Area 51.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:84%
That was our departure
point, the Nevada desert.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.011 align:middle line:90%
>> CANNON: Mhm.

00:11:25.011 --> 00:11:28.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: We flew from there
by shuttle up to the Lunar

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.545 align:middle line:84%
Operations Command, where
our next training began.

00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:10%
And we stayed there
for six months learning

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:10%
about microgravity,
learning about pros and cons

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:10%
to each of the systems.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>> CANNON: Was this taking
place in a classroom?

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sometimes.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> CANNON: Where else
was it taking place?

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.044 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They also had
us on ships in space.

00:12:01.044 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>> CANNON: Oh, in space, OK.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.950 align:middle line:90%
What did they look like?

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:19.152 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Triangular, large,
smooth sides, wedge--

00:12:19.152 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:90%
almost wedge shaped.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.650 align:middle line:90%
These were huge.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> CANNON: OK.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Big.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> CANNON: OK.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: There were only
about 20 something of us left.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> CANNON: How many?

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: 26 out of the 34.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Not all of them died though.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So after you got
done training on the moon,

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:90%
you went to Mars and trained?

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It was more of
interface between ship

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:90%
to ground.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So it was incorporating the
prior two training bases

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.280 align:middle line:84%
into the new one, which
involved departing the ship,

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:84%
how do you do combat drops,
what you do for a combat drop,

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
where you go, the different
aspects to getting out

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:84%
of the shuttle or jumping
out of the shuttle

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:84%
or coming down on the
gliders that we used

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
or the anti-grav packs for
shooting out, basically.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Wow, crazy.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.566 align:middle line:84%
So what was the
base on Mars like?

00:13:31.566 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Again, most of the
time on Mars that I spent was

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:90%
on board a ship.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I saw entrances to facilities
and that's about all

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.760 align:middle line:90%
I was able to see.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Most of the other time, we
were out in the boonies.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: What was it like
being on the surface of Mars?

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It's about like walking
through a desert with rocks

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and canyons, and there's an
otherworldly presence to it,

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:58.420 align:middle line:84%
what looked like washouts, but
are depressions in the surface.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Could you
breathe the air?

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: We didn't.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: You didn't?

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.672 align:middle line:90%
You had helmets that had--

00:14:02.672 --> 00:14:02.836 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: We didn't.

00:14:02.836 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Just makes it easier.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Could you take your
helmet off and breathe?

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: We were told
never to, so we didn't.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.157 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Were there other
alien groups on Mars?

00:14:12.157 --> 00:14:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: From what I
understand, there were,

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.865 align:middle line:90%
but I never saw them.

00:14:14.865 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Were they fighting or
any kind of fighting going on?

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Mm-mm.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: None, never?

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Everybody lived in peace?

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Everybody co-existed.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was peaceful
or not, I never saw it.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
We were always out
in a training area.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Do you know where
they got their water?

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They recycled a
lot of the waste and used it

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:90%
for water.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I understand that
some of the water

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:84%
came from the locked up
ice that was part of Mars.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the
supplies that we used

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:90%
were recycled materials.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.775 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You spent how much
time on Mars training?

00:14:46.775 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Four months.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Four months.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.443 align:middle line:84%
Again, we'll take a look
at your hypnosis session.

00:14:50.443 --> 00:14:53.884 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.884 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> CANNON: Tell me about the
time that you went to another

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.685 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned Mars before.

00:15:03.685 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.868 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:15:07.868 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:90%
I went to Mars after the moon.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> CANNON: After the moon?

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: To do more
zero gravity training,

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
microgravity training,
to do more ship ops,

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do more--

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:29.980 align:middle line:90%
more ground ops.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>> CANNON: What did the people
look like on Mars, the beings?

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: I only saw humans.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.201 align:middle line:90%
And we were kept isolated.

00:15:41.201 --> 00:15:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>> CANNON: Oh, OK.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.216 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The Germans had
two bases, two cities there.

00:15:46.216 --> 00:15:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>> CANNON: Germans
had two bases?

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They were
cities, really big ones.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>> CANNON: What were
the Germans doing there?

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:53.894 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Living.

00:15:53.894 --> 00:15:55.935 align:middle line:84%
>> CANNON: Are these above
ground or underground,

00:15:55.935 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:90%
these bases?

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:57.744 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Underground.

00:15:57.744 --> 00:15:59.186 align:middle line:90%
>> CANNON: Underground.

00:15:59.186 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: New Berlin,
New Wurzburg.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.875 align:middle line:84%
>> CANNON: What's above ground,
if the bases were underground?

00:16:07.875 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:17.322 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Radiation
shielding, dirt, rock.

00:16:17.322 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
They have-- they have entrances
that reach the surface.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:29.065 align:middle line:84%
And they do have
some structures,

00:16:29.065 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:90%
but they're mostly mechanical.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.574 align:middle line:84%
>> CANNON: So where did
the inhabitants live?

00:16:37.574 --> 00:16:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Below ground.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Base is carved out of the rock.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: What did Johann tell
you about the Mars base,

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.890 align:middle line:90%
if anything?

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.514 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: He didn't
tell me much at all.

00:16:52.514 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And part of that, I think, is
some of his own programming

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:84%
that he's not
allowed to talk about

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.850 align:middle line:84%
because they very closely
guard any information about New

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.568 align:middle line:90%
Berlin or New Wurzburg.

00:17:02.568 --> 00:17:04.359 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Those are the
titles of the cities?

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.775 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Those are
the two cities.

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:08.680 align:middle line:84%
My unit was the
3rd Panzer Division

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and they were referred
to as the Berlin Bears.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:84%
When they started their own
military force, the Mars

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Germans, they took
over, inherited,

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
copied a lot of the
original World War II German

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:29.020 align:middle line:84%
units, insignia, symbols,
including their uniforms.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, our dress
uniform, one of them,

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:84%
looked just like the
black SS uniform.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And the Americans
wouldn't wear them

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:90%
unless they were ordered to.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.755 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You spent how much
time on Mars training?

00:17:42.755 --> 00:17:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Four months.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Four months.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, you
were finally deployed?

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.777 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: At the end of that,
I was finally deployed.

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Anything about Mars that
you can remember that we need

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:90%
to know?

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It's occupied and
there are more than just humans

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:84%
The Mars Germans have about
three million citizens

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that live on Mars, from
what Johann was telling me.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
That could be
disinformation because he

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:84%
was unable to talk
about a lot of things.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the fact that he would
be able to tell me that number,

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I have some suspect to that.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Is it possible that
there is ongoing interactions

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:25.510 align:middle line:84%
of a military kind in space
between the Cabal and these

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Martian Germans?

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: With 10 of their
carrier groups still being

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:84%
blockaded out of
our solar system,

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:84%
it explains a lot about the
Cabal's activities here.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that with that many of
their units off on operations,

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:90%
it has emboldened the Cabal.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:84%
I did not know of
and wasn't aware

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
of active fighting between the
Cabal and the Mars Germans.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And that isn't to say that the
long-term plans of the Mars

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Germans aren't to come and try
and exert some type of control

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:90%
over Earth.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
That's originally
where they're from.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Appear to me they're
taking a rear guard action

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.600 align:middle line:84%
to build up their offenses
and their weaponry,

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and that they're going to come
back here and try to take over

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:90%
the Earth.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's possible.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Why wouldn't the
Cabal be very afraid of this?

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, they were
terrified of the fact that they

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:84%
had all these battle groups,
these carrier battle groups.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
12 was what they had
at the time that they

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.770 align:middle line:84%
started sending them out on
exercises, long-term exercises.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a
huge fear of theirs.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, had
the Mars Germans not

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
been required to deploy 10
of their carrier groups,

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and we very well could
have been at war with them

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
because of too many opposing
troops in the same space.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:84%
You can be rest assured
that the modern secret space

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
program includes ground
forces, even though what we've

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:84%
heard about mostly
has been the space

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
portion or the spaceships,
or whether it's

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Operation Solar Warden or the US
Navy's SSP, or the Air Force's

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.570 align:middle line:90%
SSP.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Yeah, let's
talk about that.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.749 align:middle line:90%
How many SSPs are there?

00:20:13.749 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: There's a bunch.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:16.451 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: There's a bunch.

00:20:16.451 --> 00:20:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And this started
after the 1991 agreement.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, after the United States
announced to these world

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.260 align:middle line:84%
leaders that we had a
secret space program,

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
they all began to
want their own.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:84%
What countries had secret
space programs and what kind

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:90%
of alliances were going on?

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, the US version of
their space program started off

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.680 align:middle line:90%
as Operation Solar Warden.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:84%
At the time that
we were building

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:84%
out our original
Operation Solar Warden,

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:51.650 align:middle line:84%
the USSR was also working on
their own secret space program

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.450 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Brazil, Russia, India,
China, South Africa, those

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:84%
are some of the other
countries that have

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:90%
their own secret space program.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:84%
They're not nearly as
large as the US is.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Is there a governing
body to make sure they

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:90%
don't interfere with each other?

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Not necessarily a
formalized program like that.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
The one common denominator
would be the Cabal.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
The exception to that are the
majority of the BRICs countries

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:84%
that have their own independent
secret space program.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And they've been able
to group together

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
into a large enough
force that they

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:84%
can't be immediately wiped out
by the Cabal's SSP programs.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: What I heard was
around this same time period,

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:84%
the people in the Cabal informed
all the world's leaders that

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.740 align:middle line:90%
they had a secret space program.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.586 align:middle line:90%
Is that true or not?

00:21:46.586 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: That's
my understanding,

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that they had come forward and
come clean because they started

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:90%
building them up in the '80s.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And the USSR was
well aware of it.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And those with more
intelligence assets

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.280 align:middle line:84%
were aware that the US
was doing something.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And even if they didn't
know exactly what it was,

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
identify the differences

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:84%
between the UFOs
they were seeing

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.932 align:middle line:84%
and ones they were
seeing previously.

00:22:16.932 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Makes sense.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yeah.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And so these other
countries then decided that

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:21.734 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to get in.

00:22:21.734 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they didn't have the
resources of the United States,

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.465 align:middle line:84%
so they combined and
allied with other countries

00:22:26.465 --> 00:22:27.870 align:middle line:90%
and other forces, or what?

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great
description of what happened.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of countries,
and families even, that

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:84%
are wealthy enough that
they wanted and could afford

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:84%
to either develop their
own, steal their own,

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.770 align:middle line:84%
build their own, or acquire
their own space program.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And that included holes,
small ships, small shuttles,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:90%
to larger ships.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:84%
The other countries
that don't have

00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.080 align:middle line:84%
as many assets available to
them have bonded and grouped

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.200 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So we can say that the
military has several different

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.320 align:middle line:90%
space programs.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:90%
The Air Force has one.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:90%
The Navy has one.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:84%
We know William
Tompkins has said that.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.797 align:middle line:84%
You are probably,
at least initially,

00:23:13.797 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:84%
part of the Navy
one, I would imagine.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's what I suspect.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And then China has a
secret space program.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Russia has a
secret space program.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They're probably
the oldest next to the United

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:26.780 align:middle line:90%

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And we know that there
are various alliances,

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.900 align:middle line:90%
like the UK and France.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.305 align:middle line:84%
And others have the
secret space program.

00:23:35.305 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of the third
world countries

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.630 align:middle line:84%
probably don't have
one yet, but they may.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They contribute
personnel to allies' secret

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
space programs, but they don't
have the resources or budgets

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.709 align:middle line:84%
for hiding and stealing a bunch
of money from their own people.

00:23:52.709 --> 00:23:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: We have several secret
space programs and they're all

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:90%
competing with each other.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And there must be alliances
and conflicts and things

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.181 align:middle line:84%
like that going on, just
like every human endeavor.

00:24:03.181 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's correct.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.860 align:middle line:90%
They have their own agendas.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:84%
A large portion of what's being
referred to as the Alliance

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:16.310 align:middle line:84%
are groups that were either
hunted down or turned

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.460 align:middle line:84%
against by the Cabal,
that have bonded

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.557 align:middle line:90%
together out of survival.

00:24:22.557 --> 00:24:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Let's talk
about the Alliance.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:84%
The Alliance is people
within the Cabal

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.801 align:middle line:84%
who don't like the Cabal and
don't like what it's doing?

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's correct.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.740 align:middle line:84%
People within, as well
as some of those families

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that may not have the
resources, but have

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:84%
a lot of money, financial
assets that they can use,

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:84%
that they can then leverage
to help or become a part of

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.180 align:middle line:84%
or buy their way into or
assist with the Alliance.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them are as
pure as the driven snow.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: No, they're not.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: There's a large
number of them that, again,

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
were part and parcel to the
Cabal's plans and operations,

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:03.156 align:middle line:84%
and were involved with it and
had as much responsibility

00:25:03.156 --> 00:25:05.780 align:middle line:84%
for some of the things that have
happened as some of the Cabal.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:84%
But out of their own sense
and need for self-survival,

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:90%
they joined the Alliance.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Again, it gets back to the
disclosure requirements

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.970 align:middle line:84%
that the Cabal has to follow
because of their agreements

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:84%
with alien societies for
releasing information, as well

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:84%
as some of their own
ideological beliefs.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is just a partial
screen, half truths, half lies,

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:84%
partial disclosures
it's still considered

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:84%
to be a disclosure on
their part and puts them

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.850 align:middle line:84%
in a position of
saying, hey, look,

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:84%
we've been telling
you this all along.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.886 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it
was just Hollywood

00:25:46.886 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:90%
that was making things up?

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So that they then
have the ability,

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.530 align:middle line:84%
some point down
the road, to claim

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:90%
that they weren't lying to us.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: CYA.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: CYA.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.500 align:middle line:84%
They will go to any lengths
to further their agenda

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.720 align:middle line:90%
and to protect themselves.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They have, of course,
Admiral Forrestal apparently

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:84%
locked away in a safe and
secured military hospital, who

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:90%
allegedly committed suicide.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:90%
It was 1949.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to come out.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.460 align:middle line:84%
That was right when they were
working with the Antarctic

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Germans.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.100 align:middle line:90%
President Kennedy--

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Forrestal
was Kennedy's mentor.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: He was his mentor and
also by all accounts, a very,

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:38.800 align:middle line:84%
very positive individual that
was patriotic and cared about

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.600 align:middle line:90%
his country.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Went to Germany in
1945 with JFK to see the German

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: So he knew.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.944 align:middle line:84%
Then he was thrown out of a
window at Bethesda Hospital.

00:26:48.944 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's right.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And then
Kennedy died in '63.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.950 align:middle line:84%
What would the world be
like if they would just

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
release these things that you've
actually encountered and seen,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.832 align:middle line:90%
these technologies?

00:26:58.832 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:84%
What would the
world today be like?

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Oh, the world today
would go through a renaissance

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.460 align:middle line:90%
of new birth, new growth.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:84%
People wouldn't have to
work at jobs they hate

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and they despise
getting up for, but are

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:14.540 align:middle line:84%
required to because
of safety, security,

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.560 align:middle line:90%
caring for their family.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.110 align:middle line:84%
You could get on a
transportation craft

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and go anywhere in the
solar system or galaxy.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And say you wanted to go work
on the other side of the Milky

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Way.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's nothing
stopping you from doing that.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:84%
No power bills
because every house

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.130 align:middle line:84%
would have a shoebox-sized
power generator that

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:84%
didn't require renewables,
that didn't require

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:90%
any input, any fossil fuels.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.710 align:middle line:84%
The education technology,
some of the technology

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that they used with us
were chair beds that we

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:90%
would lay on.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And similar to what's been
portrayed in some movies,

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.070 align:middle line:90%
you just get a download.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like
you automatically

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:90%
can spout something.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.109 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a subtle and
that you can think about, OK,

00:28:05.109 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:84%
how am I going to
solve this problem,

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:90%
and you know the answer.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Whereas before, you didn't
have the German language

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.390 align:middle line:84%
in your mind or another
language, or math

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.227 align:middle line:84%
or any of the science
related to it.

00:28:17.227 --> 00:28:19.310 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have to send
our kids to these schools

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:84%
to be babysat and
to not learn much

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:84%
in the way of a
public education.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.830 align:middle line:84%
You could sit down
in a chair and learn

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:28.040 align:middle line:84%
anything you wanted to
over the period of an hour.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.190 align:middle line:90%
People wouldn't be going crazy.

of some of the crimes
that have been committed,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.450 align:middle line:84%
but I see these
technologies coming out

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.900 align:middle line:84%
as being an opportunity
for humanity

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to go through a
renaissance of growth.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:53.030 align:middle line:84%
That's how I see it, for these
technologies to come out.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:84%

chance that this will happen?

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes, I do.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.920 align:middle line:90%

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.855 align:middle line:90%

00:28:59.855 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:84%

humanity and its resiliency.

we have been seeing, going back

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:84%
years, but more recently
the exponential changes

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.090 align:middle line:84%
that we've been seeing from
people waking up and seeing

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:84%
the lies that they
are fed a steady diet

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.410 align:middle line:90%
of on a regular basis.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And when enough
people wake up, I

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:84%
think we will see
a lot of change

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and then that's when we
can demand full disclosure.
