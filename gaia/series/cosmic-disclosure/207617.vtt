>> TIM: They all know how to
move through time as a space.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.210 align:middle line:84%
There are also beings, like,
higher frequency beings,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that are living outside
of time, and that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
brings a whole new perspective
upon the construct of time.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:84%
If you want to contact them,
there are places on this Earth,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.210 align:middle line:84%
pretty much the
ancient sites, where

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:84%
this compression of frequency
of natural-occurring frequencies

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and flows of energy
has happened.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.720 align:middle line:84%
There has been contact
over the years.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:10%
>> CRAMER: Some of the really
ancient species are some

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:10%
of the most involved in
what's happening here.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
After having had
conversations with them,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.713 align:middle line:84%
I'm far less concerned
about negative outcomes

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.380 align:middle line:84%
because I just don't
think they're going

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.640 align:middle line:90%
to allow it at this point.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: I agree.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:90%
I think it's super interesting.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Even a species that has a
perspective outside of time

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know everything,
and they make mistakes.
