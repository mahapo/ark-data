>>EMERY SMITH: Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we are with Tim,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:10%
who is speaking with
us from Germany.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:10%
that's related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.395 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you so
much for having me.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.687 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, there's
an energetic shift

00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:84%
that everyone
perceives going on.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Though it's hard for many
people to articulate it,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.288 align:middle line:84%
what can you tell us
about this big shift?

00:00:41.288 --> 00:00:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So basically,
in this project,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:84%
when we were communicating with
extraterrestrial intelligences,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
we found out and we've been
warned that the Earth itself

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:84%
is going through an energetic
shift, which is going to affect

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:90%
everyone on the planet.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.069 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically
more than 15 years ago.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And it really created some
kind of tension in me.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:10%
So that I came up with a plan
and some kind of strategy

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.670 align:middle line:10%
that I gave to superiors
in order to proceed and to,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:10%
well, prepare the people
and the whole population

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.910 align:middle line:10%
of what's going to happen.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
at that time, I

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:84%
was told that that would not
be possible at that moment

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and that everything had to go
through certain administrative

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.460 align:middle line:90%
lines for it to unfold.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm quite happy that at
some point, even though it's

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:84%
pretty short notice
right now, it

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:84%
was able to release
something that they called

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.150 align:middle line:84%
independent field operator
status, which is actually

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:90%
what I'm currently doing.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of people
have asked me about that.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted to clarify it.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do you
define the shift

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:90%
that you're speaking about?

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So basically,
what we've been told

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
is that every 15,000 years,
the whole planetary sphere

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
goes through a cycle
and that we actually

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
should prepare ourselves for
a certain solar beam that

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
will come to Earth, which is
currently actually happening.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have some radio
stations that you could even

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:90%
access online for free.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that there's
an increased solar activity

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:90%
for one or two years now.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And most of the ET
presences that we've

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
talked to are convinced that
it's going to be a good thing.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So basically, energy and
radiation will come to us.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
basically, the reality field

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
right now will come tune

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.343 align:middle line:90%
to a very drastic change.

00:03:05.343 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So are you
saying-- is this radiation

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:84%
from a solar event or
something different?

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: There seemed to be many
natural phenomena included

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.460 align:middle line:90%
in this.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's
a solar event mainly

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:84%
because the Sun
is the main source

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:90%
of energy in the solar system.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
We have this heliocentric
reality field.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But it also comes with other
impacts on other fields

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.530 align:middle line:84%
and also the pole shift
that's going to happen.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that in
the history of Earth.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.537 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to see it again.

00:03:41.537 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, are
extraterrestrial beings involved

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:90%
with the upcoming shift?

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yes, very
much so, actually.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the Earth
itself is surrounded

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:84%
by presences of
extraterrestrial neighbors

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
that are actually observing
what's going to happen.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:84%
We're not quite
alone on this planet.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.050 align:middle line:84%
We still have some other
intelligences as well here.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And those civilizations seem
to be much more prepared

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:90%
for what's going to happen.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So they take the resources that
they have in order to help out.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What exactly
are they doing?

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So basically,
they are influencing

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.040 align:middle line:84%
from outside the reality
field that we have.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So I want to refer to a
scientifically researched

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
effect, which is dating
back to the 1970s.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.310 align:middle line:10%
And it's all about a Indian
guru called Maharishi.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:10%
He was trying to affect
the reality field by people

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:10%
communally or in a group
meditating and giving input

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:10%
into the reality field.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And what they found is that we
do have a significant effect

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:90%
on reality.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And I do know that Gaia as
well has done those experiments

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And they had incredible
results by bringing down

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:84%
certain statistical
numbers and even sponsoring

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:90%
certain mass meditation events.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We've seen through the
work of Lynne McTaggart as well

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
as the Maharishi effect that
the collective outpouring

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
of our thoughts can
positively affect realities.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
What is needed for an individual
to positively accomplish

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:90%
this effect?

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Perfect question.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So in the project, we
found three pillars

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:90%
that enhance the effect.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:84%
One is the individual knowledge
and training of the subject.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So everyone who's
already done meditation,

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.140 align:middle line:84%
who feels connected
to the reality field

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:84%
is much more trained than
somebody who's never ever

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
had a thought about
reality effects.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Number two is
actually repetition,

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.200 align:middle line:84%
which means the more we do it,
the more we exponentially grow

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:90%
the possibilities of it.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:84%
So the more we say
all shift happily now,

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
the more it adds to
the overall effect.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And the third one is super
important by reducing

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:90%
the number.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So Maharishi actually
was talking about the 1%.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's also this
so-called 1% effect,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
where a species needs to
have 1% of their population

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:90%
to learn something.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And then everyone in
the species learns it.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
But what we actually found
out is that it's not the 1%.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:84%
It's more the emotional
connectivity that we have.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So if we're aligned
with each other,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:84%
if we are emotionally
connected to each other,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
then this number
drastically goes down.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And in the projects,
we've even calculated that

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:90%
by measuring the frequencies.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So at best, if we are
as friends and as--

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
if we all agree upon
being on one mission,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:84%
then we only need
9,230 persons in order

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
to collectively change and
modify the whole reality

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:90%
field for everyone.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, you use the
term emotional connectivity

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
to be on the same
page for the project.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Intellectually, it may be
easy to be on the same page.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But what is it
specifically an emotion

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:90%
that makes it so effective?

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So what we've seen, which
is documented in the history--

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that there were times where
certain Asian tribes forced

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:46.780 align:middle line:84%
those people that they have
conquered to do praying for them

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
because they were
aware that we can

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
change the reality by praying
and giving input into the field.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But they were kind of surprised
because all those people

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:84%
that they enslaved and wanted
them to do praying work

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:90%
did not seem to do very much.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So the universe itself
seems to pick up

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:84%
on your free will and
your emotional seriousness

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
about your own mission and
contributing to this mission.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is the main
point that dedicates

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:84%
if you're on a successful
timeline or not.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you explain what
that emotional reality or energy

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:90%
is?

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, to be
very clear, they

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
did experiments on
the amount of energy

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:84%
that is being irradiated from
persons that are emotionally

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.360 align:middle line:90%
attached to each other.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So basically, in this
experiment, in those advanced

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:84%
groups, they took
couples versus people

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:84%
that were not emotionally
affected or interested

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
in the outcome of the
reality modification.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was seen that a couple
that is in love and that

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.860 align:middle line:84%
uses their collective
vibrations,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
they are so much more
multiplied in their effect

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:84%
compared to a single person
or even a loose group that

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
does not connect in
any way or kind of way.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, is this unique
to a biological life form?

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Or can AI program reality
achieve the same results?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: What we see is that
the psionic effect, which

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
is actually the psi waves
that come from your brain

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and from your interconnectivity
through your pineal gland

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.520 align:middle line:84%
to your outer field, that this
is actually a certain frequency.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a certain wave pattern.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:10%
So AI can actually utilize the
same frequency and wave pattern

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:10%
in order to modify reality?

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, you could
actually use an AI system.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you have enough power,
which means electricity, which

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:84%
is a lot that is
needed, then you

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:84%
could basically produce
any kind of simulation.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually
what scientists

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:84%
say is happening right
now, that we're actually

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.345 align:middle line:84%
in the tangible universe, that
this is a huge power source

00:10:22.345 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:90%
AI that's producing that.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So we all know from
quantum experiments

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:84%
that the energy amount that
one human has is enormous.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
It's much more than anything
that we could produce

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.932 align:middle line:90%
by conventional technology.

00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: With the
energetic changes

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.610 align:middle line:84%
we sense or feel on
the planet, would you

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:84%
say that it's a
harmonic of sorts?

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And if so, can we
isolate that harmonic

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and project an opposite energy
to shift us into a happy place

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that we all need on
Earth at this time?

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Technically,
yes, you can do that.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Actually, everything
irradiates a certain frequency.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that
done on a minor scale

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
in certain experiments
in those projects,

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
that you take the quantum
information of a certain state.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you abstract
certain information

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.300 align:middle line:90%
that you don't want to have.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And just in the same way that
it works with acoustic waves--

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:84%
so we've also seen that you can
counterbalance acoustic waves

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.650 align:middle line:84%
if you take the
equivalent frequencies

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:90%
and balance that out.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So you could do the same thing
with psionic waves and reality

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:90%
waves.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.750 align:middle line:84%
But if we're thinking
about a huge, huge scale,

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
like a planetary scale, everyone
who is inside of this field

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:84%
is automatically contributing
to the reality field.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, there's
this malevolent force

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
that has introduced
certain patterns

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and certain routines
that keep people

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:84%
in this sort of negative
struggle around their life

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:84%
so that they always reproduce
this kind of lower worldview.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do we understand the
source of this malevolent force?

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So there's
actually a trial

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:84%
going on outside of this planet
against a specific reptile

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.430 align:middle line:84%
species that is accused
of having set up

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.780 align:middle line:84%
this malevolent
installation upon Earth.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
As far as I'm
informed, it's still

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.590 align:middle line:90%
going on-- this kind of trial.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.430 align:middle line:84%
But what we see is
that there's basically

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:84%
a systematic way of influencing
people into thinking

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.988 align:middle line:90%
that they are limited.

00:12:56.988 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, who's
holding these reptilian

00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:90%
types accountable?

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That's fairly complex.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So basically, there
is an alliance

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.690 align:middle line:84%
of species that
hold other species

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:90%
accountable for their deeds.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And there is a very complex
set of rules of what is allowed

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.390 align:middle line:90%
and what is not allowed.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And this installation
that is systematically

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
placed upon this Earth,
it's been hidden inside

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.880 align:middle line:84%
of the sociocultural
aspects of humanity.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like as
if humanity would

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:90%
have done it to themselves.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But the trial actually came
up with quite clear evidence

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.080 align:middle line:84%
that there are
patterns that show

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:84%
that it's artificial-- or
malevolently, intentionally,

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.667 align:middle line:90%
been placed there.

00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do we know any of
these species who are holding

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.500 align:middle line:90%
these reptilians accountable?

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, the Greys, for
example, are one good example,

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.740 align:middle line:84%
that they are actually
doing some kind of the work

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.870 align:middle line:90%
to do the analysis.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But we also know that
there's some kind

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:90%
of collective of species.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:84%
You might want to call them
like Galactic Federation.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:90%
I've heard that term before.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So there are quite a few species
that actually come together

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of court
around Jupiter, I think.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And they are actually holding
court around those processes.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How has
it been resolved?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: As much as I know,
it's still currently going on.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's this one species that
is accused of having done that.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:52.110 align:middle line:84%
The consequences
are being debated.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I know that there
are possibilities

00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:01.770 align:middle line:84%
of freezing a species, which is
one of the punishment sort of.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But that's also--
the big question

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:84%
is the systematic approach
to it is self-replicating.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So there needs to be
some kind of solution

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:90%
to free Earth from it.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the US military
and different other Earth

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:84%
militaries have actually
removed the physical presence

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:29.470 align:middle line:84%
of those beings that are
accused of having installed it

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
from Earth-- from
the surface of Earth.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:84%
But the-- well, most humans are
actually involved in this setup.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
hard to get that--

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
to delete that in
some kind of way.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When you say
most humans are involved

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:90%
in the setup, what do you mean?

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So just be very clear,
for example, the school system.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.220 align:middle line:90%
So basically, the way--

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:90%
chairs, for example.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
If you take the way
people are sitting

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
around eight hours in their
respective field of work--

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:84%
eight hours-- and we know
that the energy lines

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.200 align:middle line:84%
around the spine are actually
responsible for your ability

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.950 align:middle line:84%
to utilize this energy, actually
like a garden hose, where you

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.630 align:middle line:90%
do a knot or something in it.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.980 align:middle line:84%
People know that sitting around
is really bad for your spine.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
But still, everyone's or
most people are doing it.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We're making efforts
to shift Earth differently

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.770 align:middle line:84%
when a lot of people
don't even know

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a
situation where we need

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:90%
to shift the Earth differently.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:90%
How do you fill that gap?

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The beautiful thing
is that if we're doing it

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:84%
collectively-- and again, we
only need around 9,230 people

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
When we're doing it
collectively in the right manner

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and using the right
techniques, then we

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:84%
can influence the reality
field and its outcome

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:07.339 align:middle line:84%
without having the need to find
tangible, logical solutions

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:90%
for every aspect of it.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So basically, things
will fall into place.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a
different approach than what

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
3D or level three consciousness
would do because level three

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-- and we find
that in the political systems

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.569 align:middle line:84%
everywhere-- is
you have a problem.

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:90%
And then you go into discussion.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:90%
And then you try to solve it.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.940 align:middle line:90%
And then you apply something.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, it will
not change drastically

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:90%
in most cases.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:90%
At least, this is what we found.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So basically, changing
the reality field

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and giving input into it will
make that fall into place

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.310 align:middle line:90%
automatically.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've suggested that if we
only have five minutes per day,

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:84%
just do the all
shift happily now.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And bring that energy into the
field because it collectively--

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and the more we do it, it
will collectively change

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:90%
the dynamics of the reality.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What specific
steps can our viewers

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
take to prepare their minds for
the planetary shift mentioned

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:90%
in the episode?

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: So step one
would be becoming aware

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:10%
that you're much more
than your 3D reality,

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:10%
becoming aware that you're
connected with the universe,

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.700 align:middle line:10%
that you're a representative
of the universe

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:10%
itself, of the
one creator field,

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:10%
and that you have full
potential of becoming

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:10%
the creator for
your own timeline.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't necessarily mean
that you create the timeline

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:90%
of other people as well.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And that is point number two.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Or aspect number two
is connect yourself.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Connect yourself with
those viewers of Gaia.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Connect yourself with the people
on Gaia and the speakers there.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And found a new
home through that.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you
collectively do that,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
you have the power to
influence all other beings.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
In research, we've even found
that the way, for example,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:90%
toxic groups act--

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:84%
if we bring this energy,
this information into people,

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:24.170 align:middle line:84%
then they will have a chance
to act differently because I

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.330 align:middle line:90%
know a lot of people are--

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:84%
well, they think the government
and all these organizations

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:90%
are malevolent.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would agree that those
organizations are mainly

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.330 align:middle line:90%
toxic in some kind of way.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But there are always people in
those groups that are actually

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
very benevolent or thinking
they're doing the right thing.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.220 align:middle line:84%
But they are limited
by their structure

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:84%
and by the
possibilities they have.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So even if we give energy
into them-- into soldiers,

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:84%
into politicians, into, well,
members of the intelligence

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:84%
community-- then
they automatically

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:90%
will benefit from that as well.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And they have new chances
in order to make decisions.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, Tim, as
people apply themselves

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:84%
to this all shift
happily now concept,

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.280 align:middle line:84%
is it enough that many
individuals do it individually?

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Or do they have to
do it collectively

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
for the most impact?

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So for the most
impact, the best thing

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.020 align:middle line:84%
would be that we do it
collectively at the same time

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.260 align:middle line:90%
and then do it repeatedly.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.720 align:middle line:84%
One approach for me
was to, for example,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.390 align:middle line:84%
get myself involved with social
media, Instagram and YouTube,

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:84%
in order to build a
community and to be

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:90%
involved with that community.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I myself take a lot
of positive energy

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:84%
from that because people
are so positive and nice

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:90%
around that community.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And they connect themselves
through that social media.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And this is kind of beautiful.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So everyone finds
their own home there.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.730 align:middle line:84%
In the end, it doesn't
really matter when we do it.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Because if we repeatedly
do it, then we

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:90%
will also cause the same effect.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.490 align:middle line:84%
The importance is that we
go out and, first of all,

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:13.760 align:middle line:84%
do what is necessary
to do for ourselves,

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:84%
for our own benefit,
and our own timeline,

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.860 align:middle line:90%
but also do it collectively.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Go to Gaia and connect through
this community as well.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How will the all shift
happily now manifestation impact

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:84%
the outcome of the
planetary shift?

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I'm super
convinced, actually,

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.850 align:middle line:90%
that this is going to be great.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I wouldn't
do it if I wasn't.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So I basically see
that we're already

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
forming a new community, a new
way how we deal with each other.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:84%
The feedback of the social
media is so beautiful.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And the people are communicating
and connecting with each other,

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:90%
which is beautiful too.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we are
teaching ourselves

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:84%
to become a holistic society
in a small, experimental group.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:84%
But we also having
this enormous effect

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:84%
of bringing energy into our
collective reality field.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm super thankful that Gaia
is as well participating

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and that you are
participating in that.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So I'm super positive about
the future and what's coming.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, Thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:90%
It's always great having you.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you so
much for having me.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for watching this
incredible journey with us.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to everyone
in "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And if we can just take
one second in order

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
to get into our connectivity
with this reality field

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and then just let's say it all
together, all shift happily now.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.528 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:22:51.528 --> 00:22:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Until next season.
