00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:21.900 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired special agent who served

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.330 align:middle line:10%
in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO/ET-related

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:10%
intelligence.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:10%
Today, we are discussing
an incident in Africa.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what UFO incident
took place in Africa and when?

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, in 1989,
South African Air Force tracked

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:84%
an unidentified flying object
flying from the northeast

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
to the southwest, near
the Kalahari Desert.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:10%
South African Air Force launched
a Mirage, a fighter jet,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:10%
and this aircraft had
an experimental weapon

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:10%
system on board, it's
called a THOR B, which

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.640 align:middle line:10%
is a tactical high energy--

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:10%
or high-powered
operational responder.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what THOR meant.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was a laser-directed
weapon system.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And this fighter
jet tracked this UFO

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and eventually got close enough
to try to identify it and then

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.370 align:middle line:84%
try to get
communications with it.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:84%
But it was a
saucer-shaped objects.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And all the
communications failed.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, the ground
forces, the command center

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
at the South African
Air Force base,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
authorized that pilot to
fire the experimental weapon,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
the THOR B weapon, which
the pilot did, and shot down

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:90%
this UFO.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It took it out.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Took it out with
this energy-directed weapon that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.470 align:middle line:90%
was a laser system.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was experimental
and this was 1989.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:84%
We have those weapons now,
but we're so far advanced.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:84%
But in '89, it was an
experimental weapon loaned

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.308 align:middle line:90%
to the South Africans by us.

00:02:07.308 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why would they fire
upon a craft that's not showing

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.787 align:middle line:90%
any aggression?

00:02:10.787 --> 00:02:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Good question.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't answered in any of
the reports that OSI received,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
but the pilot asked
for permission

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and the ground control or
commander authorized it,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:90%
and the pilot fired the weapon.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
It struck the UFO and the
UFO crashed in the desert.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So why did they decide
to use this experimental laser

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:84%
instead of a conventional
weapon that they have?

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: I think this Mirage
didn't have any other weapon

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:84%
system but this
experimental one.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.290 align:middle line:90%
It just happened to be on alert.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And when this craft came
across South Africa,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:84%
that pilot got the alert
notice and he took off.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And to the best of
my knowledge, he

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
was the only
aircraft in the air.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any other
Mirages, and therefore he

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
had the responsibility of
stopping this aircraft,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
trying to get it to land, and,
through a standard international

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:84%
hailing frequency, calling these
pilots in different languages.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Hey, stop, stop, stop flying.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:84%
You penetrated South
African airspace.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And there was no response.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the commander
authorized to shoot down,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:90%
and that's what the pilot did.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is known
about this THOR laser cannon?

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do they
know that would work

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.825 align:middle line:90%
on an extraterrestrial vehicle?

00:03:33.825 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: It's
a good question.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a energy direct
laser weapon system.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
It fired a burst of laser
energy at an object.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:90%
There was a limited range on it.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 2000 feet or
something to that effect.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And so the pilot had
to get pretty close.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
They're flying at 700
to 800 miles per hour.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:90%
They get close to fire that.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And who gave and why they did
this, that was never answered.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.640 align:middle line:84%
But the laser was shot at this
UFO, and it caused it to crash.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It was an experimental weapon,
the THOR B, back in those days.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:84%
And if you-- you can Google
online and read about it,

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's something that was
loaned to the South Africans.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we loaned
that to some other countries

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:90%
to protect their airspace.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.047 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they had.

00:04:30.047 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they used.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So why was the US
allowing South Africa Air Force

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
to utilize these
energy beam weapons?

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: This
goes back some years.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
There was a plethora of UFO
sightings over South Africa.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Also, at that time,
the country of Rhodesia

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:84%
had a number of incidents
involving UFOs, some hostile,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
including one particular
incident where a UFO forced down

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
a private airplane, which had
to land with some damage on it.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So we knew, the
United States knew

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:84%
that there were UFOs being
seen all over South Africa,

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and south in that
general area, including

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Rhodesia and some of the other
countries, Angola, Mozambique.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the United States
loaned this particular weapon

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
system to the South
African Air Force.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.570 align:middle line:84%
We were friends
with South Africa.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of the South
African pilots,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
they were flying American
airplanes because they still

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.910 align:middle line:84%
had the F-4s during
those days, were

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:90%
trained in the United States.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So we had a good relationship
with the South African Air

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to
let them experiment

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:84%
with one of these weapons, not
thinking that they would ever

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
use it, maybe in test
routes or test flights,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:84%
but come to find out, they
used it, and it worked.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
The big question is, was this
weapon system specifically made

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:90%
to shoot down a UFO?

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wish I knew the
answer to that question.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How was the
crashed object recovered?

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:90%
And what was those protocols?

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: The craft crashed
in the Kalahari Desert,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:90%
which was some distance away.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So it took some time for an Air
Force convoy, South African Air

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Force convoy, to get
to the site to find out

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:90%
exactly what they shot down.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:84%
But when they got there, they
found this huge craft which was

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
60-feet in diameter,
about 20 feet high.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:84%
It weighed 18 tons or
so, and it was open.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:84%
The bottom part of
the craft was open.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, they don't know if the
propulsion system malfunctioned

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.693 align:middle line:10%
and pushed open the bottom
part of the aircraft

00:06:46.693 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:10%
or whether there was
a door that opened.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:90%
That was confusing.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:90%
The report is online.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:84%
You can read this South
African report, most of it.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And the classified
portions you can't.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the OSI report
that I'm going to talk about

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:90%
is not online.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:90%
It's still classified.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's open, so when the South
African recovery team-- now this

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:84%
was a South African recovery
team, not the Special Downed

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Aircraft Recovery Team of
the United States Air Force.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:90%
They came much later.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
The South African
Air Force got there.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:90%
They saw the craft open.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
They started
removing the bodies.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.120 align:middle line:84%
The bodies were about
4 foot, 5 foot tall.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
They were large heads,
large eyes, gray in color.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:90%
They had tight-fitting suit.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.860 align:middle line:84%
They had no ears, two
slits for the nose,

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:84%
a small mouth, long arms,
typical extraterrestrial.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:90%
More like a Grey, OK?

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How many
occupants were there?

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: I believe
there were four occupants.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And they
all died on impact?

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Yeah, they
all died on impact.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.940 align:middle line:84%
There were no live
extraterrestrials.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, at some point
along the way,

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:84%
the South African
government notified

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.900 align:middle line:84%
the US embassy, Johannesburg,
and asked for assistance

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
They explained
what had happened.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:10%
The Air Force attaché, defense
attaché at the embassy,

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.250 align:middle line:10%
our embassy, then requested,
sent messages out,

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.340 align:middle line:10%
and a crash recovery
team, the SDART team,

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:10%
came from Wiesbaden Air Base,
in Germany, to South Africa

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:10%
four days later.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Along with that
SDART team, an OSI--

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:90%
two OSI agents came with it.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Eventually there were other OSIs
that came from South African

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:90%
operating location.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:90%
I think two others.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, so the SDART
team did get involved,

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:84%
but after the South African
Air Force had already

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.340 align:middle line:90%
started the recovery process.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And South Africa was uncertain
about techniques used

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:90%
in downed aircraft recovery.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to
do something that

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:84%
was detrimental
to their personnel

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.420 align:middle line:90%
or to the recovery operation.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly don't
want to get anybody injured

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:10.390 align:middle line:84%
by some type of atmospheric
condition or defense mechanisms

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:90%
that are on these UFOs.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
brought the Americans in,

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:84%
thinking that Americans
probably know more than they

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:90%
did about something like this.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.762 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the Air Force
came in, along with OSI.

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Let's talk
about the structure.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.560 align:middle line:84%
You said that this craft
is 60 feet in diameter.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Was there any markings on it
or anything significant inside

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:90%
you could describe?

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: There were
some markings on it.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.130 align:middle line:84%
The South African port
called them symbols.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I think they referred
to as symbols.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force Air
Force OSI report.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Call them characters.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
There were a number of figures
and characters inside the craft,

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.260 align:middle line:90%
along the control panel.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
There was a control panel with
three distinct sections where

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial could sit.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:84%
There were hand
controls similar to ones

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.430 align:middle line:84%
we found in many different types
of extraterrestrial crafts.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
They're using hands and their
mind to operate the vehicle.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.230 align:middle line:84%
There was two, I think,
television screens,

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
as they call them, or monitors
on the control platform.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:84%
There was tanks and other
things inside that probably

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:28.140 align:middle line:84%
was some sort of a atmosphere
once the aircraft was flying,

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.090 align:middle line:90%
they suspect.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:84%
As far as symbols
and characters,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.800 align:middle line:90%
there were some that were found.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And the OSI report
talks about them,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
matching them to
other crash sites.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
The South African report doesn't
mention that because the South

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.830 align:middle line:84%
African report was a generic
report, just relating

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:90%
what they did.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.050 align:middle line:84%
OSI report was more detailed,
comparing the symbols

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and the characters found inside
that craft with other characters

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.730 align:middle line:90%
found at other crash sites.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is this like a typical
Grey craft in your opinion?

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:90%
You said it was a disk.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.288 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Yeah, it
was a flying saucer.

00:11:06.288 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:90%
It was a typical Grey.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the Grey.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily the Ebens.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Because remember there's
two types of Greys.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:90%
The Ebens, definitely Grey.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
species of Greys

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.667 align:middle line:84%
that are responsible
for abductions.

00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did they
transport this craft?

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.458 align:middle line:90%
Where did they take it?

00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Initially, they
had to take that craft from

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.820 align:middle line:84%
the Kalahari Desert to
the South African base,

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.543 align:middle line:90%
which were miles away.

00:11:30.543 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't sure.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
It took them a long
time to figure out

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
how they were going to
transport this on vehicles.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.998 align:middle line:84%
And I guess they used two
different semi-trailers.

00:11:39.998 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:84%
They had to get a crane to
pick it up and transport it.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: That part of
it is somewhat sketchy.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.820 align:middle line:84%
The OSI report doesn't talk
about the transportation of it.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
The South African
report does talk

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:84%
about some form
of transportation.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm referring
only to the OSI report.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:84%
The OSI report said
it was transported

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
to a hangar at a South
African Air Force base.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:84%
It was placed in a
hangar, and that's

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.380 align:middle line:84%
when OSI began an
extensive examination

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:84%
of the craft, the bodies,
and any other debris

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:84%
that was found at
the crash site that

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:90%
was brought back to the hangar.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.230 align:middle line:90%
And not only did OSI--

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:84%
was OSI involved in
this, but Osa brought in,

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.050 align:middle line:84%
of course, the SDART team,
which contained technicians

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:90%
and scientists to study this.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
We also brought in teams from
Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Base in that time period, not
Area 51, but Wright-Patterson

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Air Force Base, to look at this
and try to examine and compare

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
it to other crash
retrieval operations

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:90%
that we were involved with.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What type of medical
and scientific examinations were

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:90%
done on these beings?

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, the
beings were eventually flown

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:84%
to the United States, and they
were flown to the Armed forces

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Institute of Pathology, which
still existed at the time

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:90%
in Washington, DC.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's where almost all
autopsies of extraterrestrials

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:90%
are done.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.540 align:middle line:84%
At that time period, they
had a special facility

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:84%
at the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:84%
for these particular
entities that are non-human.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:84%
They had separate facilities
and containment chambers

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and things like that,
hazardous material,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:84%
operational procedures, just
in case some toxic material

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.668 align:middle line:84%
that these extraterrestrials
contain in their body.

00:13:23.668 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Or biological agents.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Or
biological agents.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So they were taken there,
and a complete autopsy

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.940 align:middle line:90%
were done on all of them.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:84%
The analysis was that they
were, in fact, they call

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:90%
them a second species of Greys.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
We know of that because we had
other crash sites with Greys

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:90%
in them.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.920 align:middle line:10%
It took several years, actually,
into the '90s, to really study

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:10%
in depth this craft.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
was this craft

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:84%
was not the typical second
Greys type of craft.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like it was
a newer model Cadillac,

00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.950 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:90%
It was a newer model.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:84%
It had a different
propulsion system

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:84%
than some of the older ones that
we've recovered years before.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:84%
The, what they call the
technical system, or maybe

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:84%
the avionics system,
was something

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:90%
that they'd never seen before.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And there were these
huge, long vacuum tubes.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Initially, you couldn't
figure out what they were for.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:90%
They were in a craft--

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
inside the craft,
and they figured

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
they were some sort of
a equalization device

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
that might equal
the gravity inside

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:90%
or something to that effect.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Later in the '90s, they
determined that was exactly what

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.920 align:middle line:90%
they were for.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Once the craft got into the
air, it maintained the gravity.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
It was gravity
inducers, they called

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:84%
them, that kept the gravity
inside the craft to be normal.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:84%
We found many of
these kind of devices,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle line:84%
although different technologies
in a lot of different crafts.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I think today
we have that technology.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Rick, I know the two
reports are a little different.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Show me some of the
discrepancies in there,

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:16.450 align:middle line:84%
between the African Air Force
report and the OSI report.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, the South
African report talks of one

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial that was
captured alive and assaulted

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.990 align:middle line:90%
a recovery officer.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:10%
The OSI report
mentions that somebody

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:10%
was assaulted at the scene,
but the South African military

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:10%
neutralized or killed that
particular extraterrestrial.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:84%
The OSI report shows
four bodies that

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:84%
were transported
to Wright-Patterson

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and then to the Armed forces
Institute of Pathology.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Differences between the
South African report,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.640 align:middle line:84%
where you can go online
and read this report.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's also sketches on
this report of the crash site

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and of what the
extraterrestrials look like.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:84%
The OSI report, unfortunately,
is still classified,

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:84%
although there are some parts,
small sections of the OSI report

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:84%
that has been released under
FOIA in the early 2000s,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.060 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't give you a
whole lot of information.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:84%
I know of the full report,
which is probably 100 pages,

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and there is a
distinct difference

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.310 align:middle line:84%
between the South
African report,

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:84%
like I said, you can read
online, and in the OSI report.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So whether the live
extraterrestrial later

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.050 align:middle line:84%
died of something else
or whether it was killed,

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:84%
there were four
bodies transported,

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:84%
according to the OSI report
to Wright-Pat and then

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.210 align:middle line:84%
to the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Rick, you talked
about they are a type of Grey.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Can you give me more
distinct properties

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:90%
of what you mean by that?

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, in 1989, we
knew there were two different

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
races of Greys, the Ebens from
the 1940 Roswell-Corona crash,

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.820 align:middle line:84%
the 1949 Pelona Peak
crash, they were Ebens.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.480 align:middle line:90%
They were gray colored.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, the 1953 Kingman
craft had a different type

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
of Greys, not the
same biologics,

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:90%
and not the same technology.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And then jump ahead to abduction
experiences and incidents

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:90%
that were being done by Greys.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:84%
So the government
or DIA said, now

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:90%
that's the second type of Grey.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And those are more hostile
type compared to the Eben Greys

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:84%
are the more docile
or benevolent type.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what insights were
gained from looking at these

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
hieroglyphic symbols inside
the craft and outside?

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well,
we compared them--

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
OSI compared them to
other crafts that we had--

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:90%
or recovered.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.800 align:middle line:84%
They were out at the Nevada test
site and stashed away out there.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And what we did was we
looked at the characters

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:90%
on a different panels.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And a scientist
could connect, OK,

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:84%
maybe what these
symbols mean was

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.130 align:middle line:84%
how the operation of
these panels occurred,

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
or what these panels
meant, the explanation.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So all they had to do
was try to decipher what

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:84%
these symbols meant,
because they were

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
on these different panels
and in other places

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:90%
around the spacecraft.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So maybe these particular
symbols or characters

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:84%
meant that were some-- maybe
some oxygen inside here

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:90%
or something to that effect.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So they were trying
to trace these.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And since they had
other crafts that

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
were doing the
same thing to, I'm

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:84%
pretty sure with linguists and
other people pieced together

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:84%
what these symbols
or characters meant.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was there a
similarities to other craft,

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:84%
that you're aware
of, of the insignia?

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Yeah, there
were some comparisons.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were the same Greys,
the second class of Greys

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:84%
that were responsible
for abductions

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:84%
in these other crafts that
were found and connected

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:90%
to these Greys.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mentioned, there
are these little indentations

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:90%
for hands on the control panel.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:90%
Tell us more about that.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: They were
indentations as if the form

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.730 align:middle line:84%
of a hand could be placed
inside these indentations.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was it
metallic or plastic or--

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: I'm not sure
if they categorized that.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was a metal,
some form of a metal.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But the handprints
were indented in.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So as if the
extraterrestrials would just

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.490 align:middle line:84%
put their hands
in there, I guess,

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:90%
to try to fly the aircraft.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure exactly.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:49.310 align:middle line:84%
In the past, I think we realized
that the operation of these Grey

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:84%
crafts were done by
extraterrestrials in their mind

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.505 align:middle line:84%
control over the equipment
and the avionics system.

00:19:56.505 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did they mention
anything about the craft being

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.682 align:middle line:84%
organic or communicating
with anyone?

00:20:01.682 --> 00:20:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: No, they
didn't mention that.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:84%
They didn't mention
anything about organic

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:09.030 align:middle line:84%
or they didn't mention anything
about the communications

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.208 align:middle line:90%
in the OSI report.

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was there any follow
up with this case that you can

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:90%
speak as of today?

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Have you been following
it or know of anything?

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: One of the problems
OSI had was once the classified

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:84%
South African Air Force
report was given to OSI,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and based on what OSI did at
the crash site and at the hangar

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:90%
where the craft was--

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and remember, this
craft was eventually

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:84%
moved to the United
States by a ship.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:84%
It was taken down to the
port, South African port,

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
put it on a United
States Navy ship,

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and shipped back to
the United States,

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and eventually probably
ended up at Area 51.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.430 align:middle line:84%
But there were a
lot of discrepancies

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:90%
in the two reports.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And so what the US government
and intelligence community did

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:84%
was they sent a representative
to the US embassy

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:84%
in South Africa and got the
commander, the defense minister

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.470 align:middle line:84%
from South Africa
together, to try

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:12.040 align:middle line:84%
to weed out the discrepancies
between the two reports,

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
because there were a
lot of discrepancies.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to remember
that OSI wasn't on scene when

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
that South African
recovery occurred,

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
so they don't know
what happened there.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.810 align:middle line:84%
They only know what those
officers told OSI later,

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:84%
when OSI examined everything
inside that hangar.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But there were
discrepancies in the report.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was a big
question of why their report was

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:90%
different than the OSI report.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And again, OSI
wasn't at the scene.

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So what they're saying
in their report,

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:84%
some of it coincided with
OSI, but a lot of it didn't.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that they
ever actually mediated

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.050 align:middle line:90%
those two reports.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You speak of these
crashes in South America,

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Africa, North America,
we're working together.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything about
the Russians and Chinese

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and America working
together on these programs?

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: There's always
somebody that will talk rumors

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:84%
about a cooperation-- a secret
UN cooperation agreement between

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.740 align:middle line:84%
countries, sharing information
about extraterrestrials.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:90%
I've heard it.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.720 align:middle line:90%
I've heard rumors.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to some
people that used

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:90%
to work at the United Nations.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.220 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
secretive committee meetings

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.580 align:middle line:84%
between this country and
that country, the United

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:84%
States, Russia, China, United
States, even North Korea.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So there are probably
secret agreements

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:90%
between different countries.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't doubt that we
had an agreement with China

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and with Russia to
share technology,

00:22:54.030 --> 00:23:01.130 align:middle line:84%
because, let's face it, if China
recovers the UFO in their desert

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:06.710 align:middle line:84%
or in inner Mongolia, and
we recovered something

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:84%
in the desert of Nevada,
sharing technologies might

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.630 align:middle line:90%
help both countries.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Because China might look at it
differently than we look at it.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And we might look
at it differently

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:90%
than China looks at it.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And if we pool our
resources in a secret way,

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:84%
we might be able to better
both countries' technologies

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:84%
or understanding of these
extraterrestrial crafts.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:36.460 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference between
sharing high-tech technology

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.360 align:middle line:84%
with the Russians
or the Chinese.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.930 align:middle line:84%
If it's general knowledge,
questions pertaining

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.880 align:middle line:84%
to anything other
than a weapon system,

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I think sharing that technology
will help both countries.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And secretly doing this
within the United Nations.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's been Newsweek
articles and other articles

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:84%
out there about this
sharing of technology--

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and also that most of it's
done in the United Nations

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:84%
in sealed, closed rooms between
these different countries.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I think if we shared
something with the Russians

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and that will help
their technology,

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and they shared something
back to us regarding

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.820 align:middle line:84%
what they found in a particular
extraterrestrial craft,

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that would
help both countries.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And it also will
strengthen an alliance,

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.580 align:middle line:84%
even if it's a secretive
alliance between the United

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.340 align:middle line:84%
States and Russia,
or China if it

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:90%
was China sharing this with us.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.680 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure that the directed
weapons or any kind of weapon

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
systems that we found on
an extraterrestrial craft,

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.933 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't want the Russians or
the Chinese to know about that.

00:24:43.933 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, Rick, thank
you so much for all this
