00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.400 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
Cosmic Disclosure.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host David Wilcock, and
I'm here with our special guest

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.050 align:middle line:10%
Emery Smith.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And Emery has some absolutely
stunning information.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And he has taken great
risks to bring us

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.880 align:middle line:90%
what he's going to share today.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY SMITH: Thanks Dave.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.585 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate being here.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: That's good.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, it's fun.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I'm really glad you
finally decided to do this.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's long overdue.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I know.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.928 align:middle line:10%
You've been trying to get
me to do this for 10 years.

00:00:42.928 --> 00:00:47.800 align:middle line:10%
But certain recent
events have persuaded me

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.520 align:middle line:10%
maybe it's for my better
safety that we do this

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:10%
and also to educate the public.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:90%
And people deserve to know.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've believed
that my whole life.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But I always know there's
also a time for everything.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Yes.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, it seems with a
lot of the insiders

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to that once
we dig into their life

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:84%
before the military that
there was something going on

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:90%
before they ever even went in.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm curious, have you
had unusual experiences

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
prior to military
service that you

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:84%
think may be relevant
to share with us today?

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Absolutely,
it's personal.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you right
offhand that my grandfather was

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
in the army, and my
father was in the navy.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But when I was born, he was
already out of the navy.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And I always wanted
to be in the military.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I think I had my first
extraterrestrial visit in 1979,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and it was at our five acre
farm in Fort Myers, Florida.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
contact I've ever had.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
pleasant contact.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget it.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I was not contacted after until
between around 1999, '98, where

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.120 align:middle line:90%
it was like a complete landing.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And that one was a little bit
startling because I was camping

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:84%
out and wasn't ready for it
because it startled me at night

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:84%
because I just had
laid down, and I heard

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:90%
some footsteps walking up.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:90%
So that turned out--

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.759 align:middle line:84%
that was like the
two experiences.

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other one was after
the military, by the way.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.210 align:middle line:84%
But it was just a
little bit shocking.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.540 align:middle line:84%
But the first one, when I
was very young, and then

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.212 align:middle line:84%
after that I was
obsessed with, of course,

00:02:47.212 --> 00:02:48.170 align:middle line:90%
laying under the stars.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I probably slept more
outside of my house

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.992 align:middle line:84%
than I did inside the house
gazing up at the stars.

00:02:53.992 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Could you tell us a
little more about the contact

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:90%
in Fort Myers, Florida?

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Was there a craft that
you saw that landed?

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:90%
And then what happened?

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Describe the craft.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Describe exactly what happened.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Exactly what happened
was I had laid down to go

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.944 align:middle line:84%
to sleep in my sleeping
bag, and I looked up.

00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: You were outdoors.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I was outdoors, yeah.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:90%
We had a big farm out there.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of
the field in the middle,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing around.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And this flaming
disk comes very--

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:90%
just at a 45-degree angle--

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.720 align:middle line:84%
comes you know right out of
the sky, but moving very slow.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.700 align:middle line:90%
But red hot.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.490 align:middle line:90%
You could see the orange glow.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: How large was it?

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, from where I
was at, and it was probably

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:90%
at least 2,000--

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:90%
maybe 1,000 meters away--

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.362 align:middle line:84%
and I saw it go into
the woods and heard it.

00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I thought--

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.195 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, it was
probably just a meteorite.

00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Wow, it was like the
most brilliant meteorite

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:84%
But I also noticed that
it had a very odd shape.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:84%
So I just didn't
think anything of it.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And it actually landed
closer than I thought.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And the neighbors, like just
a couple of acres over--

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:84%
five or 10 acres
over in their swamp--

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:90%
and one of the--

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.080 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials came
out and walked over.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was next to a
barbed wire fence,

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:84%
you know the ones you
keep cows in with--

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:84%
four lines, sometimes
five of them.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.250 align:middle line:90%
And he's put fences.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:84%
You know those little
hooks that you--

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.882 align:middle line:90%
that barbed wire fence--

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, put that nail
to hold the barbed wire

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:84%
fence against the board,
right, that little hook.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So some of them were kind
of loosened, you know.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And I lay out a
tarp all the time.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I put my
sleeping bag on the tarp.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I laid down,
and I'm in the bag.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And I always, you know, being
who I am, tactical Emery,

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:90%
I always have my gun with me.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.414 align:middle line:84%
I did have my gun with
me in my sleeping bag.

00:05:04.414 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a
mummy sleeping bag.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:90%
And it was very cold.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.501 align:middle line:84%
And I heard
[MIMICKING WIRES GROANING],,

00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:90%
like someone jumping the fence.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Like just if I would
climb the fence,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and as the fence gets pushed
down, it goes through wire--

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:90%
the metal and the hooks.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And like
[MIMICKING WIRES GROANING]

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and then
[MIMICKING FEET THUDDING]

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Skunk ape?

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle line:90%
Bear panther?

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just like all right now.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And then immediately, I'm
listening to the footsteps.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very attuned
to that kind of stuff.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:90%
And I felt a little uneasy.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So I know maybe it was just
me, or maybe it was this being.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So I immediately just
grabbed my zipper,

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.745 align:middle line:84%
and I already had
my gun in my hand.

00:05:57.745 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And I unzipped with my gun and
flashlight and just stood up.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And there was a three foot
being right there looking at me.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.833 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: What did it look like?

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It was blue-gray,
and it had big blue eyes.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And it had a little
thing like on its head,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.497 align:middle line:90%
like you see in the movies--

00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
like we see in the
cartoon characters.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Like an antenna?

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Right, like a
little antenna or something.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: When you
say it had blue eyes,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:84%
so we're not talking
about a gray?

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No, no.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It was very scrawny,
and it was blue.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Like what color blue?

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Like your shirt?

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, it was
this kind of blue.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.550 align:middle line:90%
With the light on.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And me, I am still stuck
in my sleeping bag.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And it looked at me, and I think
the light really hurt its eyes.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.650 align:middle line:84%
I think actually it got
like what, oh, this is not

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.966 align:middle line:90%
going down right.

00:06:46.966 --> 00:06:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Uh-oh, I just crashed my craft.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.717 align:middle line:84%
I'm just looking for the
nearest help or assistance.

00:06:53.717 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's embarrassing to say, but
I jump up out of the sleeping

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.750 align:middle line:90%
bag, and I chase--

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.290 align:middle line:84%
you know I see him
going, running away.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:90%
And I'm chasing him.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And he goes into this
thicket, you know.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not like
chasing him to kill him.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm chasing because I'm
like come back, come back.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Like come here, dude.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like chasing this thing.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:84%
It goes right
through this thicket.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:90%
It was so thick there's no way.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:90%
I tried to go in there.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:90%
I got all cut up by the vines.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.226 align:middle line:84%
And then I hear
[MIMICKING WIRE GROANING],,

00:07:20.226 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:90%
and I looked next to fence.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:90%
The fence is right next to me.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:90%
And it gets really tight.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Like he's over there
jumping the fence again,

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:90%
heading back to that area.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.720 align:middle line:90%
So I was full of adrenaline.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it was
really late at night anyway.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:90%
But I did.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I took a little hike in that
area and to that direction,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't see anything else.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So there was nothing
exchanged on that.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.690 align:middle line:84%
It was just I think we
both startled each other.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: How human-like would
the face appear for a regular

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:90%
person?

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Would it look like a
regular person from Earth

00:07:59.090 --> 00:07:59.890 align:middle line:90%
with blue skin?

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Or was it something
different about the face?

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, the face was
fuller and more like more oval,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:90%
like a bubble.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Like if you got a bubble,
and you just barely--

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
if you get one of
those plastic balls,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and you just goes like
this, but it had features.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It had holes in its sides,
not ear lobes but holes.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.042 align:middle line:84%
And it was aware, more than
100% aware and very agile.

00:08:26.042 --> 00:08:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Were the eyes
larger than a regular human--

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes--

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: On Earth?

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, absolutely.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Like how much?

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: By at
least three times.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, it
was more eye like--

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:84%
the eye and the top of the
cranium, it was larger.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: But you said
the eyes were blue?

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Blue.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Blue eyes.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.289 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So it didn't have
the black like you see with

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.089 align:middle line:90%
the gray?

00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, when I say blue,
they didn't have a white.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.155 align:middle line:90%
It was blue eyes.

00:08:48.155 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:84%
There was no-- I
didn't see any pupils.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.654 align:middle line:84%
But it could have been
this protective layer.

00:08:51.654 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:84%
They have these lenses, a
lot of the extraterrestrials

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.461 align:middle line:90%
they wear over their eyes.

00:08:55.461 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: It was a
solid color blue?

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And did it
have a nose or just--

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, it had a nose.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:90%
Very small.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Very small
and a small mouth?

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Very
small mouth, yeah.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And it was
very like cartoonicle.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Like no way.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:90%
It was very comical in a way.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And how old
were you at the time?

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I was probably--

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.537 align:middle line:90%
'98, '90, was 18, 28.

00:09:22.537 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: All right, well
let's go back to the first one

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
because this could be
very relevant as we get

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:90%
into your military history.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Sure.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.922 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What happened
in the first event?

00:09:30.922 --> 00:09:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's go through
that step by step.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: OK, I had other
multiple events after that,

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.330 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't
understand what it was.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I would always
do a lot of sleepwalking

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:90%
when I was younger.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was always outside
in a hypnagogic state,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.700 align:middle line:84%
but I was very aware because
I'd always come back,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and mom, dad would see my
feet were dirty every morning.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And I have no idea.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And many times, they caught me
just heading out or heading in.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But never injured myself
or anything like that.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And then on this
particular evening, and it

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:90%
was not very late.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I just was told to go
outside telepathically.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: How old were you?

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I was in second grade,
so it was probably around '79.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So you got the
impulse to go outside.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah--

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: But this had been
happening to you before then?

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, this
was the first.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.735 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: This was
the first time.

00:10:24.735 --> 00:10:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: This was time
anything like that happened.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, it
started happening all the time.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just going out, but
not knowing why I'm out here

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:90%
and seeing lights and stuff.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.660 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, OK.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So I went outside in the
driveway, and we had a lake.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And I went up to the dock,
and I just looked up.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And there is this
beautiful blue craft.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:90%
And it was just silent.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was just so
amazed at its silence.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:90%
And this craft is there.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:90%
And I'm smiling, you know.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.080 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:90%
I even was like singing.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:90%
I was like trying or like--

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:90%
I was like, woohoo!

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
This is like-- I just started
whistling or something.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.586 align:middle line:90%
And it was very odd.

00:11:04.586 --> 00:11:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What did
the craft look like?

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:90%
What was the shape?

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.984 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It was blue,
and it was disk-shaped.

00:11:10.984 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: What kind of blue?

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Blue-white,
like white.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Not dark, not dark blue.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:84%
This is more like
a whitish bright,

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.096 align:middle line:90%
but you could see detail.

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:90%
But you couldn't see edges.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:28.230 align:middle line:84%
You could see outlines of
this, you know, classic shape.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was telepathically saying
that we're here, and we exist.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
be back for you.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And I
remember it very--

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:90%
like it was yesterday.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:90%
And it always stuck in my head.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:90%
This happened very shortly.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that the whole
event lasted maybe a minute

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.800 align:middle line:90%
and a half, two minutes.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's long.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:84%
For that to happen
today, it would

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:84%
not because we would shoot
you down in two seconds.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But back then, I think, it
was a little bit different.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
I think they had a
little more opportunity

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:84%
to make these types of
meetings with, not only me,

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:84%
but many other people and to
allow them to give us hope

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and to strive for
that later on in life.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
So then I just became
a really firm believer

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:90%
and all that stuff.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't talk about
it that much, neither

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:90%
would my family.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Do you think
that either your father

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:84%
or your grandfather might have
been involved in black ops?

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, my
grandfather was.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.306 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: In the army.

00:12:37.306 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And my father flew
in the Navy planes

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
looking for the submarines
coming into the Bahamas

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:90%
and off the coast of Florida.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.130 align:middle line:90%
So he was a spotter for that.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.015 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And he did
some other things,

00:12:53.015 --> 00:12:56.130 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think they
were intelligence related.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: You were on some kind
of extraterrestrial contact

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:90%
program it sounds like.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're describing
multiple events

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:90%
of leaving your house at night--

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, yes.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:90%
That was-- yes.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: And going outside.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And do you do you feel like
there are gaps in your memory

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:90%
from those events?

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Or what do you
think is happening

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.596 align:middle line:90%
when you go out there?

00:13:14.596 --> 00:13:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No, I remember a lot.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I was younger,
I had this gift.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.440 align:middle line:90%
I call it a gift.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.880 align:middle line:90%
I can control my dreams.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:90%
I know when I'm dreaming.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And it just recently
came back to me,

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.760 align:middle line:84%
just recently within the
past couple of months,

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.620 align:middle line:90%
where I can do it again.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And I just lost it after
I went into the military.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.376 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do it anymore when
I went into the military.

00:13:39.376 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And I started the
military early.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:90%
So about age 13.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: 13?

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It was with the
auxiliary of the Air Force

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Civil Air Patrol my
dad introduced me to.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were giving pilot's
license to kids for free

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.460 align:middle line:84%
if you qualified and wanted
to be part of this thing.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's for people
also before they

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.990 align:middle line:84%
go into the military, so you
get extra rank before you go in,

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:90%
kind of like ROTC.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Which I did that too.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:90%
So you get all these perks.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So I got my pilot's
license really early age.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And I took the many tests
that I just know one thing.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I took a lot more tests
than everyone else

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:90%
did going into the military.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And they were not your
normal ASVAB test.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Give me an example
of something unusual as a test.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, you know an
ASVAB test is based off of what

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:90%
are you good at?

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.709 align:middle line:90%
Are you a good mechanic?

00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if he can figure
this sprocket or this chain.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.815 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe he's good at writing.

00:14:35.815 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, does he know a verb,
adjective, or linguistics?

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.939 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And that
might lead to your MOS,

00:14:39.939 --> 00:14:41.532 align:middle line:84%
that military
operation specialty.

00:14:41.532 --> 00:14:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Weed you
out to your MOS.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But with my stuff, it had
to do with geometric shapes.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah,
and like mandalas,

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:59.179 align:middle line:84%
and like out of the six,
which one do you like?

00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
which one do I like?

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it wasn't a test,
but it was a test for something.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously,
there's some sort

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:84%
of subliminal message
in there, maybe

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
some sort of encoding that I
don't know about that I have

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:90%
or my lineage has.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: These could be logos
of certain ET groups that they

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
might have been aware had
already contacted you?

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Exactly.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So that's how I got
pulled out of the Air Force

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
part after I did my 4 and 1/2
years and then still continued

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.175 align:middle line:90%
with the contract work.

00:15:29.175 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Had you already done
4 and 1/2 years in the Air Force

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:90%
before?

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I did 4 and 1/2,
and then two years reserve,

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and then two years
inactive, so total of four--

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:90%
8 and 1/2.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And it's after the
4 and 1/2 years that you got

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:84%
the salmon filets and
that whole thing started?

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The first time I got
the salmon filet was August 8th

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:52.010 align:middle line:90%
of 1991.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:90%
You're having these tests.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Now did these tests start all
the way back when you were 13?

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah it started
in the auxiliary part.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.954 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:16:01.954 --> 00:16:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So one of them
was geometric shapes.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.786 align:middle line:84%
Could you give me another
example of something

00:16:05.786 --> 00:16:08.340 align:middle line:84%
that was bizarre as
a test that you got?

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: There was a lot of
high-end physics and magnetic

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:17.850 align:middle line:84%
questions, which I really
didn't understand at that point.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:90%
But I scored high on it.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:90%
But really, that's not my thing.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So I had these amazing
job opportunities

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.740 align:middle line:90%
when I went in the military.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted
to be an F-15 Eagle

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:84%
pilot because I
just wanted to fly,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.779 align:middle line:90%
you know, Top Gun all the way.

00:16:31.779 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:84%
But the Army offered
me a huge scholarship.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I could not refuse to
fly Apache helicopters.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.630 align:middle line:84%
But all flight-related,
you see, going

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.150 align:middle line:84%
towards probably being
an astronaut, or NASA,

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:90%
or space-related stuff.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Most pilots, most
astronauts, as you know,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
which it's now
changed because they

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:51.347 align:middle line:84%
need scientific technicians
for that specialty.

00:16:51.347 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I became
like a payload specialist.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:90%
So getting back to why.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I was just so adamant that
I was going to be a pilot,

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.260 align:middle line:84%
being just a kid you know,
16 year-old when I signed up,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.310 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm making these decisions.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, you can
also do this medical stuff.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:90%
and I loved, you know--

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I loved going to the doctor
and seeing all the stuff.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I liked watching them cut
out my ingrown toenails.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't hurt so
much playing soccer.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.470 align:middle line:90%
So it amazed me.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.815 align:middle line:90%
They're always like sit down.

00:17:26.815 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Son, you don't
want look at this.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:90%
There will a lot of blood.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.369 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, no,
no, I want to see it.

00:17:30.369 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're injecting
me, and they're

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:90%
like this kid is freaking weird.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And all these surgeons
too, and these doctors,

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:84%
when I was really young
ended up becoming my friends.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And I end up becoming
their teachers

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
because you know I
got CME accredited

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:84%
to teach them on the platelets,
plasma, and stem cells.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:90%
It was a really funny circle.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What is
CME accredited?

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Physicians, and
nurses, and all medical people,

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:01.190 align:middle line:84%
in order to keep your license,
you have to go to symposiums

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and get updated on new
educational properties.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So continuing medical
education units.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's get back to when you
are first brought to Sandia,

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
something you've

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:84%
told me before about the process
of how you got to the room.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with how
you get brought in.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Like what was the
first thing that you

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:84%
saw that would be
a lot different

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.060 align:middle line:90%
than a typical military--

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, being in the
operating room and working

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:41.460 align:middle line:84%
in emergency-type situations,
and already knowing pretty much

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
everything about
the human body--

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
in the accelerated program
I was in assisting surgeons,

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I knew that
when I walked into this place

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
that they had spent a lot
of money on everything.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Even the doors, the security
systems, these amazing security

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:90%
guards.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
The demeanor of the
scientists and physicians

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that were there, the
technicians and everyone,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.010 align:middle line:90%
it was very serious.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.420 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very organized.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:90%
And it was very clean.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And it took-- you
get debris first.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:90%
You know, they take you.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge background check,
but I'm already active duty.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Perfect for them.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Young.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:90%
If he messes up, who cares?

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Just get rid of him.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.530 align:middle line:84%
He died in a helicopter
crash, you know, whatever.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:90%
So perfect subject.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:90%
But super high IQ.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.432 align:middle line:90%
Very perfect.

00:19:45.432 --> 00:19:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Already has medical training.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.681 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what he can do.

00:19:47.681 --> 00:19:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So they brought me
in this room first.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And this was before I actually
went to do my first case.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.901 align:middle line:84%
And they just laid
it all out and--

00:19:55.901 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Laid what out?

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Laid
these contracts out.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was so thick.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:02.430 align:middle line:90%
And I was--

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Like you're expected
to read all that as you sit

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make sense.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.643 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, of
course, I didn't read it.

00:20:07.643 --> 00:20:09.720 align:middle line:90%
I was 19 years-old.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.940 align:middle line:90%
I saw the page.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:90%
I already signed up.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I was already stupid
enough to sign up

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:90%
to get into the military.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:90%
So, come on.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's like-- you know,
which I love, by the way,

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:90%
the military.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And they saved my life
as much as made me

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:84%
who I am today, so I'm a huge
supporter of the military,

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:84%
still am to this day with
other projects and things.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't mean to make
it sound like I'm not.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.937 align:middle line:90%
I was really thankful for that.

00:20:36.937 --> 00:20:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: But we're very
thankful for the Alliance

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that they're
turning the tables for us.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I know.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: It's amazing.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It is.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:90%
All the white hats coming out.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And we
need people like you.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.350 align:middle line:84%
We need people like
you to be brave enough

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:84%
to speak to the truth and
say what they experienced.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.047 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Well I'm hoping once--

00:20:53.047 --> 00:20:54.630 align:middle line:84%
because I know a lot
of these people--

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.374 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping once they
see me come forward,

00:20:57.374 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I really believe there's
going to be a lot more come

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.387 align:middle line:90%
forward like within the year.

00:21:01.387 --> 00:21:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: It's going
to get easier too

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.090 align:middle line:84%
because the cabal's being
greatly defeated right now.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And you have had a lot
of briefings about that

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.931 align:middle line:84%
as well, which we can get
into in later episodes.

00:21:08.931 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Sure, yeah.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So you get
all these documents--

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.471 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I signed the book,
and they make it very officious,

00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:84%
like all these people,
the cool lab coats,

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:90%
and other security people.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.484 align:middle line:84%
But not in their
normal black ops.

00:21:24.484 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:84%
They're in like clean
suits, like really

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:29.570 align:middle line:90%
cool, white, tactical stuff.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Like jumpsuit
kind of things?

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.688 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah,
like a flight suit.

00:21:32.688 --> 00:21:37.311 align:middle line:84%
White, but with a lot of cool
straps and not normal guns.

00:21:37.311 --> 00:21:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
can use guns down

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:84%
there because of the pressurized
systems, is what I was told.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was always told
never to bring my weapon

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.680 align:middle line:90%
into the facility.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:84%
You use a locker
room at the top.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.754 align:middle line:84%
You basically
change into scrubs,

00:21:52.754 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
then go down, and
change into your suit.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's like two
change-out stations.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And you wore a band,
which was the coolest thing

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.970 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:90%
And this band felt like silicon.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I later found out it was
graphene, and it glowed.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And that recorded everywhere
I went on the facility.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:90%
And they take it from you.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:90%
And it also activated later on.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:84%
They had iPads back then that
make these iPads look like a--

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, thin as--

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:84%
you know the X-ray film,
how flimsy that is?

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: You know or
the films from the--

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.395 align:middle line:84%
we used to use on
the projectors?

00:22:34.395 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: OK, imagine that
being an iPad, and flimsy,

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and being completely lit up,
and accessing the entire main

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:84%
database of whatever section you
were working in, and locating

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
your supervisor if
you needed to on--

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
everyone kind of knew
where everybody was.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Nowhere to hide or
sneak anything out.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.890 align:middle line:84%
You had this cool iPad
that was always with you.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.455 align:middle line:84%
And you used it for data
entry for all the stuff

00:23:06.455 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:84%
you do because
everything's documented.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.496 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: If it's so flopsy,
how would you be able to type

00:23:10.496 --> 00:23:11.300 align:middle line:90%
on it?

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, that's easy.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Everything was with your
finger, and they had a stylus.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And the stylus looked
like a thermometer.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And it had a very
grippy texture to it.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And you could hold it, this
flimsy-- it's not that flimsy.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
stronger than that.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:90%
But like that kind of material.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like a special
polycarbonate

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:84%
that I think it was infused,
of course, with probably

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:43.430 align:middle line:84%
graphene or some other
something photovoltaic,

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:90%
obviously, to do all this stuff.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, it would always
be down on something.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not a text paper, OK.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:84%
This something was where it
is always on your counter,

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
you're using your little thing,
your finger, or whatever,

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and it also interlocks
into other--

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:08.307 align:middle line:84%
every room has like a hub,
like you plug your iPhone into.

00:24:08.307 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, this thing, when you
lay it down on a table,

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.860 align:middle line:90%
the whole table now knows this.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh wow, that's cool.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.491 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So it's just like
this Bluetooth-type energy.

00:24:17.491 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: And it's full color.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, oh
brilliant full color.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Three-dimensional objects.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:90%
You can--

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:24.959 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh, holographic too.

00:24:24.959 --> 00:24:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Holographic too.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Especially when you
put it on the tables,

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:35.350 align:middle line:84%
the tables become like
the actual 3D part

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.630 align:middle line:90%
of whatever you're presenting.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So If
I did get a body,

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's already been
3-D scanned, the body,

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that can be projected
above the table.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you can move
it with your hands.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can say,
hey, so I don't know

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:90%
what this is here in the body.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:90%
We want just this.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So cause the least
amount of damage

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:03.130 align:middle line:84%
to get just this organ
or this little BB out.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very-- and
that just turned me on.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I was a techie,
and I was young,

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want
to ever mess up.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.940 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to keep going.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And at
the time, right?

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.000 align:middle line:84%
The time window you're
describing, all we had

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.774 align:middle line:84%
was like these desktop tower
computers that were ridiculous.

00:25:21.774 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: My goodness.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:90%
We had the big bulky--

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if
Apple even came out,

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.190 align:middle line:90%
even had their comeback yet.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.480 align:middle line:90%
They just were.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So the wrist band, the
little iPad floppy thing

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.140 align:middle line:84%
was a very important thing
that's always kind of with you.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Could you roll it
up and keep it in your pocket?

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Or how would you carry
the little floppy iPad?

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, you don't have
anything on you ever but this

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:90%
band and this piece of paper.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't have any--
you can't have a watch,

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:84%
can't have a piece of
jewelry in this facility.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything has been
stripped from you when

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:90%
you do your two change-outs.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Corey on this show has
talked about a smart glass pad.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds a lot like
what you're describing.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:90%
What was it called?

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Did they ever have
a name for it?

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It always
just called the folder.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: The folder.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.864 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, the folder.

00:26:12.864 --> 00:26:15.510 align:middle line:84%
There was no fancy like
Star Trek name or anything.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, a lot of times
it seems like to, as they call

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.466 align:middle line:84%
it, reduce
psychological impact--

00:26:19.466 --> 00:26:20.265 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:26:20.265 --> 00:26:22.855 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: They try to give
you these conventional things.

00:26:22.855 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: That makes sense.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.614 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Right, so
it's just a folder.

00:26:25.614 --> 00:26:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Don't forget
your folder and your band.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.327 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Did the band do
anything else besides just

00:26:31.327 --> 00:26:32.126 align:middle line:90%
glow?

00:26:32.126 --> 00:26:33.270 align:middle line:90%
You said it glowed or--

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.652 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, every now
and then, it would glow.

00:26:35.652 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it was just
because someone

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:40.230 align:middle line:84%
was accessing your
whereabouts, especially when

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:41.952 align:middle line:90%
there's breaches.

00:26:41.952 --> 00:26:43.410 align:middle line:84%
There was a couple
of breaches when

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I was there of things escaping.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a
scientist technician like me

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that did try to take some
stuff out of the facility.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And when that thing
glows a different color,

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:84%
there's like different
colors for different things.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, just do not
move and don't go anywhere

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.990 align:middle line:90%
until whatever is--

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:90%
the emergency is going on.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Like in hospitals, we
have code red and code

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:90%
blues, and all that stuff.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.610 align:middle line:90%
It's similar to that, that not--

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.581 align:middle line:84%
you know what to
do or not to do.

00:27:16.581 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What were some of the
colors that you can remember

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:90%
and what they meant on the band?

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Red means
you better not move.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Just don't
even move at all.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Blue is
everything's fine.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:31.830 align:middle line:84%
There was one yellow,
which means breach.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Contamination breach.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, not just--
no, not like someone stole

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.080 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Someone somehow had a
hole in their suit or--

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:43.490 align:middle line:84%
because you have to understand
these things have viruses.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:84%
They have bacteria that
we don't even know.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:90%
It can kill you.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.810 align:middle line:90%
It could mutate.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Last thing you want is that out.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So they have these artificial
intelligence systems in place,

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and these super high scrubbers,
and like the most amazing

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.810 align:middle line:84%
disinfecting type
of air handlers

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.820 align:middle line:90%
you would not even believe.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And even walking through
some of these things

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:84%
when you have your change
out didn't hurt or anything,

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:12.732 align:middle line:84%
but it was just a
precautionary thing.

00:28:12.732 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But they have these vents
in the systems that pick up

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:84%
on all particles,
parts per million,

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and it could tell if like one
small cold virus bacteria,

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:84%
got into a vent, and
goes and hits the thing.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.744 align:middle line:84%
It's like everything gets
shut down immediately.

00:28:30.744 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: And that's yellow?

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: That's yellow.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: On the band?

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so you didn't
want to see yellow.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Do you think that the
band could tase you or kill you

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.600 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't move
when it was red?

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I had never felt
threatened by that band at all.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Describe to me what
a breach means.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.620 align:middle line:90%
What did somebody do?

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Well, one time--

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:84%
this is just from now, I
can only say second hand.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.980 align:middle line:84%
I'll always tell you
it was me talking

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.600 align:middle line:90%
first hand or second hand.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Second hand means
these alarms went off.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we were later
debriefed that someone

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.130 align:middle line:90%
tried to take something out.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:11.420 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what it is.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I really was not allowed
to ask what it is.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.140 align:middle line:84%
But that's what happened to
ease everybody's calmness.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So everyone can start
focusing again better.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It's nerve-wracking if
you hear any alarm there.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So you never found
out what any of these breaches

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.800 align:middle line:90%
really were?

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.175 align:middle line:84%
They just give
you a very vague--

00:29:29.175 --> 00:29:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: One breach I did
because my really close

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.650 align:middle line:84%
friend's husband was one
of the security guys.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:43.630 align:middle line:84%
So they did have... made
an awesome hybrid bear-type

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.507 align:middle line:90%
osseo-integrated being.

00:29:47.507 --> 00:29:49.423 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I don't know
really what that means.

00:29:49.423 --> 00:29:50.547 align:middle line:90%
Could you be more specific?

00:29:50.547 --> 00:29:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They made a hybrid
animal of some sort that

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.770 align:middle line:90%
resembled a giant grizzly bear.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: OK, but
it was human-like?

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: But it had metal--

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:01.810 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
But it had like metal talons
made of some amazing--

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.615 align:middle line:84%
it was osseo-integrated
into his bone structure.

00:30:09.615 --> 00:30:12.030 align:middle line:84%
That means the
titanium and tissue--

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:12.830 align:middle line:90%
or whatever metal.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.163 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what the metal was.

00:30:14.163 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm hypothetically
just hypothesizing.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:84%
All I know is once it got
out, they had a special truck

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.260 align:middle line:90%
to get this thing.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean it got to the surface.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.250 align:middle line:90%
It's going across the desert.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, very fast.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So they had to
blow this thing up,

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and it was so indestructible
that they only injured

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:84%
it, and then was able to put
it into this special truck.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And the truck steel was
eight inches thick, the cargo

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:43.610 align:middle line:90%
container.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:44.443 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Good lord.

00:30:44.443 --> 00:30:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And the marks in
it were four inches deep.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:50.884 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: From that
thing trying to whatever.

00:30:50.884 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:84%
It was probably trying to
get-- after they knocked it out

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.160 align:middle line:90%
So he was there on that.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.302 align:middle line:84%
And he saw the marks
in the truck as well.

00:31:01.302 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: That's crazy.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.676 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And you
know, he would--

00:31:03.676 --> 00:31:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I consider him a
very honest person.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Plus, it was all over.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knew about it.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knew there was bad-bad.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was from a different
genealogy department

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.902 align:middle line:90%
on the base.

00:31:15.902 --> 00:31:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, I hate to
leave you on a cliffhanger,

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.810 align:middle line:84%
but that's all the time
we have in this episode.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting story.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.379 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pick up more
of this as time goes on.

00:31:24.379 --> 00:31:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for watching.
