00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we're with John Ramirez,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:10%
a retired CIA officer who served
as Chief of the Electronic

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:10%
Intelligence Branch and
specialized in ballistic

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.670 align:middle line:10%
missile defense,
weapon systems radar,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:10%
and technical
collection operations.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Today, he shares
his perspectives

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:90%
on the Galactic Federation.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:90%
John, welcome to the show.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Israel's former space
security chief Haim Eshed has

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:84%
stated that extraterrestrials
do exist and there's a Galactic

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Federation and that they're
waiting for us to make contact

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:90%
and get prepared for that.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.260 align:middle line:84%
What do you have
to say about that?

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never heard of a
Galactic Federation while I was

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:90%
in CIA itself.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:10%
I would add that Mr. Eshed is
just more than a counterpart

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.360 align:middle line:10%
to NASA administrator.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.390 align:middle line:10%
He's more like the counterpart
to the director of the National

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:10%
Reconnaissance Office
and in that sense,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:10%
he's tied to the Israeli
Intelligence Service.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300 align:middle line:84%
He did claim that and he
claimed that our president

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:90%
at the time--

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.420 align:middle line:84%
President Trump--
knew all about it,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:84%
but that we were not ready
to make that type of contact

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:90%
with the Galactic Federation.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:10%
Humanity wasn't ready and that
humanity must be prepared,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:10%
but those comments
also dovetail nicely

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:10%
with what former Canadian
Defense Minister Paul

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:10%
Hellyer has also said about
the existence of a Galactic

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:10%
Federation.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, going back to CIA,
there was a remote viewer

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Mel Riley.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:10%
He's now deceased, and
his remote viewing session

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:10%
was facilitated
by Major Ed Dames.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:10%
And in this remote
viewing session,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.060 align:middle line:10%
where Mr. Riley did
not know the target,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:10%
he described a
Galactic Federation.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:84%
He described his experiences
of being led into a cave

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and meeting various beings
and seeing a platform that he

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
was then placed on and
having these other beings

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:90%
surround him.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And that these beings were
from the Galactic Federation.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, say what you will
about remote viewing,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
but in many instances,
there was success

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:90%
ratio with the remote viewing.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It just wasn't consistent enough
to be a source of intelligence,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.250 align:middle line:90%
but in informed intelligence.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And so, on that
basis, I would say

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.655 align:middle line:84%
that there is some truth to
perhaps what Mr. Eshed has

00:02:46.655 --> 00:02:49.790 align:middle line:84%
said, also what Mr.
Hellyer has said,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and what Mel Riley reported
in his remote viewing notes.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.800 align:middle line:84%
- Do you know who might be the
Galactic Federation members?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:90%
- I don't.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Again, this is all anecdotal.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
People have seen various
beings of certain archetypal

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
appearance and you
have the tall beings

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes called
the Tall Nordics.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.040 align:middle line:90%
You have shorter beings.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:90%
You have Greys.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:10%
You have Reptilian beings,
Saurian beings that are not

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:10%
harmful, they were
very friendly,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:10%
but then, there are people
that report Saurian beings

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.220 align:middle line:10%
or Reptilian beings who
are not exactly malevolent,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:10%
but they don't have the
very best bedside manner.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be aggressive and
they tend to be antisocial.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, at least,
these beings have

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
been seen, along with
the Mantis beings,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:84%
on the planet by
various experiencers.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And whether they constitute all
of the Galactic Federation, who

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:90%
knows?

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but
perhaps, these beings

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.790 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who are
somewhat authorized,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I would say, by the
Galactic Federation

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.660 align:middle line:90%
to make more direct contact.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps because they
had some prior contact,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.340 align:middle line:84%
prior to humans arrival, and
that they've been on the planet

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Have any agencies categorized
these species that you've been

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:90%
mentioning?

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:10%
- I don't have direct knowledge
of that, other than anecdotes

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:10%
that there are these
various other beings working

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.210 align:middle line:10%
with the US government.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:84%
When I say government, I
actually mean to say perhaps,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
the military services,
not necessarily

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:90%
the intelligence community.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I've heard Navy and
I've heard Air Force.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:84%
- Are they all
exchanging freely,

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:84%
this information that the
agencies and military find out

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.020 align:middle line:90%
on their own?

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>> What I was told, and again,
I must stress that these are

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.070 align:middle line:84%
anecdotes told to me,
unsubstantiated so I have no

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
direct knowledge, but what I was
told was that they're helping

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:84%
us to derive the technology
and adapt it for human use.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:90%
Then, whenever--

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And who has
control over that?

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Basically, they do.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>> They decide
where that goes too?

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, it's their
technology and again,

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
it goes back to substantiating
anecdotes of cooperation with

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:90%
these beings.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
That there was some agreement
made with these beings

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:84%
that they will then help us
with some of the technology

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:90%
and adapting it for human use.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was also told that
the technology is not really

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
a weapons system
per se, but mostly,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
something we call an ISR,
or Intelligence Surveillance

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Reconnaissance Platform.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of craft
that is able to travel

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:84%
to any point in the
world very quickly

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and have persistent coverage
of that area of the world

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.970 align:middle line:90%
and not be seen at all.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> How quickly when
you say quickly?

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>> You didn't know.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:90%
They didn't tell me.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.505 align:middle line:90%
>> The instant is a--

00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>> More than, like, a satellite
can get there and a satellite

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:90%
travels--

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.425 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very quick.

00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> --at 18,000 miles per
hour in low-Earth orbit,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:90%
but faster than that.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And the persistent coverage,
without being seen,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.260 align:middle line:90%
are like the goals of ISR.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:84%
That is the golden nugget
that ISR strives to achieve.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:90%
And so you hear about the TR3B.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard of
a TR3B, I've heard

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
of a TR1, which is an
enhancement of the U-2

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:84%
aircraft, and I've
heard of the TRX, which

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
is the next generation
of the U-2 aircraft.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:10%
TR means Tactical
Reconnaissance.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And I never heard
of a TR2, which

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:84%
should have preceded a TR3, and
I don't know if a TR3B exists,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
but I do believe that there
is some type of ISR craft that

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
does exist, that is aerospace--
not space, but aerospace-- that

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:84%
flies in Earth's
atmosphere or slightly

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.190 align:middle line:84%
above Earth's atmosphere and
is able to conduct that ISR

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.470 align:middle line:90%
mission for the Pentagon.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> While this craft is
in the exoatmosphere,

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:90%
is it manned or unmanned?

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I was led to believe that
it is completely unmanned.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:84%
That we could not
pull the acceleration

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:84%
these craft are able to do
with a human on board, which

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:90%
will limit it to 9.5, 10 Gs.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
That they're much
faster and that we've

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:36.235 align:middle line:84%
seen craft that can move and
accelerate as several hundred,

00:07:36.235 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:84%
if not more, Gs, which
would kill a human.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe
they're manned in any way.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> But if they are 85,000 feet
or higher with zero gravity,

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:90%
how would that play a role in?

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have to get there,
first and so you have to get

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:84%
from the ground up there or
even if you're launched from

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
a high-altitude plane, I know
we launch a lot of these craft

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:90%
from the B-52--

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>> --you still need
to get up there.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.047 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're not
always up there,

00:08:07.047 --> 00:08:10.780 align:middle line:84%
just like a satellite
rotating around the Earth.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%
These are things that can
be launched tactically or--

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>> And fly.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>> And fly.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And fly and maneuver.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:10%
And having said that, there is
one craft that is a collection

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:10%
platform, also a scientific
collection platform,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:10%
and that is the X-37B.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:10%
An X-37B is able to sustain
its mission for hundreds

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.987 align:middle line:10%
and hundreds of days
at a time before having

00:08:34.987 --> 00:08:37.570 align:middle line:10%
to come back down to the Earth
and that's completely unmanned.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So that is used for
scientific experiments,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
it's also used as a
sensor platform as well,

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.200 align:middle line:84%
but these craft are
not exactly the X-37B.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.220 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Long before Paul
Hellyer and Haim Eshed

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:84%
spoke about the
Galactic Federation,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
individuals out there also spoke
of the Galactic Federation.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to find out,
where is that going to lie--

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.150 align:middle line:84%
with the individuals
or the military?

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:84%
What's your thought on
the Galactic Federation?

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's no question in
my mind that it rests with

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
the individual because if
you look at the government,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:84%
with a big G, it's amorphous,
kind of in the shadows,

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:84%
but the government
is made up of people.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've related before
that the people I have met

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:84%
have had these experiences
and have had encounters

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:84%
with messages of hope and
these are just people who

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle line:90%
happen to work in government.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's important
that the power rests

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:90%
with the people.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's the
people who then elect

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.220 align:middle line:90%
the government to represent us.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it takes,
like, everyone to be convinced.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
certain amount of people

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:01.160 align:middle line:84%
that will reach a certain level,
where they become influencers

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:90%
and cascade outward.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.620 align:middle line:84%
That it will become more
and more accepted by people

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and because it's
accepted by people,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
the government
listens to the people.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think the individual
has more information about this

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.560 align:middle line:84%
or the governments
at this point?

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I think the individuals do.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that
because individuals

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:10%
have had personal
experiences dealing

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:10%
with various non-human
intelligences.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>> But the government still
is covering up non-human

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:90%
intelligences.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, because I don't
believe that they want that

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:90%
to be revealed at all.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> What's to say they
wouldn't want to be in control

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.570 align:middle line:84%
of the Galactic Federation,
the information coming through?

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> They have very little control
over the Galactic Federation

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:84%
because the Galactic
Federation, if it exists,

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:90%
can show up on their own accord.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:84%
They don't need permission
to show up and they're not.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Every time people have witnessed
these craft in the air,

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:90%
they didn't ask for permission.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Tic Tac didn't
ask for permission

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:13.460 align:middle line:84%
to play around with the Nimitz
battle group, it just did it,

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
the way it's going

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.790 align:middle line:90%
to go with Galactic Federation.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.610 align:middle line:84%
If they choose to
appear, they will appear,

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and no government can stop
them, and no government

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.140 align:middle line:90%
can encourage them.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But it really depends on
the awareness by people

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
just one person.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just the family
of that person,

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:90%
the friends of that person.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
If that person decides
to become public,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%
they would become
public, and in spite

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.470 align:middle line:84%
of the ridicule
that they may face,

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:84%
they have strong convictions to
share what they've experienced.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the real power
and the strength of that.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the government
pays attention to that.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.890 align:middle line:84%
There's an awareness not
beyond the censored data

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.170 align:middle line:84%
that the government may
collect through satellites

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:84%
or whatever means,
technical means,

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I think there's an awareness
and monitoring what people say.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I would not doubt that there
are members of the government

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:84%
watching me right now and
that's a way of-- that

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:90%
we're influencing--

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>> --the government and places
like Gaia is a great way

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.180 align:middle line:84%
of sharing information
with those people.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, I have high confidence
that as individuals become

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
less stigmatized
about what they know,

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:84%
that this awareness
will grow and that

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:84%
is the key element of
why the legislation is

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.080 align:middle line:84%
so important because we
need to de-stigmatize

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
this phenomenon with those
in government, who serve

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:84%
in the military, or in the
intelligence community,

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and going beyond
that, de-stigmatize it

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.130 align:middle line:84%
to those professions who have
encountered this phenomenon.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
commercial pilots--

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>> --and others
who have seen this,

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:84%
but they don't want
to say anything.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:84%
But as people start
talking about it

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and sharing their
experiences, I think

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.540 align:middle line:84%
that we'll reach a threshold
where the government will then

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:84%
say, OK, we need
to talk about it.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:84%
We need to have a
conversation about this.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It has to be addressed.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It has to be addressed.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned
extraterrestrials working with

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:90%
the United States.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible or do you know of
any extraterrestrials that are

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:90%
working with other countries?

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, even the fact that
they might be extraterrestrials,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know that.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, I said, these are
anecdotes unsubstantiated.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, the ones
you mentioned.

00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:38.635 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:13:38.635 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and so I would think
that would be of interest

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:90%
to the US government.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:84%
If they are working
with US government,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and that's a big if, we'll
be interested to know,

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.150 align:middle line:84%
are they also working
with our adversaries?

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And if they are working
with our adversaries, what

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:90%
is the agenda?

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Why are they working
with our adversaries?

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:84%
How about the military
industrial complex,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that's pretty compartmentalized,
that sells both weapons to,

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.450 align:middle line:84%
let's just say, both
sides of the planet here.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Are they also a little bit
above the CIA and government,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.150 align:middle line:90%
in terms of secrecy?

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if they're a defense
contractor and they got

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:84%
their contract to the
process known as the Federal

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Acquisition Regulation, they
are beholden to the federal

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
government, to the
executive branch,

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and oversight can be conducted
over them through the executive

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:90%
branch sponsor.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an Air Force
contractor, for example,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and they're working on this
advanced technology that

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
purportedly came from
non-human intelligences

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and if they got one
dime, I would even

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.650 align:middle line:84%
say one penny, of
taxpayers' money,

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:90%
they are subject to oversight.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is known
to the executive branch

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:90%
and to the legislative branch.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard to hide
a program like that,

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:84%
but having said that,
the government can

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:09.460 align:middle line:84%
sell a program to a defense
contractor for very little

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:90%
money and I mean, like, $1.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:90%
It's all yours.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Bill of sale, let's sign it.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, our hands
are wiped clean,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
our hands meaning the
government's hands

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:84%
are wiped clean,
and you go ahead

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and use your own internal
research and development

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.700 align:middle line:84%
money to do whatever you
want to do with that.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:10%
And don't tell us
anything because if you

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.650 align:middle line:10%
tell us anything,
then we reconnect

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:10%
that established connection
with the government

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.870 align:middle line:10%
and it's no longer, like,
out of oversight reach.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So you do your thing
in secret and you

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
develop it and you
test it, just don't

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:84%
let us know about
it, until you're

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:90%
ready to sell it back to us.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to be
coming back at that $1 rate.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:10%
And I use that $1 because
in my personal experience,

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:10%
we actually sold some technology
to a contractor of CIA,

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:10%
and it was a type of
recording equipment--

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:10%
a commercial recording device--

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:10%
which was actually used to
playback data tapes collected

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:10%
by internal satellites, so this
intelligence contractor for CIA

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:10%
actually used that equipment
and instead of bringing it back

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:10%
to headquarters, we
sold it to him for $1,

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:10%
and then, they sold it to a
Public Broadcasting station

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.470 align:middle line:10%
for much more than $1, and
so that's how it's done.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:84%
We can actually sell
government-furnished equipment

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and we can transfer it
to the private sector

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and have a Bill of Sale
and wipe our hands clean

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and never, ever have any
interaction with that equipment

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
or whatever project the
defense contractor might

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:90%
want to do with it.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And as long as we keep
more than arm's length,

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:84%
like, just basically, an air
gap, that we don't want to know

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and don't tell us until you have
something that you can show us.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one way
of hiding a program.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And the Pentagon isn't
really equipped to do that.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.300 align:middle line:84%
They're Title X. It's
known as US Code Title

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:90%
X-- that's the Pentagon.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:90%
The CIA's US Code Title 50.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to transfer
a program and keep it secret

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.329 align:middle line:84%
and bury it to the point that
it never sees the light of day,

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.290 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon just needs
to transfer it to CIA

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and CIA has the legal
authority to hide that program

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:90%
and they do so.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Even from the government,
such as the president

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.360 align:middle line:84%
The president of
the United States

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:84%
is eligible to know everything
the president wants to know.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not hidden from the
president of the United States.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's probably
reported to a very small group

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.230 align:middle line:84%
of individuals in
the US Congress,

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:90%
known as the Gang of Eight.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's basically,
the speaker of the house,

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
it's the house minority leader,
it's the House Senate majority

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.930 align:middle line:84%
leader, Senate minority
leader, and the chair and vice

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.260 align:middle line:84%
chair of the
Intelligence Committee

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and the Defense Committee--
the Armed Services Committee.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So those eight
individuals do know.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:10%
And also, within the House
Appropriations Committee,

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:10%
there is a Defense
Subcommittee that

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:10%
is cognizant of all black
budgets in the US government.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:90%
So they know, as well.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So through your entire
career and experience,

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
you've never heard of a
president that requested

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.410 align:middle line:90%
information--

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:84%
let's say, for example,
what's in Area 51

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:84%
or any of these
classified places, bases--

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:90%
and been denied?

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>> They can't deny the president
any information like that.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:84%
He has the
constitutional authority.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just saying, are you
aware of that ever happening?

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Because there are things--

00:18:53.338 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>> There are rumors about that.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Rumors about--

00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and it's my personal
belief that these rumors were

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
started in order to protect the
president from any possibility

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that other people think he
knows more than what he says.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So he can say "I
don't know anything"

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and still be truthful primarily,
because a president can

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:84%
be read to the fact of
level or fact about.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
The basic information
about a program

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.808 align:middle line:84%
without going into who's
doing it, how much it costs,

00:19:23.808 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
where is it being
done at, and what's

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:84%
the progress of this
particular project.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So at a very superficial
level, the president

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.600 align:middle line:84%
will know about the
existence of a program,

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.780 align:middle line:84%
without knowing the
details of the program.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you aware of the
president knowing of any

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.160 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial contact near
any military installations?

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I can say this.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I would say that if
there's any contact

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
by a non-human intelligence
with a foreign government,

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.850 align:middle line:90%
the president will know.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And I have personal experience
of such a communication

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:84%
happening, but that I can't
get into details about.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.690 align:middle line:84%
But, having said
that, there are ways

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:84%
to collect that information
from people in the intelligence

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:84%
community and from
within the military

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:17.130 align:middle line:84%
because there is a
discussion database

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:84%
server available
to people who want

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:84%
to share their
personal experiences

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.430 align:middle line:84%
with the phenomenon, as well as
their professional encounters

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
with their phenomena,
without any kind of ridicule,

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:90%
without any kind of retribution.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.650 align:middle line:10%
So that was set up under our
current D&I, Avril Haines,

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:10%
and this was mentioned
as well by Mr. Chris

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:10%
Mellon, who said that such
a sharing mechanism existed.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And he put it in a
context that the Air Force

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.220 align:middle line:84%
was going through that, to see
what Air Force personnel were

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:90%
sharing things.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is shared
within the community of--

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Air Force were
then putting pressure on those

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.380 align:middle line:84%
people and I believe he wrote an
article about how the Air Force

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.940 align:middle line:84%
is not being as forthcoming
as the other services.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you learn
about that program?

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> That, I would say,
through Chris Mellon,

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
through that article, and as
well as things that were shared

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:17.210 align:middle line:84%
to me, with me, that
there is such a thing.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And it makes sense
because it's almost

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:84%
like a follow on to something
called the users' group

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
that was set up during
my time, where we talked

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:84%
about technology,
but we also talked

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:middle line:84%
about everything
related to technology,

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:90%
including, like, UFOs, UAPs.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.897 align:middle line:90%
>> It was called the users--

00:21:36.897 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>> The users' group.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.265 align:middle line:90%
>> The users' group.

00:21:39.265 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And how many people were
part of that users' group?

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Anybody with access to CIA's
computer system, which is,

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:84%
like, the entire employee
base of CIA could have gone

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.400 align:middle line:90%
into that.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the
most popular discussion

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:90%
forums at CIA.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know any CIA officers
that had direct contact with

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials that
you could share with us?

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I know of several.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:84%
One was not CIA, but he was NSA,
and he relayed an experience

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.130 align:middle line:84%
in his youth of seeing a craft
land, he and his brother,

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:90%
and being taken aboard.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't like to
share that with anyone,

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.450 align:middle line:84%
but because he knew I was
interested and he could trust

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.390 align:middle line:84%
me-- he was a colleague, an
NSA counterpart of mine--

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:84%
that he could
share that with me.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I also have a close friend, who
also had a direct experience

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:90%
with non-human intelligence.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> During the enlistment
or before the career?

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> During his career.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
He had an experience with
NHI, similar to what I have,

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
as well as others who
were public in talking

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%
to other podcasters
of their experience.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And I believe there
are many, many more

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:84%
that are waiting in
the wings, waiting

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.070 align:middle line:84%
for the right type
of environment

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:84%
for them to come out and say
these things in a public way.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Has anyone ever conveyed to
you about the extraterrestrials

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:16.600 align:middle line:84%
having fear of
working with humans?

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not necessarily a
fear, as much as a concern that

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.090 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials, the
non-human intelligence,

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.003 align:middle line:84%
are working with a certain part
of government and others are

00:23:29.003 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:84%
working with another
part of government,

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and there's probably more
competition than cooperation.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And that competition might
be very, very aggressive.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's the best way I
can describe that situation.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So the competition is
more on the human side

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and the different organizations
that are competing with each

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:84%
other when it comes
to the technology?

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I would say yes.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
uniformed services

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:84%
are very protective
of their own programs.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And I am not completely
certain that whatever the Air

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Force might be doing and
whatever the Navy might

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:84%
be doing are in
cooperation and there

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:90%
might be a lot of competition.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, there is a
competition for resources

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:15.790 align:middle line:84%
amongst the Armed Services for
just, regular mundane weapon

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So is the concern from
the extraterrestrials more

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:84%
of, maybe, they're losing trust
or they don't want to create

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.600 align:middle line:90%
conflict within the human realm?

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to me more
like conflict resolution.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't want to step
in the way and interfere,

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:39.440 align:middle line:84%
but they acknowledged that there
is this competitiveness amongst

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.220 align:middle line:84%
humans, amongst the
Armed Services of--

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that must make it very
difficult when sharing stuff

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:90%
to different organizations.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> In a way, that's another
way of hiding things.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.120 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
that cooperation,

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:59.510 align:middle line:84%
you're free to do a program in
complete absence of any input

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:84%
or any acknowledgment of anyone
else doing a similar program.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Who is actually delegating?

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And is it one entity of
extraterrestrial groups

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:84%
that says, well, the Navy gets
this, the Air Force gets that,

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:84%
or is it different
extraterrestrial organizations

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.950 align:middle line:84%
working separately with
these military organizations?

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's due to the
acquisition of that technology,

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.720 align:middle line:90%
who got there first.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So the Air Force probably
has older technology,

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:90%
going back to Roswell.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
If we assume that the
Roswell story is true,

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and I do believe that's true,
that the Army Air Force, which

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.280 align:middle line:84%
became the US Air Force,
has had that technology,

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:84%
but then we have
transmedium vehicles

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and the transmedium vehicles
were discovered by the Navy.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And so the transmedium
vehicles may

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:84%
represent a technology different
from what the Air Force has.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And it could be that
the technology exists,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:84%
but how that
technology was sourced

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and how it was acquired might
be the differentiation as to who

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.500 align:middle line:90%
competes and who cooperates.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.070 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
if the Air Force did

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
see one of these
transmedium vehicles

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and clock it or see it or
have it on sonar or radar

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't know
that they had that?

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:90%
That was seen by the Navy.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:33.083 align:middle line:84%
There, again, that could be
like one branch of the service--

00:26:33.083 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Even within the branch,
you could say, too.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Or within the branch,
hiding it from another branch.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, let the
Air Force believe

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:43.940 align:middle line:84%
that it is some strange
vehicle from outer space

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:90%
and let them go with that.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:84%
We know that where
it came from and so

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.980 align:middle line:84%
we're going to keep
silent about that,

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:84%
but I think that barrier will
be completely torn apart--

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I Agree.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> --eventually, especially if
new legislation goes forward,

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:84%
to force the various elements
of the Department of Defense

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.452 align:middle line:84%
to cooperate with each other
and the various elements

00:27:11.452 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:84%
of the intelligence community
to cooperate with each other.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And so the US Congress can
mandate that cooperation,

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.690 align:middle line:84%
where it doesn't exist,
because the Congress wants

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to know exactly what is
going on with these sightings

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:24.820 align:middle line:84%
that their constituents
are seeing.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Do we live in an
open or closed system?

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And what are the implications
of that opening, meaning

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:84%
that the extraterrestrials
and us have

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
a free flow of
information or is it

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:84%
controlled and only given to a
certain amount of organizations

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials, where
it doesn't go back and forth?

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you look
at human history,

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:46.957 align:middle line:84%
I think it started
with a closed system.

00:27:46.957 --> 00:27:47.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:47.757 --> 00:27:49.720 align:middle line:10%
>> That's why we have
priests and priestesses,

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.940 align:middle line:10%
who are in contact with
the beyond, let's say,

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:10%
but I think it's becoming
more and more open,

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:10%
as they become more and more
visible to ordinary people.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
What we see in
our skies, I mean,

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.510 align:middle line:84%
it's not just intelligence
community people seeing UAPs.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:84%
It's ordinary citizens all
over the world seeing them.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.690 align:middle line:10%
We have reports of
landings occurring,

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:10%
reports of crashes
occurring everywhere.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.750 align:middle line:10%
And so, I think
it's more open now.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:25.030 align:middle line:10%
It's not just exclusive to those
at certain levels of government

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:10%
and as this discussion
moves forward,

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:10%
it's going to be even more open.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.500 align:middle line:10%
So I believe it's an
open system and it's

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.820 align:middle line:10%
getting to be wide open.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
will happen shortly,

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.190 align:middle line:10%
as more and more
information comes through,

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:44.260 align:middle line:10%
but right now, I think there
are people behind the scenes who

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:10%
would prefer a closed system
because an open system would

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.570 align:middle line:10%
completely--

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:54.490 align:middle line:10%
completely dismantle
their entire worldview

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:55.420 align:middle line:10%
of what they think.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And they'd lose control
over that information.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only you lose control,
but there's a fear of being

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:02.920 align:middle line:90%
influenced.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.110 align:middle line:10%
>> And I don't use the
word influence or control.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I think that the non-human
intelligence are here

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.770 align:middle line:84%
to inspire us of
what we could be,

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.370 align:middle line:84%
if we didn't have all of
these petty kind of battles

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves, fighting
wars amongst ourselves.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.755 align:middle line:84%
They must look at us as, like,
primitive tribes fighting

00:29:20.755 --> 00:29:26.290 align:middle line:84%
each other for, like, little
parcels of land, for, like,

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:28.930 align:middle line:84%
no reason whatsoever
other than to say I'm

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:84%
putting my stake here
and this is my territory

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.493 align:middle line:90%
and you have to fight me for it.

00:29:34.493 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:84%
That's such a primitive
way of thinking.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping that with their
arrival, if they do arrive,

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:45.190 align:middle line:84%
shortly, I'm hoping
that we will finally

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:84%
come to the realization of
who we are, why we're here,

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and what our responsibilities
are to each other,

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.770 align:middle line:84%
to them, and to
our shared planet.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>> What other future plans
do you think they have, John,

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:90%
for humanity?

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:04.170 align:middle line:10%
>> I think they want us to
know what it's like to be

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:11.410 align:middle line:10%
a spacefaring nation and
to be explorers and to have

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:10%
technology that will help us
go beyond the kind of political

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.830 align:middle line:10%
and economic systems
that we have now,

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.230 align:middle line:10%
where we don't need money
and we don't need governments

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:28.400 align:middle line:10%
because we're all in concert
with helping each other.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there other influences
from NIHs other than

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:90%
the Galactic Federation members?

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I would think
that if they're here,

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.060 align:middle line:84%
they will be part of
the Galactic Federation.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that they're here
independently because I think--

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>> They're not like ambassadors
or contractors on the side.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's--

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is
concern of interfering

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.970 align:middle line:84%
with human development,
that we do have free will

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.880 align:middle line:84%
to choose the path
we need to choose,

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.980 align:middle line:84%
but they're here to
give us guidance.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you think back
toward the religious beliefs

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.750 align:middle line:84%
of the planet going way
back to early civilization,

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:14.020 align:middle line:84%
it's always about
asking a higher divine

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:84%
being for guidance
through prayers,

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:21.350 align:middle line:84%
for example, and being
led by a class known

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:25.910 align:middle line:84%
as priests and priestesses of
what that guidance should be.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost,
like, that was then,

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.770 align:middle line:84%
but now, with our
more sophistication

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and knowing our place
in the solar system

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:38.055 align:middle line:84%
and the solar system's place
in our galaxy and the fact

00:31:38.055 --> 00:31:39.680 align:middle line:84%
that there are many
galaxies out there,

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.570 align:middle line:84%
we can't be so
territorial anymore.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, I believe
that in the future,

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:57.020 align:middle line:84%
we will learn to cooperate
with them because we will

00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge them and we'll
acknowledge our place

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.150 align:middle line:90%
and where we should be--

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:03.530 align:middle line:90%
standing alongside of them.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:04.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Working together in harmony.

00:32:04.822 --> 00:32:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Working together.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel
unfolding in the world,

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:12.040 align:middle line:84%
with all the challenges that
are happening at this time,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:84%
that this is connected to
the non-human intelligences?

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think the non-human
intelligences are causing any

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.220 align:middle line:90%
of our challenges.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.750 align:middle line:84%
These are human challenges
that we brought on ourselves.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:27.790 align:middle line:84%
What I would hope that as we
acknowledge their presence--

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.700 align:middle line:84%
in this case, "we" meaning
the government officially

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.370 align:middle line:90%
acknowledges their presence--

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that they will help us
with our challenges.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:39.040 align:middle line:84%
That we won't be
so self-absorbed

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.790 align:middle line:84%
that we need to solve all of
our problems by ourselves.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we do need that help.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But you said earlier, the
non-human intelligence are--

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.650 align:middle line:84%
they are working with us to
a certain capacity to further

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:53.910 align:middle line:90%
our technology, at least.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, but that
technology is what kind?

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.540 align:middle line:90%
It's military.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.310 align:middle line:90%
It's all military.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And so it might not
be a weapon system,

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.270 align:middle line:84%
but still, if it's a
reconnaissance craft

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.990 align:middle line:84%
of some sort, it has
a military purpose.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:84%
What I'm thinking about is
more toward understanding

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:13.180 align:middle line:84%
our own physiology,
understanding energy, energy

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:13.980 align:middle line:90%
sources--

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.960 align:middle line:84%
we're making some exciting
discoveries in fusion power.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll discover something
about propulsion, as well--

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.590 align:middle line:84%
but these little
technological advances,

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:30.630 align:middle line:84%
instead of helping us with new
ways of killing each other,

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:33.020 align:middle line:84%
helping us with new ways
of healing each other.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's all on our own.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>> That's our decision to make.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
pushing us toward that.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
allowed to push us toward.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's no discussions
about our place amongst

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.672 align:middle line:90%
the stars either?

00:33:46.672 --> 00:33:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>> With the government?

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, with the
extraterrestrials

00:33:49.088 --> 00:33:50.840 align:middle line:90%
and the government, any of--

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the
extraterrestrials certainly,

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.470 align:middle line:84%
aspire for us to advance
beyond this tribal warfare that

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:00.710 align:middle line:84%
we're conducting on the planet,
but they're not going to step

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.740 align:middle line:84%
in and force that
acknowledgment.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.660 align:middle line:84%
They're not going--
they're not here

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.810 align:middle line:90%
to heal us against our will.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:11.280 align:middle line:90%
We need to grow--

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.449 align:middle line:84%
We need to grow our
consciousness, as well.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:17.000 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
aspect of the phenomenon

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.820 align:middle line:84%
is one that's not
well understood.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I believe the government is
starting to understand it,

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:84%
as they explore what this
phenomenon is all about

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.630 align:middle line:84%
because it's not just like,
lights in the sky going

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:90%
extremely fast.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.219 align:middle line:84%
People who have
encountered the phenomenon

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.239 align:middle line:84%
have had profound
changes in their lives.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.330 align:middle line:84%
They've received
messages of hope

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:41.179 align:middle line:84%
and some have been
physically healed.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think that as the
government becomes aware,

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:50.600 align:middle line:84%
that this is another
facet of this phenomenon

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.170 align:middle line:84%
that the government will start
adopting that and exploring

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:56.360 align:middle line:84%
that, as well as
trying to figure out

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.000 align:middle line:84%
how to make things go fast
because I think that's where

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.110 align:middle line:90%
we're stuck right now.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.970 align:middle line:84%
People are so
obsessed with craft.

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> They're looking at
it as a Shamu show.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, show us-- give us a show,
do some tricks in the sky,

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.240 align:middle line:90%
and we need to get past that.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>> From your
personal experiences,

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.480 align:middle line:90%
why do they want to contact?

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I think we are their
children and as parents with

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:24.960 align:middle line:84%
children here on the planet, you
want the best for your child.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.110 align:middle line:84%
You want to give the child
the best opportunity.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.870 align:middle line:84%
You want to protect that
child to a certain extent,

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:32.760 align:middle line:90%
but you can't over-protect.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The child needs to know,
to learn, all about life

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and the pleasantness of life,
as well as the dangers of life.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think they give us
that free will to do so.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.350 align:middle line:84%
But just as a parent
would be concerned

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.320 align:middle line:84%
if the child has something
flammable, like matches,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and lighting things in the
house, the counterpart of that

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.940 align:middle line:84%
is us discovering
nuclear weapons.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that was the
line in the sand that they said,

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, the kids have
found the matches

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and they're lighting
the place on fire.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.420 align:middle line:90%
We need to intervene.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, to me, it
makes perfect sense

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.890 align:middle line:84%
that Roswell happened
where it happened.

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:17.870 align:middle line:84%
The 509 Bombardment Group
was the only component

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:84%
of the Army Air
Force, at the time,

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that could deliver a nuclear
weapon on their B-52's anywhere

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:25.570 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And the nuclear weapons were
made right around the corner

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.510 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:29.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Right around the corner.

00:36:29.635 --> 00:36:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And why do they
show up at places

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:90%
that have nuclear facilities?

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.320 align:middle line:84%
The Navy sees them all the time,
but we have to keep in mind

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that submarines carry
nuclear weapons, as well.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are
nuclear power plants

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.990 align:middle line:84%
on many of the modern ships,
like aircraft carriers.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:50.710 align:middle line:84%
The larger ships
are nuclear powered.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:55.240 align:middle line:84%
There's the story about
the non-human intelligences

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:90%
appearing at our ICBM bases--

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:00.580 align:middle line:90%
these missile basis.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.570 align:middle line:90%
Why are they there?

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.180 align:middle line:84%
They want to
demonstrate that we're

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.190 align:middle line:84%
going to take the
matches away from you

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:11.230 align:middle line:84%
and they did so, at
Malmstrom on March 16, 1967.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:13.160 align:middle line:84%
They took some
matches away from us.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
I heard in Russia,

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.330 align:middle line:90%
they gave the matches to them.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.580 align:middle line:90%
So what does it feel like?

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.240 align:middle line:84%
You have a first
strike capability.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.660 align:middle line:90%
That's your doctrine.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Your doctrine is first strike
using your nuclear missiles.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to
turn them all on.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.240 align:middle line:90%
What does that make you feel?

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.660 align:middle line:84%
If, all of a sudden, you
lost control of the ability

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.800 align:middle line:84%
to not shoot and that anything
you do afterwards will shoot--

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.140 align:middle line:84%
in our case, we
have a counterstrike

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.030 align:middle line:90%
that will shoot when you shoot.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So our counterstrike
capability of ability

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:49.100 align:middle line:84%
to respond to a Russian
first strike was taken away.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.290 align:middle line:84%
They did not actually
disassemble or in any way

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:58.190 align:middle line:84%
incapacitate the nuclear
warheads on the Minuteman IIs.

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:03.770 align:middle line:84%
What they did do was to make
them incapable of firing.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So, in fact, they
took the missiles out.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:06.860 align:middle line:90%
And that sends--

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:10.190 align:middle line:84%

educational purposes there

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.860 align:middle line:84%
of turning the notch
down a little bit for us.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and it was just
June of that same year,

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Malmstrom happened, that
President Johnson met with his

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.750 align:middle line:84%
counterpart, Alexei Kosygin,
of the Soviet Union and they

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.900 align:middle line:84%
talked about, maybe we need to
reduce the amount of nuclear

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.800 align:middle line:84%
weapons we have and that
culminated into the first

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
signed by President Nixon

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and President Leonid
Brezhnev of the Soviet Union.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So, in that sense, that's
a good lesson to learn.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I love your
perspective on this, John.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I think we have a
great trajectory

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and I do hope we all have
an educational learning
