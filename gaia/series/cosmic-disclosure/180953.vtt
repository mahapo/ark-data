00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hey, everybody.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Jay Weidner here, and we are
back today with Jason Rice,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:90%
continuing his narrative.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.191 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON RICE: Thank
you for having me, Jay.

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Last time that
we were talking to you,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:10%
you just finished deployment
on a planet you called

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:10%
Planet One, where
you were fighting

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:10%
these ferocious creatures.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And you described to us the
Darwinism of your situation

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and how they were
manipulating everybody--

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
the-- the Dracos and the cabal
were manipulating everybody

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
into creating a kind of New
World Order fascist state

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:84%
in a way, with a banking
system and a fiat money system,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and a society more like
what we would have in Europe

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:90%
and America today, I would say.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So let's talk about
the next place that you went.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:84%
You were being taken
from Planet One.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And did you go on a ship
and then go to Planet Two

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:90%
or receive new orders?

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything in
between that occurred

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.085 align:middle line:90%
that we should know about?

00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Nothing of
note in between.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:84%
When you're given the
orders to pick up and leave,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
everybody packs their stuff,
puts them on the shuttles,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and the shuttles go and
meet up with motherships.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And motherships take us
from one system to another.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Where that other system is and
how far it was between Planet

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.475 align:middle line:84%
One and Planet Two-- which the
name that I recall is Callidus

00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Three--

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea how
far apart they are.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:84%
It could be 1,000
light years, or it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.620 align:middle line:84%
could be from a stellar
standpoint right next door.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you got on a
shuttle and they took you

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:90%
to the mothership.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.354 align:middle line:84%
What did the
mothership look like?

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The
particular motherships

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:84%
that we used for
interstellar travel varied.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
There were cigar-shaped
ships, and there

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:90%
were wedge-shaped ships.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:84%
They were both capable
of interstellar travel.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it would have been
the larger cigar-shaped ship

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:84%
that we would have packed
up my unit on and all

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
of our assets and
gear and equipment,

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.180 align:middle line:84%
because the smaller
wedge-shaped ships were not

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.760 align:middle line:84%
specifically designed for a
large contingent of ground

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:90%
troops.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So how many troops were
inside this cigar-shaped ship?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Each of the
cigar-shaped ships

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:84%
had room for 2,000 to
3,000 ground troops.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Plus all the equipment?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Plus all their
gear and equipment.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: There must have
been massive like, uh,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:90%
eating facilities and--

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm,
cafeterias, workout areas,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
quarters for officers,
quarters for the enlisted,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:84%
anything that a division
of troops would need.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Again, very
closed quarters?

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the ground
troops, us ground pounders,

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
were isolated and kept isolated
from the naval personnel.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
We had our own section of
the ship that we operated

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and worked in, and we weren't
allowed outside of that area

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:90%
of the ship.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
If we did, we would be subject
to any number of things

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.225 align:middle line:90%
short of death.

00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do you have any idea
why that was happening?

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They wanted to keep
information compartmentalized.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:84%
If we had gotten
outside of our areas,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.440 align:middle line:84%
there was a chance that we
may have started snooping, OK,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:90%
where are we?

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.170 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.190 align:middle line:84%
What other information
do we have?

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
The other side of that
is that the agreements

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.170 align:middle line:84%
between the Cabal
and the Mars Germans

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:84%
required that the Navy
and the ground troops

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
were separated because there
were elements of the ground

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:84%
forces that the Cabal
didn't want the Mars German

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Navy to be aware of,
specifically the strategically

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
placed ammunitions,
or munitions,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
in the event of
the self-destruct.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you guys had
an, um, ancillary plan

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:84%
that if things got bad you
would destroy everything?

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's
correct, including

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:84%
the self-destruct protocol
buried within each

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:90%
of the nanites on each soldier.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Would the Germans--
if they found out about this,

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.665 align:middle line:90%
would they be not very happy?

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:37.165 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They probably
knew about it.

00:04:37.165 --> 00:04:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How long were you
on this cigar-shaped craft

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
before you arrived at the
next place you were going?

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I don't remember.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you called
this planet Callidus 3?

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm, Callidus 3.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And is that the name
that the indigenous people had

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:90%
for their planet?

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.023 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That was the
name that we called it.

00:04:53.023 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
When we first arrived,
there were about 4 billion

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:90%
inhabitants on the planet.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
This planet was about 4%
or 5% larger than Earth.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Gravity was comparable.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:84%
It was a little more
than standard Earth but

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
is still within acceptable
tolerance levels

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:90%
for us to adapt to.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Having the nanite
enhancements helped

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.510 align:middle line:84%
because it strengthened
our bones and bodies

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.570 align:middle line:84%
where we needed to
have them strengthened.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, 4% or
5% isn't that much.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: When we first
arrived, another thing

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you about the planet
is that it had four moons.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:84%
They were all smaller
than Luna, Earth's moon.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:46.040 align:middle line:84%
We called them Moon 1, Moon
2, Moon 3, and then Moon 4.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.740 align:middle line:90%
Moon 1 was like a dark gray.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Moon 2 was like a white color.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Moon 3 was like a burnt orange.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And then black, so it was
the hardest to see and find.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why did these moons have
different colors, do you think?

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I believe it had
to do with the materials

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
that each of the these
bodies were composed of.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
The burnt orange, for instance,
was probably very high in iron.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The black was probably
more of a carbon.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:84%
The white was probably
some of the same material

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that you'd see on our
moon right here on Earth.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And the dark gray, your
guess is as good as mine.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Maybe--

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It could be a
granite or something.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Granite
or more titanium.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.595 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who knows?

00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:34.845 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So we want to talk
about the indigenous people.

00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What were they like?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.734 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The
indigenous population

00:06:37.734 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:84%
there numbered, again, about 4
billion when we first arrived.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:84%
The planet itself--
again, no salt water.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:90%
It was all freshwater.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.920 align:middle line:84%
It composed about 70% landmass,
and then the other 30%

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:90%
was the freshwater.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So it had a much larger
landmass than we're

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:90%
accustomed to here on Earth.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, started
seeing the pattern.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.650 align:middle line:84%
It was-- they were looking for,
just beginning their industrial

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
age, civilizations that they
were in, because that was where

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.090 align:middle line:90%
they were able to offer--

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
dangle the largest amount of
fruit in front of their eyes.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:84%
The people were shorter
than standard humans.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.440 align:middle line:84%
They didn't look much
different than humans

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.600 align:middle line:90%
you see here on Earth.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
The color of their skin
seemed to comprise mostly

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.626 align:middle line:90%
shades of white or olive.

00:07:35.626 --> 00:07:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And were they the only
inhabitants of this planet?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were
the only inhabitants.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Besides the
animals and things?

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
They did have some
livestock that they used.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Their cattle was much
shorter than the cattle

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:90%
that we would see here on Earth.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:90%
They were much more stockier.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you can
imagine a shorter cow

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:84%
with larger diametered
legs, kind of

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
like what you would expect to
see on an elephant, actually--

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were just
stockier necks, more squared

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.740 align:middle line:90%
off jaws and noses.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:90%
The goats that I saw--

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:90%
I call them goats.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was about
as close as you can

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.220 align:middle line:90%
get to what they looked like.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.010 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, again, they were
smaller, stockier, heartier,

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.140 align:middle line:84%
more squared than what we're
accustomed to seeing here.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Again, what
was the purpose

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.710 align:middle line:90%
of you being on this planet?

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Our purpose on this
planet was the same mission

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:84%
that we had on Planet One, which
was to help train the local

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:84%
indigs on how to
defend their planet,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
on training them how
to fight the invading--

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.931 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Hopefully not
the werewolves again.

00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Well, we weren't sure.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.230 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Again, intelligence was spotty,
and that was deliberate.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But we knew that the
opening stages would entail

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:90%
kinetic energy bombardments.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that was, for
us, our first telltale

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:90%
to be on the lookout for.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.170 align:middle line:84%
But we were there to fight
whatever it was that showed up.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Very similar scenario.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Very similar scenario.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So this is the SOP.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle line:84%
You're going to take a
certain kind of population,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.815 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to change it.

00:09:23.815 --> 00:09:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm, yep.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Into what
they want it to be.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Into what
they want it to be,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:84%
force them through attrition
of their own population

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:84%
to accept the terms
that are given to them.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Going back to Planet
One, from the time you started

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:84%
to the time you
finished, it would

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
be fair to say that the
entire culture of that planet

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:90%
had been altered forever.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Changed.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And so on Planet Two,
did the same scenario pan out?

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Same thing played out.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: On this planet, there
was an invader coming, just

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:90%
like the other scenario.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Just like
the other scenario.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And they
used kinetic weapons

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:90%
on the poles and everything?

00:09:59.050 --> 00:09:59.500 align:middle line:90%
Or what?

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They used
it on the poles

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:06.052 align:middle line:84%
to raise the sea level to
flood out the coastal cities.

00:10:06.052 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're thinking
it's the werewolves coming.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.426 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah, and
you're prepping for it?

00:10:10.426 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We're prepping for
it, and we're spreading out

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and defending our areas
and putting up the defenses

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and mines and trenches and
the defensive structures--

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.370 align:middle line:84%
you know, the typical
defensive technology

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:84%
that's employed by
the military using

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
some of the advanced tools
that we were allowed to use.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I will say that they limited
how much technology we

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.600 align:middle line:90%
could use with the indigs.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
They did not limit
the technology

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.125 align:middle line:84%
they use to defend the
division headquarters.

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:90%
So any time that they had--

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.804 align:middle line:84%
the brass was
threatened, they had

00:10:54.804 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:90%
no problem with pulling out.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the
signs that was, to me--

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's
a lot more going on

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
than some of the subtle
signs that you see.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So were you involved
in the first altercation

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.010 align:middle line:90%
with these invaders?

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I have not recalled
that I was involved with one

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.582 align:middle line:90%
of the first altercations that--

00:11:15.582 --> 00:11:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But you were
involved in an altercation.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: I was involved in many,
over the almost six-year period

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.135 align:middle line:10%
that I was there.

00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: So you fought on this
planet for almost six years?

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: 52 months.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: 52 months.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.300 align:middle line:84%
When they invaded, the
rumors and the intel

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:84%
began spreading about who
you were fighting against.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you knew before
your first altercation

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:90%
who you were fighting against?

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We knew before my
unit, my personal unit,

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
got involved in combat that
it was not the werewolves.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:90%
There was something different.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.635 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What was it?

00:11:48.635 --> 00:11:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We still had
no idea at this time,

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:84%
except that it was
quadrupedal, it was very fast,

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and it was about the
size of a grizzly,

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:06.230 align:middle line:84%
spiked around the neck, a large
mouth, and inhumanly fast.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And what kind of animal
creature was it, a robot?

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was a
created being, again.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.020 align:middle line:10%
And it seemed to comprise a
number of different systems

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:10%
from--

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:10%
probably crossbred from a
number of different lifeforms,

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:10%
taking whatever it
is that they needed

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.670 align:middle line:10%
to augment this particular
life form to fit the purpose

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.232 align:middle line:10%
and suit the needs
that they had.

00:12:31.232 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is there any creatures
on Earth that resemble?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.570 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.280 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine
a demon that's

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
got four legs and spikes
coming out of its neck

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
that travels in packs
in large numbers

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and can move about
the speed of a spider.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: A giant spider?

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.335 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Yeah, very fast.

00:12:54.335 --> 00:12:56.159 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And it was
built for combat?

00:12:56.159 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Built for combat.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Weapons?

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No weapons.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: No weapons.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Claws, teeth.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:01.996 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They were the weapon.

00:13:01.996 --> 00:13:03.866 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They were the weapon.

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It must have been
fairly easy, then, to them

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:84%
out as they were
approaching, right?

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Tell us about it.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: When you've got
an alien species that

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
seems to have some type of
embedded armor as its skin,

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:84%
small arms aren't
going to do it.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:10%
So you have to resort
to larger caliber, which

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.100 align:middle line:10%
means that standard humans--

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:10%
you're limited by
how much ammo you're

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:10%
going to be able to carry.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So again, you get to the
basic load out question.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:84%
How much are you going
to be able to carry?

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:84%
How much are you going
to be able to supply

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:90%
each person with?

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:10%
So it becomes, OK, we need
these larger weapons in order

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:10%
to take down this
particular enemy.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And in a lot of
cases, we ended up

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.420 align:middle line:84%
spreading around larger
crew served weapons.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of
having now 500 in a unit

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:84%
that are individual
fighters, you've got,

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:84%
say, 60% of that because
you're having to combine people

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:84%
into crew-served teams so
they can have a standing

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:84%
chance of being able to take
out this particular enemy.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So a large
percentage of the people

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:84%
were being used to carry
ammo and not really

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.505 align:middle line:90%
being able to be used in combat.

00:14:21.505 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.030 align:middle line:84%
You now have a
crew-served weapon

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:middle line:84%
that takes two or three
or sometimes four people.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.260 align:middle line:84%
That's one single firing point
instead of two or three or four

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.390 align:middle line:90%
separate firing points.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And that's because the
weapons that you were using

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.502 align:middle line:84%
had to be of a certain size in
order to defeat these things?

00:14:43.502 --> 00:14:44.460 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:10%
The weapons we were
allowed to use.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: So they limited that.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:84%
That was a particularly
bad sticking point.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:10%
At that point, I had
made Company Commander,

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:10%
and so I had a large
number of people

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.450 align:middle line:10%
that I was
responsible for, and I

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:10%
wanted to make sure
that I provided them

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.960 align:middle line:10%
with the best means possible for
defending themselves and being

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:10%
able to keep them alive.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:90%
And so I didn't like it.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was told on a
number of occasions,

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:84%
suck it up and do
what you have to do.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we got creative on how
we used the existing munitions

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
or ammunition in employing
them in the beginning stages.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Later on, when losses
started adding up

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and we were really
pushed against the wall,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:90%
they lightened up on that.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think it took losing
a couple of generals

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
before they were
able to do that.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you were
losing the war.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Oh, yeah.

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:10%
They didn't take any
prisoners, no POWs.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:10%
Again--

00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:59.975 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Fought to the death?

00:15:59.975 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Fought to the death,
would not be taken prisoner.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.220 align:middle line:10%
Again, it was a matter
of, they would not

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.655 align:middle line:10%
leave an area until every
life form was extinguished.

00:16:11.655 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You eventually
found some weapon that

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.910 align:middle line:90%
worked, then, against them.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It took antimatter.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Antimatter?

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Large antimatter
mass destruction bombs.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What--
describe that to me.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, part
of the issue--

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about
this with Planet One--

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:35.390 align:middle line:84%
is that the Navy were
responsible for defending

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.360 align:middle line:90%
the planet and the solar system.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And so what changed on
this particular planet

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:84%
was that the number
of Naval engagements

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
rose exponentially, which means
that the number of landings

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:90%
increased.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And these would
be the Mars German Navy.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.074 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:16:59.074 --> 00:17:00.275 align:middle line:90%
Our canners.

00:17:00.275 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.705 align:middle line:84%
And they were now losing battles
against these creatures also.

00:17:04.705 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Were taking higher
losses because they're--

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And that made them
get more serious about how

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.422 align:middle line:90%
they were going to fight back?

00:17:11.422 --> 00:17:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we
were able to start

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:84%
using antimatter explosives
and strategically placing them

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:84%
on our defensive
perimeters so that we

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:84%
could ambush any of
the invasions that

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.040 align:middle line:90%
would come in in the attacks.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So we would essentially
set up ourselves as bait

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
so that they would come
in in large numbers,

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:90%
and then we'd destroy them.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So ambush them.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Ambush them.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And describe
the antimatter weapons.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It has all
the flash and bang

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:55.000 align:middle line:84%
of a nuke without the bad side
effects of nuclear radiation

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.210 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:90%
And over a wide area?

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Over as large
an area as you want.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you can control how
much damage was being done.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yes, you
could have antimatter

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
that is the size of a
pea and take out a block,

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:84%
or you could have antimatter
that was a couple of pounds,

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and something that large
is going to take out

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:90%
multiple states-sized areas.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Could you take out
a planet with antimatter?

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No doubt.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:84%
You could destroy an
entire planetary surface

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.250 align:middle line:84%
with antimatter,
if you so desired.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: These creatures
that you were fighting,

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.612 align:middle line:90%
did they have ships?

00:18:38.612 --> 00:18:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: If they did,
I never saw them.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:84%
They came in on mass
landing craft that

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.640 align:middle line:84%
would slow down
and stop and land,

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.819 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
come out en masse.

00:18:50.819 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they had like
cargo ships or something?

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They had
cargo transport ships,

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:90%
but not like combat shuttles.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And did you know
who they were working for?

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: At that time, no.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: No.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, did not.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:10.560 align:middle line:84%
We had no intelligence on
what their ultimate goal was

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:84%
other than
destruction and death.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:84%
We had no intelligence
on where they came from

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:20.430 align:middle line:84%
or what their home planet
was like or who sent them

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:84%
or why they were picking
on this particular planet.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.742 align:middle line:84%
Again, that was
information that I

00:19:25.742 --> 00:19:30.025 align:middle line:84%
had pieced together later, which
is part of this false flag.

00:19:30.025 --> 00:19:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Were you beginning
to get the drift, though?

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I had started getting
the picture on this planet--

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:84%
that was when my good
friend Johan had informed me

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:84%
about the history of the Mars
Germans and the Cabal on Earth.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So that
happened on Callidus 3.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Callidus 3, yup.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That's where
you met Johan.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I knew him from the
original training at the Fi.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:01.290 align:middle line:84%
But that was where he had told
me about the true history.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the massive
download happened

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:90%
at this time of your second 20?

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, that
was when I found out

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:84%
the history of the Mars Germans
and the breakaway civilization

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and the nuclear
demonstration strike

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:84%
on the lone US Navy heavy
cruiser in the Pacific

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and the theft of the
mind-wipe technology

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and the destruction of the
Challenger and Chernobyl.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was when
I found out a lot

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:84%
of some of the history of
Earth that was not told to us.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you fought
for almost six years

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
on this planet against
these invading creatures.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And you nearly lost.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Oh, yes, several times.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Several times.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But the antimatter weapons
eventually were what saved you?

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Once they gave
us the green light

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:84%
on being able to use those,
we started incorporating them

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:84%
into smaller and
smaller packages

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.780 align:middle line:84%
so that we weren't interested
in taking our own lives.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:84%
We were trying to protect
ourselves and the civilians

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.920 align:middle line:90%
that we were in charge of.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to get it down
to a grenade-sized device,

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and we were able to use it in a
launcher, specialized launcher,

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.800 align:middle line:90%
so that we could then--

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, we didn't have to
be up close and personal.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But aside from the small unit
employment of antimatter,

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.850 align:middle line:84%
we were also using
it on a larger scale

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:84%
to try and take out
the enemy bases.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And it came to a point
where at the end of the war,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.430 align:middle line:84%
there was a time where we had
to use larger size antimatter.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being in a
bunker and watching this go off,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.384 align:middle line:84%
and there were people
in that room that

00:21:52.384 --> 00:21:53.800 align:middle line:84%
didn't think it
was going to work,

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:84%
that were convinced that
we were going to lose,

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and that every person in
that room was going to die

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and that we were not going to
be able to save this planet--

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle line:90%
or that planet, at the time.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So the employment and the
use of those large antimatter

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.922 align:middle line:90%
was the turning point for us.

00:22:14.922 --> 00:22:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you destroyed the
bases of these creatures.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We destroyed their
bases on a large scale.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did a lot of
the indigenous people

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.055 align:middle line:90%
die in this war?

00:22:26.055 --> 00:22:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were 4 billion
people on the planet when

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:84%
we arrived, and there
was about a third

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:84%
of them left by
the end of the war.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Again, the same thing?

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Devastated place?

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Devastation
from one side

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.730 align:middle line:90%
of the planet to the other.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some of
the areas that we'd

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:48.270 align:middle line:84%
used the antimatter explosives
on had been abandoned.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Clearly they weren't going
to be used anytime soon.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.400 align:middle line:84%
We went through the process
of rebuilding the planet

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and getting them
back to a state where

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:84%
they were able to have
a civilization that they

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:90%
were able to continue on.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So did you
guys have friends

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.705 align:middle line:90%
among the indigenous population?

00:23:06.705 --> 00:23:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, yes.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.340 align:middle line:84%
We ended up getting really close
with a lot of the indigenous

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:84%
populations because we
were fighting beside them.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not like, hey,
we're going to be here fighting

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll see you later.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we lost,
we were all dead.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that tends to bond
people together on a very strong

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.080 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.988 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and they
were such nice people.

00:23:32.988 --> 00:23:37.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, unfortunately
we came along.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.060 align:middle line:84%
But they had a
great civilization.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was
based on bartering.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:84%
They had their own rich
culture, religious beliefs,

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:90%
spiritual beliefs.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have much in
the way of wars or fighting.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:84%
They had established
a long-standing peace.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And so how can you
not like people

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:02.430 align:middle line:84%
that are open and
genuinely caring

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.100 align:middle line:84%
about their neighbor
or the person

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:90%
they're two streets over?

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Any of you
have any love affairs

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.530 align:middle line:90%
with any of the indigenous?

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Let me just say that
the commanders' policy was

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:84%
that any of the
relationships that we

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:84%
had with the
indigenous populations,

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.020 align:middle line:84%
they encouraged us
to embed ourselves

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:84%
into it because they
felt that we would

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:90%
be able to gain more from that.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
But the policies
were that we were not

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.730 align:middle line:84%
allowed to have that affect
our command decisions.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:43.590 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there were people that
had relationships with some

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.690 align:middle line:90%
of the indigenous populations.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Did it cause or
pose any problems?

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, keep in mind
that every person

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that was from Earth that
was there was enhanced.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And so as an enhancement,
and as an intuitive empath,

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
the people that you're
most connected to

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.650 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
are in your unit.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And so establishing a
romantic relationship

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:16.370 align:middle line:84%
with some of the indigenous
populations-- did it happen?

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it did.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Were they long lasting
or long standing?

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.810 align:middle line:90%
No, they weren't.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So the MO was clear.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:29.420 align:middle line:84%
They're modernizing, unquote,
these planets and then bringing

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:84%
them into the Cabal system and
creating a kind of an empire?

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Establishing
a local Cabal,

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and those elites that
are going to be in charge

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:45.860 align:middle line:84%
of that particular system,
probably establishing advanced

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:84%
technology research and
development that separates

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the two classes of
people from the elites

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:90%
to the common people.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Sound familiar?

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yep.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Part of our
job was co-opting

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:84%
some of the local leaders
and getting them involved

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and getting them to agree to
the requirements of our help.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.209 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And I would say that
the people doing this probably

00:26:11.209 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:90%
thought that they were helping.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were convinced
that they were helping.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.190 align:middle line:90%
They had no idea.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, in all
honesty, neither did we.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.310 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea about
the long-term goals

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:84%
of what was planned
and that they

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:84%
were going to be turning
these planetary environments

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:35.360 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations into proxies,
into controlled systems.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.170 align:middle line:90%
We had no idea about that.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So had these peaceful
people on this Planet Two,

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:84%
had they been involved
in war before?

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:49.520 align:middle line:84%
When the Mars Germans came
along and made this proposition

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.750 align:middle line:84%
to them, they
certainly showed them

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:84%
what information
they wanted them

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:84%
to see as far as the progression
of these alien invasion

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:84%
attacks, in order to further
their false flag narrative.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And they would have
shown them, OK, look,

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:84%
this is the system that's
neighboring that was attacked,

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and you have X number of months
before you're next on the list.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, you
have a choice to make.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:84%
We can help you, or you can
suffer the consequences.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the humanoids
on Planet number Two,

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:27.890 align:middle line:90%
you've described them.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Do they have the same facial
characteristics and things

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.060 align:middle line:90%
that other humanoids have?

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, it'd be the same.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you know, we had
talked before about why

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:84%
we think that there is so much
widespread human-looking beings

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:52.090 align:middle line:84%
throughout our
particular galaxy.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to
believe that, you know,

00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:01.820 align:middle line:84%
each of the planetary bodies
are conscious on some level.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the blueprint
of the human shape,

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:84%
with the star pattern, two
arms, two legs, a head,

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and asymmetric along
the center line,

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:18.500 align:middle line:84%
that's something that is
a blueprint for our logos.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, are there other
areas of creation

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:27.400 align:middle line:84%
that have something else
that's going to be more common?

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:84%
You can count on that being
the case because, you know,

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.740 align:middle line:84%
there is life far beyond
the extensive anything

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.620 align:middle line:90%
that we could ever even imagine.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
seeing humanity

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:44.950 align:middle line:84%
on another planet within
an area that we can get to,

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:48.040 align:middle line:84%
or something that
resembles humanity,

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.585 align:middle line:84%
is something that we could
expect, at least in our logos.

00:28:52.585 --> 00:28:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I want to
thank you, Jason,

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.522 align:middle line:84%
for being brave enough
to come on our show.

00:28:56.522 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Well, thank you, Jay.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
you having me here.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know, again, this
is all about disclosure.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: It is.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm Jay Weidner,
and thanks for watching.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure," where

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.680 align:middle line:10%
people share their clandestine
involvement with government

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:10%
agencies, the military,
and secret space programs.

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So it's made up of
many different types of races

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and ambassadors
representing star systems.

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Part of the
training regimen

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that we went through
before planet fall included

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous amount of time
in neural education chairs.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.986 align:middle line:84%
>>GOODE: They're coming
here for our technology.

00:29:33.986 --> 00:29:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Humans are making
technology that we're

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.930 align:middle line:90%
selling to non-terrestrials.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:48.310 align:middle line:90%
