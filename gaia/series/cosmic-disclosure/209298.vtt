00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.090 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.570 align:middle line:10%
we are with Ricardo Gonzalez,
author and researcher for Peru

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:10%
who has experienced
multiple direct contacts

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.000 align:middle line:10%
with an extraterrestrial
species called the Apunians.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking about
your own personal contact

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.380 align:middle line:90%
story, Ricardo.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.048 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RICARDO GONZALEZ:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.548 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Ricardo, what
personal story would you

00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:42.358 align:middle line:90%
like to share with us today?

00:00:42.358 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: On other
occasions, we've

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
discussed my experiences with
extraterrestrial contact that

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:84%
has developed
especially with a group

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.330 align:middle line:84%
of human-looking entities, who
claim to come from the Alpha

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Centauri system.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And as we've discussed
in other interviews

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:84%
here with you,
Emery, these beings

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:84%
were already known to
my ancestors in Peru

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:84%
by the people of the mountains
who were shepherds, farmers.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Who, when they saw these
tall, human-looking

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
beings emerged
from the mountains,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:84%
they called them Apunians
because the Indigenous

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.800 align:middle line:84%
name for Mountain
in Peru is apu,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:84%
which means protector or lord
in quechua, an ancient language.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:10%
But this time, I would like to
share something more than that.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Very personal experiences
related to this contact story

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:84%
that has happened to me because
this started a long time ago

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And maybe my testimony
can be of use

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
to those who have followed
my work, who right now are

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:90%
watching us on Gaia.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I am convinced that those
who assert that we maintain

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:84%
this contact with
these beings, we

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
have lived wonderful as well
as inexplicable experiences

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:90%
since we were children.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I remember when
I was very young,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I dreamed that I walked
out of my bedroom

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and walked through the
living room of the house,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:84%
in the front room,
amongst the furniture.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:10%
I would sit on the couch,
stand up again, walk,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:10%
and wander around the house.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.660 align:middle line:90%
And I said to myself, gee.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:90%
I must be sleepwalking.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.470 align:middle line:10%
I woke up walking.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to
go back to my room

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and lay down and
go back to sleep.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:90%
I was a young boy.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So I got scared when on
my way back to my bedroom,

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I saw myself there
still sleeping.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.720 align:middle line:84%
After a moment, I woke
up in my body in bed.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Very distressed, worried by
this nightmare I had had.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Then this phenomena
occurred again.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And I awoke in my pajamas in
the garden outside the house.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But all the doors that exited
the house going outside

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:90%
were closed.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered, how
did I get outside then?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Then I saw a small object,
like a kind of metal egg

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:90%
in the garden.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It had a luminous opening,
as if a door had been opened.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:90%
So I walked over to that door.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:90%
And out of it came a child.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:84%
A child like me, but
dressed strangely.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:84%
He appeared to be dressed
in some kind of overalls

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.240 align:middle line:84%
or loose foil,
like aluminum foil.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:84%
He had light colored
eyes, and he was bald.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered if he
was sick because for me,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
as a child back then, seeing
a bald child was synonymous

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
with him going
through some illness.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It was an idea of mine,
a child's foolishness

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:90%
in this so-called dream.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And this child with big
eyes and a very tender

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
gaze told me that he
had come from the stars

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and that he wanted
to be my friend.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And he would ask me questions
and talk to me in Spanish

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and in very simple terms, like
the ones I used as a child.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:90%
This happened several times.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was just
a dream until something

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:90%
very curious happened.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Days later, I awoke
sleepwalking again,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe, in the
living room of my house.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself,
this situation again?

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm dreaming again?

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Then through the picture
window of the living room that

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.910 align:middle line:84%
overlooked the garden, I was
able to make out a person who

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:90%
was entering my house.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:90%
And I was afraid.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
I had the feeling that it was
a person coming into the house

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:90%
to steal.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:10%
The impression was so
great that again, I

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.390 align:middle line:10%
woke up agitated in my bedroom.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I became aware of my
body, I knocked on the door

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:90%
to my parents' room.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
They were sleeping
in their bedroom.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And I told them what I had
seen, what had happened.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And then my parents said,
it was a nightmare, son.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
But I insisted so much
then I asked my father

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that there was
no one outside the house.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle line:84%
My father went outside the
house, and no one was there.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But he noticed that
he had forgotten

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:90%
to lock one of the doors.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So he took the time to
make sure everything

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle line:90%
was locked correctly.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.390 align:middle line:84%
It was a nightmare, son,
don't worry, he told me.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The next day at breakfast, both
my parents had poker faces.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And they said, someone tried
to break into the house.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.970 align:middle line:84%
We found the marks, the
footprints of someone

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:90%
who came through the garden.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, the
things they stole

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:84%
were things that were
outside the house.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:90%
In the yard outside the house.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And since my father made sure
that everything was locked,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.720 align:middle line:84%
they could not get
into the house.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.460 align:middle line:84%
You may wonder what
this experience

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.310 align:middle line:84%
has to do with my
extraterrestrial contact.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:84%
If this wasn't a dream,
and it actually happened,

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and I was out of my
body watching something

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that was going to
happen later, that

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.930 align:middle line:84%
was going to be stolen from
us, what about the dream

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I had of that
extraterrestrial child?

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Was it also real?

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I never knew who it was nor
where exactly he came from,

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.650 align:middle line:84%
but it's one of the
experiences that I

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.720 align:middle line:90%
treasure from my childhood.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Around that same time,
in the late 1970s

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:84%
is when I experienced
my first UFO sightings.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't happen
right around my house,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.850 align:middle line:84%
but on the outskirts of the
city of Lima where we lived.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Lima usually, Emery, has
cloudy skies, very overcast.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:90%
I think you were in Lima.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:84%
You remember that the sky is
always very cloudy, right?

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:84%
This is due to the
Humboldt current that

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.300 align:middle line:84%
passes through the Pacific
Ocean and generates

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:90%
that particular weather pattern.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It is a weather pattern
in the capital of Peru.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So in order for
the people of Lima

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:84%
to see clear,
unobstructed blue skies,

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
we have to travel
outside the capital.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:84%
We traveled an hour or two to
the region of the mountains.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And that region is where I had
the first sightings as a child.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I would walk through
the foothills

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.160 align:middle line:90%
of a town called Chosica.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And some lights appeared that
seemed like they were moving.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Lights appeared to be
traveling through the skies

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:84%
as if they were satellites,
but they were in formation.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, they would stop.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And some would zip off,
zigzagging, moving erratically.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
For me, as a child running
through the gardens and hills

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and since this happened at
night, with all my innocence,

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:90%
I called them walking stars.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:84%
But as the contact advanced,
already in my adolescence,

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I knew how to distinguish
what a satellite was

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
or what could be
a shooting star.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was obviously not what
I saw when I was very young.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:84%
This is how my
contact experience

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
began with the child's
innocent dreams,

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:84%
with strange lights in
the sky, without imagining

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:84%
what was going to
happen to me much later.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to tell you
the story because I

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
think contact with these beings
really starts in childhood.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:90%
They track us.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:84%
They observe us
from an early age.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:90%
And my case is one of many.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Ricardo, what other
contact experiences have

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.370 align:middle line:90%
you had when you were young?

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Going
back to the year 1988.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was a boy
between 13 and 14 years old.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:84%
On school days in Lima,
I was, at that time,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
playing in the yard
outside my house.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
A courtyard that had a
garden that curiously enough

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.330 align:middle line:84%
had been the scene
of my dream with

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:90%
that extraterrestrial child.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.990 align:middle line:90%
I remember it was summer.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:90%
It was very hot.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the summer is
when the people of Lima

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
can see the most
cloud-free, clear skies.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was playing
with a soccer ball in the yard.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
When out of the corner of my
eye, I glimpse to one side,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I see peripherally
a strong light

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:90%
in the sky that is moving.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:90%
It was as bright as the sun.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:84%
It did not make
any kind of noise.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I lived near the Lima
International Airport.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So I was used to distinguishing
between planes, helicopters, et

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.010 align:middle line:90%
But this was different.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Very different.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And the puzzling thing is that
I had a very special feeling

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:90%
in my chest.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I haven't talked
about this much,

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:84%
but this energy in my
chest was so strong

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that it made me feel something
special, beautiful, like joy.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.720 align:middle line:84%
As if it were a wonderful
re-encounter with something

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:90%
I could not rationally explain.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.190 align:middle line:84%
It almost felt like a
euphoric joy, Emery.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
When I saw that object
moving in the sky,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:84%
it went toward the
sea, towards the ocean,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:90%
and well, it disappeared.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And in that summer
of 1988 in Peru,

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
the media reported an intense
wave of many UFO sightings.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Throughout that year,
different news outlets

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.570 align:middle line:84%
reported the appearance
of the flying disks

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:90%
as the press called them.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Then I knew I wasn't the only
witness to this phenomenon.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
a particular stage

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.120 align:middle line:84%
began for me, in
which I tried to find

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:90%
answers for what I had seen.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.960 align:middle line:84%
In a very spontaneous,
very amateur way,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I began to investigate
the subject.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember collecting UFO
news from the newspapers,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and cutting them out, and
putting together folders.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to follow the
phenomenon, to understand it.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:84%
At this time, I began
to have the same dreams

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.180 align:middle line:90%
that I had had as a child.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I wondered if because
of this sighting,

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the power of suggestion
prompted these UFO dreams again.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.415 align:middle line:84%
But I must confess
something to you.

00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:26.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't very disciplined in
that research, in that search.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:90%
I was a teenager.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, at that time, I
was thinking about what field

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I was going to study when I
finished school, hanging out

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:84%
with my friends
because when I talk

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.390 align:middle line:84%
to them about these
things, I was the weirdo.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that at
times, my friends no longer

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:84%
wanted to invite
me to play baseball

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.510 align:middle line:84%
or to hang out at their
houses because they thought,

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.400 align:middle line:90%
no, Ricardo is strange.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:84%
He's interested
in other subjects.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to want to come
to the soccer game or play

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:90%
baseball.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to fit in
and be a normal kid.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Not talking about my dreams,
my feelings, or the lights

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.670 align:middle line:90%
I had seen.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I was very attracted
to art culture.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And my dream was to be a
painter or musician when

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:90%
I finished high school.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.610 align:middle line:90%
So I forgot about UFOs.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, my
father gave me some advice.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.680 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
become an artist,

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:90%
you're going to starve to death.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:84%
The ideas back then,
of those times, right?

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And he suggested that I study a
complimentary double major that

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.520 align:middle line:90%
could help me.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So I started studying marketing
and business administration.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.550 align:middle line:10%
And I started to
live a normal life,

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:10%
if you could call it that.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But they, these beings
came back when I was

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.030 align:middle line:90%
between 18 and 19 years old.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:84%
We have discussed this
experience before here

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:90%
on this program.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Only now, I'll
explain how I arrived

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
at that experience with much
more personal and emotional

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.300 align:middle line:90%
details I would say.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.160 align:middle line:84%
It was in 1993, when I was
studying this field that I just

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
described, when the first
clear telepathic message

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:90%
from these beings arrived.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I had taken a break
from my studies.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I had closed my book
and my notebooks.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
of that break, I

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:84%
heard a voice in perfect
Spanish with a neutral accent

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and with a certain metallic
tone you could call it.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And it tells me,
don't stop looking.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Beautiful

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I don't know if
it was a kind of reprimand

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
because I had stopped and was
focusing on something else.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Don't stop searching, this
male voice clearly told me.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And he added, we are
extraterrestrial beings,

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.280 align:middle line:84%
and we are entering into
communication with you.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And you will go through
preparation in order

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:90%
to meet us at another time.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
As I've told you on another
occasion, Emery, I said enough.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I need a confirmation.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Then this voice invited me to
go up to the house's rooftop

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:90%
terrace to obtain evidence.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I went up accompanied
by my family.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, a bright
red light appeared on the house.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about
this on another occasion.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:84%
It was a very important
confirmation for me.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So from 1993 until now,
here, talking to you,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I haven't set
aside this subject.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Researching it, experiencing
it has cost me a lot.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:84%
There were great
sacrifices because I

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
decided to delve
into this subject

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:84%
despite everyone's
disapproval and denial.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.440 align:middle line:84%
When I appeared on
Peruvian television

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.320 align:middle line:84%
talking about all
this, I upset my bosses

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:90%
at the company I worked for.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And the international company
I worked for fired me.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to dedicate
myself full time

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:90%
to this wonderful adventure.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:10%
Not to convince people
of what happened to me,

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.630 align:middle line:10%
but only to invite them to
think about this possibility.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:90%
And here I am.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The contact
experiences you share today

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
with us are very
different from each other.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Now how does that correlate
with the future experiences

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:90%
you had with the Apunians?

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Certainly,
what I'm discussing

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:84%
complements everything we have
talked about before, Emery.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:84%
I've referred to
these experiences

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.510 align:middle line:90%
in some of my books.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a very
important story in order

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to understand how I later
had the other contacts.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, I
always wondered about

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrial child
dressed in aluminum who

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:90%
appeared to me in the garden.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Does he really exist?

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Or was it a hologram,
a projection

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
that these beings created to
establish friendly contact

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:90%
with me?

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Because in fact, if
they did it that way,

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:84%
they created another child
like me, but extraterrestrial.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the
experiences weren't much

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:84%
different than my
recent experiences.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.760 align:middle line:84%
But those experiences
were adapted

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.820 align:middle line:90%
to my age and my consciousness.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps when I was most
ready to meet these beings,

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:84%
they presented themselves
as they really are.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:10%
Remember the message I
received while studying

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:40.110 align:middle line:10%
in my bedroom, when
they told me you

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.560 align:middle line:10%
will go through preparation
in order to meet us?

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's happened.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:84%
From 1993 to 1997, I went
through a very intense

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
preparation suggested
by these beings

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to
meet them physically.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Back then, just
imagine, I was so young.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I joined extraterrestrial
contact groups, ufology groups,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.800 align:middle line:90%
whatever I could think of.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Trying to live and study
this phenomenon from within.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was there that I learned
about the contact protocols

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about
in another episode.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.990 align:middle line:84%
That was the suggestion
of these beings

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:84%
in order to establish
better communication.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:10%
There, I also discovered
that the beings who

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:10%
were contacting me had already
contacted other people in Peru

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:10%
decades ago.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I was just one of many witnesses
in a long chain of contactees.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Then I said to myself, why me?

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Why is this happening to me
if other people in the world

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
have already had
these experiences.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I was told that a few people
cannot do all the work.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.700 align:middle line:84%
That it is necessary to create
a movement of contact witnesses,

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.420 align:middle line:84%
whose experiences and
information can complement

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.870 align:middle line:90%
each other.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:84%
To give greater
strength to the message

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't manifest
themselves right now publicly

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:90%
to all humanity.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So the work of extraterrestrial
contact witnesses

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:84%
would be part of preparing
the way for that.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think that these
experiences with the Apunians

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.620 align:middle line:84%
have not been very
different from what

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.800 align:middle line:90%
I experienced in my childhood.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.815 align:middle line:90%
They were simply adapting.

00:18:20.815 --> 00:18:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What can
you say to the people

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:84%
out there that will give
them a sense of certainty

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.790 align:middle line:90%
about the experience they had?

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Many people
have lived experiences,

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:90%
like the one I had, of course.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they labeled those
experiences as a child's

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.450 align:middle line:90%
dreams or imagination.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Could it happen?

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
The imagination is very
powerful and even more

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
so in the fertile mind
like that of a child.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But my advice for those
people who have lived

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:84%
or who are living these
experiences, regardless

00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:84%
of your age, is to have
elements of confirmation.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
For example, I took
into consideration

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.080 align:middle line:84%
the garden experience
with the presumed

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial child.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Then in other similar dreams,
if I can call them dreams,

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I saw things that were
later fulfilled impactfully.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.530 align:middle line:84%
If I took into
consideration the message

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I received, the first
message at age 18,

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.870 align:middle line:84%
it is because these
beings announced to me

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.090 align:middle line:84%
an event on the
rooftop of the house,

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.280 align:middle line:84%
on the terrace of the
house, and the sighting

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle line:84%
happened with my
family as witnesses.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And all my life,
it's been like that.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Offering confirmations.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I was very visible on
television from a young age.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.610 align:middle line:84%
In conferences, interviews,
anything you can think of.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:84%
In interviews with
psychologists,

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:84%
psychiatrists,
skeptical journalists,

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:90%
to see if I was lying or not.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me the
classic questions.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.730 align:middle line:90%
If I had witnesses?

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:01.640 align:middle line:84%
If I had information that
had been fulfilled over time?

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:90%
If I had any kind of evidence?

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
They did personality
testing on me

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:84%
to see if I was a sensible
person, or a fraud,

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.140 align:middle line:90%
or a fanatic.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And I faced all that.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And I always came
out on top because I

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:84%
was sure of what I had
lived since childhood

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and the elements of confirmation
that I'd been able to obtain.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, that doesn't
happen much anymore.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Contact witnesses are no
longer required to do so much.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:84%
They are no longer asked for
more evidence or greater proof

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:90%
of what they are experiencing.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:84%
It is becoming a
matter of belief.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
In which anyone comes out and
says, this happened to me.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:90%
I remember.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I had a dream.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And you believe them because
it resonates in your heart,

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
or because you empathize, or
because you like that person.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that on
these issues that

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:84%
are so serious, for
your own mental health,

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle line:84%
you have to get confirmations
of what you are experiencing

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and also out of
responsibility for what you're

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.040 align:middle line:90%
sharing with a larger audience.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:84%
In my contact experience, and
I'm talking to you as a friend

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:84%
personally, all this
was not easy at first.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Contact witnesses, when
opening up publicly, as I said,

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
for a portion of those listening
to you, you're a fraud.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, for
another type of audience,

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:41.760 align:middle line:84%
you're almost an ambassador
of extraterrestrials.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.380 align:middle line:90%
A special person.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
If Ricardo remembers
extraordinary things, if he

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
saw these objects and these
beings, writes about it,

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:84%
speaks about it
at conferences, he

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:84%
is a very special person
with a great mission.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:90%
And they follow you blindly.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:84%
They passionately accept any
information that you share.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:84%
The worst thing that can
happen to you in these cases

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:84%
is that you start to
think a lot of yourself

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:84%
because people are
beginning to transform you

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.680 align:middle line:90%
into a kind of cosmic guru.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:90%
And that, Emery, terrified me.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:90%
I learned.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And I try to speak as coherently
as possible about my contact

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.650 align:middle line:84%
experiences, as well as
about all the contact

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.340 align:middle line:90%
information that comes to me.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:90%
It's part of my life story.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But the most important thing is
the message, the information.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.017 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're sharing now.

00:22:38.017 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's always a pleasure.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Thank
you, my friend.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on Cosmic Disclosure.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> He just came
right out and said,

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:90%
what do you think about aliens?

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, would
you like to meet some?

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
either these people

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.420 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely
insane, or this is

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.970 align:middle line:84%
going to be the
greatest day of my life.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:13.270 align:middle line:84%
We turned the corner,
and there they were.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:90%
