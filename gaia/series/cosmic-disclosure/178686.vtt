>> DAVID WILCOCK: Welcome
back to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.074 align:middle line:84%
I'm here with our special
guest, Emery Smith.

00:00:26.074 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode,
we're going to walk

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:84%
through what happened after
he left the underground base.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.588 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY SMITH: Thanks, Dave.

00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Let's now talk through
how your assignment with these

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.870 align:middle line:90%
autopsies ended.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you
had mentioned before

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:84%
that about every four months you
got another security clearance.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And I believe you said that
you had stopped at A22.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.319 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: That's correct.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: OK, how many cycles
of this autopsy tour of duty,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:90%
if you will, did you do?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.766 align:middle line:90%
How long were you actually--

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: About 22-- about
22 quarterly advancements.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I never failed to get an
advancement every quarter.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So it took about on average
of 4 and 1/2, 5 years.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I finished my active
duty in 5.5 years.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Now, did you continue
to do your cover job the whole

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:90%
time you worked down there?

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, I stayed an
additional two quarters,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.360 align:middle line:84%
actually, after I got
out of the military.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And then things started getting
a little different down there

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I think I told you
this once before--

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.830 align:middle line:84%
I started getting bodies
that were pretty warm.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell that they're
very recent by the rigor

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:90%
mortis that barely set in.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:84%
But after I finished my work
with the United States Air

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Force, I decided to stay
working in the underground labs

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.615 align:middle line:90%
of Sandia and Los Alamos.

00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Did that allow you
to have more hours since you

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.680 align:middle line:90%
didn't have coverage--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Absolutely,
it sure did.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So tell me the
difference between a shift that

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:90%
you would have had.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Like, walk us through
your typical day

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
before you left the Air Force
to after you left the Air Force.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Like, how many
hours did you work?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go?

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.143 align:middle line:90%
Just so we have a sense of that.

00:02:19.143 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, my work started
at 5:30 AM at Kirtland Air

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Force Base hospital.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
We worked till about
2:30 to 3:30 PM,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and then I went
into work at 7:00 PM

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:90%
at the underground location.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would stay there,
usually, anywhere

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:90%
from four to eight hours.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And then just go home
and repeat that anywhere

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:90%
from five to seven days a week.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:84%
The active duty job at
Kirtland Air Force Base,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I only worked Monday
through Friday

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
pulling emergency trauma call
usually one weekend a month.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And during these
times, by pulling call,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I was not allowed to work
in the underground bases

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
because I was not
allowed to have a beeper

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.312 align:middle line:84%
and beepers don't
work down there.

00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So once you
left the Air Force,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.512 align:middle line:84%
what was your schedule like
in the underground base?

00:03:06.512 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It was great.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I kept the same hours because
I liked working evenings.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm a night person, and I'm
very productive at night.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'd go in around 5:00 PM and
be out of there by 1:00 or 2:00

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.315 align:middle line:90%
AM.

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I would
have to stay longer.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I had to
spend the night there.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And I started transitioning
over from doing

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:84%
the harvesting and autopsy
work and moving more

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of
biologics and was

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:84%
part of their biological
warfare division

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:84%
where they were
making all sorts of--

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
types of things, to control
viruses and to also deploy

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:90%
viruses around the world.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, certainly in
terms of known international

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
agreements like the
Geneva Convention,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
we're not supposed to be using
conventional chemical weapons

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:90%
or biological weapons.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Correct.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: But this clearly
sounds like they didn't care

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah-- no, it was a
total disregard for humanity,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying to figure
out how to make a virus that

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.250 align:middle line:84%
was very specific
to your lineage.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And they would deploy these via
using contrails with the jets.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.519 align:middle line:84%
You heard about these
conspiracy theories.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's one way they would
do it, was just to spray a city.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And let's say they could
get the lineage DNA

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
from a specific
ethnic race maybe,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and if you had that
genetic code in you,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
it would wipe out all
that race, all that part

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:90%
of the human race.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.053 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, clearly nothing
like that's actually been done

00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:42.340 align:middle line:90%
because we're all still here.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Correct.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: But they were trying
to find things like this?

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, and they
took extraterrestrial DNA--

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.530 align:middle line:84%
some extraterrestrials a
long time ago could program

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:84%
their leukocytes and monocytes
to combat certain genetic

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:90%
races.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you programmed your
leukocytes and white blood

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
cells, neutrophils, and whatnot
to attack someone like me,

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and I was a different
race, you would just

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:84%
have to come up to me
and your body already

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
has a virus in it which your
white blood cells are OK with.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And by touching me
or sneezing on me

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:84%
or communicating with me somehow
physically or airborne-wise,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.850 align:middle line:84%
you could give me this
virus, and it would kill me.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, I could see
skeptics attacking you on this

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:84%
point because leukocytes
would involve--

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:84%
they would need to involve
blood to blood contact

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:90%
I would assume.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The leukocytes are
protecting them from my virus.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So if I have a virus and
you know you have a virus,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:84%
we can't really fight
each other or touch

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:90%
each other cause we'll die.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So those leukocytes
were ramped up

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:84%
to fight this specific virus
that I'm going to give you.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So once it was airborne or
transmitted through any blood

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:84%
pathogen wise or whatnot, it
would get into your system.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I still don't really
think I've heard you say why

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:90%
they would--

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
how would they justify designing
an ethno-specific virus.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:90%
What was the angle--

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.670 align:middle line:84%
what would they tell you
about why this was necessary?

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.044 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I was told there's
some religious organizations

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and factions out there that
are actually trying to do this.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And just in case
one day, there is

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
some sort of mass
extinction, barely

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
killing almost more than
half of the population,

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to
get control over it.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And if they had some
sort of gender, race beef

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:84%
with somebody, and
they wanted to get rid

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:84%
of a certain type
of race, that's

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.160 align:middle line:90%
how they would release this.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.769 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Were they trying
to develop it for every type

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.865 align:middle line:90%
of person on Earth?

00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I
don't know that.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I know this because I heard
scientists talking about it.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't in a
briefing that I read,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I've actually heard
the scientists talking

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.560 align:middle line:90%
about this type of technology.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a lower
echelon part of the base

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
once I got out of my active
duty service from the military

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and was working on growing
proteins and things.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, this is
very disturbing stuff

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm curious as to what
stories do they tell people who

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.000 align:middle line:84%
are working on this to make them
feel like they're doing a good

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:84%
job, or they're
serving their country.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:90%
What was the angle?

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The angle for
that is most of them do know

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:90%
they're doing this.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And I know some
scientists that have

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:84%
been in these projects that
had a change of heart halfway

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And these scientists, sometimes,
if they try to get out

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and they're that deep
in, they will make sure

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.364 align:middle line:90%
that you can't get out.

00:07:47.364 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And they will inoculate
you with things,

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
so if you did return
to the surface

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
without getting the antidote,
you would die from sunlight.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, and this
is how they keep control

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.580 align:middle line:90%
of the scientist.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.349 align:middle line:84%
Many of them have
families on the outside,

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and they get fed up with some
of the things that are going on

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:84%
because they're afraid that
if something did happen,

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.150 align:middle line:84%
it would maybe affect
their grandchildren

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:90%
or their daughters and sons.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So they are starting to stand
up now, the scientists in here.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting
to fight back.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And the white hats
out there, the Cabal

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:84%
are also getting
a little bit upset

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:84%
about the small
percentage of the Cabal

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
that is kind of death
and destruction.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: OK, so let's now go
through how your time working

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:90%
in the underground base ended.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.610 align:middle line:84%
You had mentioned something
about that warm specimens came

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.537 align:middle line:84%
Did you decide that you wanted
to quit and submit resignation?

00:08:43.537 --> 00:08:44.370 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, that's
exactly what I did.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Just like you would
with a normal job,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.050 align:middle line:84%
you have to fill out
a lot of paperwork,

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and you have to be tracked
for x amount of time.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Mine was 20 years
after I got out

00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
that I had to be willing to come
in for questioning if needed.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Or if I had surgeries, I
would have to notify them.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:84%
If I was traveling to
hazardous locations,

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I would have to notify them.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:84%
There was different
types of lists of things

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.200 align:middle line:84%
that you had to follow
in order for you

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:84%
to have a nice discharge from
the underground civilian lab.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: When Pete
Peterson's wife died,

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%
the people he'd been working for
brought him in for an extended

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:84%
two months debriefing because
they were very worried that

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
the emotional trauma of losing
this woman he was very attached

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.200 align:middle line:84%
to might cause him
to start talking.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So did they monitor your life
for these types of crises

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and could you end up
getting brought back

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:90%
in if something happened?

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes,
absolutely, they did.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's happened even
after my 20 years.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I was approached even recently
after my mother passed away

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.380 align:middle line:90%
last year.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So yes, they do keep tabs, and
it doesn't bother me at all.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know they're
always looking anyway.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:84%
There's no sacred
secret conversation

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:90%
on this planet, that's for sure.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Because everything is
recorded everywhere,

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and they've had that
technology when I was there.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So that was 20 years ago
that they had the technology

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.322 align:middle line:84%
to record all the vibrations
on the planet and every voice.

00:10:24.322 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: You've probably heard
about these satellites from

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:84%
the National Reconnaissance
Office that are constantly

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:84%
recording the surface of
the Earth where everybody is

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.277 align:middle line:84%
and have enough resolution
that they could actually read

00:10:35.277 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
the fine print on your driver's
license if you were just

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:90%
holding it in your hand.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Good grief that
was in the 1960s, sir.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.780 align:middle line:90%
You know what we can do now?

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.660 align:middle line:84%
We can see what's
inside the walls.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.550 align:middle line:84%
We can see what kind of termite
is eating inside your wall.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's public
information now

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing
in South America.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Big corporation usually
using that something,

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.827 align:middle line:84%
using that technology
for spying.

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But now they're using
it to make money

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:90%
to support their other agendas.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, these things have
been around for a while.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can go
pretty much anywhere

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.790 align:middle line:84%
on the planet in 40 minutes
with these satellites

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and get HD 4K
pictures of anyone,

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
regardless if there's
cloud coverage,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and also get a wave form
back of exactly what it is.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So let's go to the
point now were you filed all

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.830 align:middle line:84%
this paperwork and
you get discharged.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.130 align:middle line:84%
What is your life
like immediately

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.240 align:middle line:90%
after you left this job?

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.698 align:middle line:84%
You're not in the
military anymore,

00:11:42.698 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
you're not working
underground anymore.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.967 align:middle line:84%
And when was your next contact
with the classified world?

00:11:48.967 --> 00:11:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, actually,
I stayed in contact with

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
the classified world
in a medium state,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:84%
which means if there is a
project coming or people are

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:84%
coming that you're needed
because of a very specific

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:84%
special thing, then I can go
back and do a couple weeks

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:90%
or a week work with them.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.200 align:middle line:90%
So I actually kept my clearance.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And that you have
to do twice a year.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:84%
You have to check in and re-get
your clearance and whatnot.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:84%
But from that point I
stayed in New Mexico

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.070 align:middle line:84%
another couple of years, and
then I went back to my hometown

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
in Fort Myers, Florida to
take care of my family.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.907 align:middle line:84%
And my mom and dad
were not doing so well.

00:12:27.907 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, but what
did you do in New Mexico?

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Were you employed
do you have a job?

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Absolutely, I'm sorry.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So after I got out of
the underground projects,

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I stayed in New Mexico for
an additional couple of years

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and was working at the
University of New Mexico

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.380 align:middle line:84%
hospital as a
surgical first assist.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: During those couple of
years you said they would call

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:84%
you in at least twice a
year for these checkups.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The twice a year is
like keeping your clearance

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:84%
verification updated, because I
would take at least maybe four

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.210 align:middle line:84%
days a month every now and
then work in the project still.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.760 align:middle line:84%
What types of assignments
were you doing at that time?

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Could you walk us
through one example

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:84%
of you working for four
or five days after you

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:90%
had left the base full-time?

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, at that time
I was just working with cells

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and culturing cells, not of
Earth origin cells, I'll say,

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:84%
but that were very
alive and well,

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.405 align:middle line:84%
and growing cells
in Petri dishes.

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:90%
So nothing too exciting.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I moved away from all the
autopsy stuff because I just--

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:84%
after having a couple of these
beings come that were warm

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I just had a really
different feeling.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And then after meeting beings
and seeing how beings are

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing any stories
that I was not privy to,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't feel like
it was right anymore.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:90%
You know, to be part of that.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So let's go now to
how did you get to Fort Myers,

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and did you continue to
interface with this classified

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.460 align:middle line:90%
world, and through what means.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.905 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, I did.

00:14:00.905 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I stayed in contact with them
and checked in twice a year.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And just a few times they
had some questions about some

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.774 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials that I
had worked on in the past.

00:14:12.774 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Did you have to
travel back to New Mexico?

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, yes, I did.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: And how did you that?

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I just got on a
flight and traveled back.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And the same thing,
I would stay off base and would

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.110 align:middle line:84%
come in in the
mornings, actually,

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:84%
instead of the evenings and get
my duty paperwork and show up

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
to the gate at Sandia, and then
actually go through a different

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:84%
location that goes
underground through there,

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:90%
and not the same location.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why they
changed it once I got out.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they just
changed locations

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:90%
for their own reasons.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Did this means of
entering the base have anything

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.717 align:middle line:84%
different from what you
described was before?

00:14:51.717 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Or was it just a different door?

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, it was a
little different because now

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with biologics
that are very dangerous.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And you actually have to be
monitored before you go in

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and after you go in through
these special analyzers

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.980 align:middle line:90%
that you have to walk through.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go through
this area to get cleansed.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of these things would
be called a dry plasma shower.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And the dry plasma
shower basically

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
was taking samples and
killing surface bacteria

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that was all over you, that
you just normally have.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And it also somehow
counts particles

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:84%
on your body to see if
they resonate frequencies

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:41.806 align:middle line:90%
of known bad cellular material.

00:15:41.806 --> 00:15:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Could you wear clothes
while you have the dry plasma?

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:44.535 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.470 align:middle line:90%
You can wear clothes.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:84%
On the way out,
though, you have to go

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.730 align:middle line:90%
through that with no clothes.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:84%
There's another one that
you have to go through

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.940 align:middle line:84%
that after you change in the
locker room, and it's up to you

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:84%
if you want to do it,
but it's a protocol.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like not made for you
to do, but everyone does it.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:90%
We just do it as a precaution.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a very small percentage
that you may have had

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:90%
something when you leave those.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.894 align:middle line:84%
Not to say something
is a bad something,

00:16:12.894 --> 00:16:15.310 align:middle line:84%
but something you could have
picked up from somebody else.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.619 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So I assume that your
outdoor clothes are quarantined

00:16:18.619 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
on the outside, and your
indoor clothes are quarantined

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:90%
on the inside.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.251 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Correct.

00:16:22.251 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So give me an example of a
specific extraterrestrial

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
species that you
had autopsied before

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:84%
that you were called back in
for more consultations on later.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what it looked like and
why did you get called back?

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, they
were mutating a bunch

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So part one of the
extraterrestrials

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.910 align:middle line:84%
that we were actually
working on looked

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.080 align:middle line:84%
like a smaller human
being, kind of troll-like.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.920 align:middle line:90%
But it also had plant DNA in it.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was very--

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.440 align:middle line:84%
it would probably remind you
of one of those ghillie suits

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that snipers wear full
of moss and leaves.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So think of a 24-inch to 36-inch
tall troll-like being that has,

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:12.519 align:middle line:84%
instead of hair, it has real
plant life growing on it.

00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, and it also
uses the energy from UV light

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:90%
to keep it healthy.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:84%
And it actually absorbs
moisture through its skin

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's very mossy like.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen many of these--

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a wig, like hair,
but they're so extremely mossy,

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.890 align:middle line:84%
like It on "The Addams Family,"
that you cannot see its face

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.987 align:middle line:84%
unless you actually started
pushing away the plant life

00:17:41.987 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:90%
that's growing on this creature.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Would this plant life
cause it to feel physical pain

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:90%
if it was removed?

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.026 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Or was it
more like body hair?

00:17:50.026 --> 00:17:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, it's
more like body hair.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But the closer you get
to where the stem is,

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:84%
the more nerve fibers and
neurons that are in it.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So neurologically,
the plant life

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:84%
has binded and mutated with
real cellular material.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.345 align:middle line:90%
That was a human and an ET.

00:18:09.345 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I can't read
your mind about why you say

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:90%
it's troll-like.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Was there something about
its face that was unusual?

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:90%
Could you describe exactly what?

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, I can tell
you that on the face and neck

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:84%
of these types of creatures,
it's like a bark on a pine

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.580 align:middle line:84%
tree, and it's very rough and
cracked-like, very cracked.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you could dry a gray
piece of clay in the sun,

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and you know how it just
crumbles and cracks away,

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.720 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly
what it looks like.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But they do have nose, they
have a mouth, they have ears,

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%
and they have eyes.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, a
troll, for example,

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.660 align:middle line:84%
somebody might think of a really
pronounced lower jaw with two

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:84%
teeth coming up like
this or something.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, no
canine teeth like that.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Just regular teeth.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:19:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And the insides are red
and pink, like our mouths.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And they have a tongue,
and they breathe.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just they get a lot of
their energy from their skin.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Do they have
this plant life growing off

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.520 align:middle line:90%
of their face?

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Or is the face area,
if you pull it back--

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Just the face area is,
like I said, it's this crumbly,

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
crackly, bark-like hard core,
very tough looking face,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:26.200 align:middle line:84%
very rigid, with no muscles in
the face that you could tell

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:90%
for them to smile.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Or they can open their
jaw and things like that.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But no facial features that
you could really tell because

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.260 align:middle line:90%
of the roughness of this skin.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What were the facial
proportions like compared

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.800 align:middle line:90%
to an Earth human?

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The head was
much larger than the body.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at a head
that would be maybe just a half

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
a size larger than
our normal head.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.172 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What about the
relationship of the size

00:19:50.172 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:84%
of the eyes, nose,
and mouth to the face?

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.046 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It was very compact
because you're looking

00:19:54.046 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:90%
at a 36-inch being here.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of someone
has dwarfism, for instance,

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:84%
around that size where
the legs and the bones

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:84%
are a little bit more
compact, if not long and lean

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:90%
like ours are.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And they may have this moss
growing all over their body.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And you might even have
leaves and vines coming out

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.190 align:middle line:84%
of the bodies,
especially on the back.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:84%
The most pronounced is on the
back where you have these vines

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and you have this
moss growing off them.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you have just
the regular green moss

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
you see growing on
rocks on a stream,

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:84%
let's say, on the
rest of the body.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And very, very small hands
and very, very small feet.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So you're saying that
this is not a natural species,

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:84%
but this was an
engineered life form?

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Correct.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Why would they want to
make a vegetable/hominid being?

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Is it for covert work
to conceal itself?

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It is.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:90%
It's for covert work.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.350 align:middle line:84%
They can go weeks without
eating, as long as they

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:90%
have sunlight and water.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:84%
They can make
their own nutrients

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:09.660 align:middle line:84%
through this plant
interaction with cells.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
fascinating science,

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
by the way, of how that
all is intertwined.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:15.930 align:middle line:90%
But they did it.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Did you ever get to
see or interact with a live

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:90%
moss being, as we can call it?

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, absolutely.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.891 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: OK, how
did it communicate?

00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It communicated
with its hands.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.015 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, a type
of sign language, yes.

00:21:30.015 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And what was the
feeling that you got from it?

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
How was its level of
intelligence, its level

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:90%
of ethics, its consciousness?

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I hate to say
negative, but it is a creepy,

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:90%
spooky type of being.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's very quiet
and it's very docile.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.515 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of a
chameleon that just kinda

00:21:49.515 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:84%
sits there and moves kinda
slowly, like a sloth.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're not very
hyperactive beings.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They're just a very
slow type of being.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.212 align:middle line:84%
And they are taught
from what I was told--

00:22:04.212 --> 00:22:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know this
for a fact, but I

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.430 align:middle line:84%
was told through
second-hand information

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that they were taught
at a very young age

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:84%
how to communicate because
they lack vocal cords.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh?

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So their face doesn't
move very much?

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.863 align:middle line:90%
You said it's very hardened?

00:22:19.863 --> 00:22:21.946 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, it's very
hardened, it barely moves,

00:22:21.946 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:90%
but they can chew.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Do their
eyes look like ours,

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.445 align:middle line:84%
or is there something
different about the eyes?

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: They're black.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:27.465 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: They're black?

00:22:27.465 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Black eyes.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.483 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: There is no pupil,
you cannot see their pupil.

00:22:32.483 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
They're pitch black, which
does frighten some people.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So what
would be the objective?

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
If they were going to deploy
these beings into the field,

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:84%
would these beings
actually be used

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.870 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the Earth?

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Would they be for surveillance?

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.479 align:middle line:84%
Would they be trained
to assassinate people?

00:22:49.479 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:90%
What would they be doing?

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Not to kill.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:84%
They're not that adept, but
definitely for surveillance.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what better creatures--
one that can't make a sound.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.920 align:middle line:90%


00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:90%
Engineered that way, by the way.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So give me an
example of where the military

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.250 align:middle line:84%
industrial complex would
deploy a being like this

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:90%
for surveillance purposes?

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.489 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it could
camouflage very well.

00:23:14.489 --> 00:23:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I can only speculate.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I was not part of
any deployment program to spy

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.060 align:middle line:90%
on with them.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So alls I can say is,
you will not know one

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.890 align:middle line:90%
if you even stepped on it.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're that
covered in whatever.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:84%
They can add foliage to
the mossy skin, by the way.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's say they're
going to an area

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle line:84%
where it needs these
types of colors.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So they can get fungi and
different types of moss

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and implant this
on the body, and it

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:46.930 align:middle line:90%
will grow into that skin.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, which
is fascinating.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So they can pretty
much mask any type

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:57.920 align:middle line:84%
of field grass, any type
of trees around the world.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.714 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So part of their
body would be like soil and you

00:24:00.714 --> 00:24:02.130 align:middle line:84%
could actually
plant things in it?

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It's not soil,
but it's a honeycomb matrix

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:84%
of collagen tissue that can
hold water for many, many weeks.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:90%
It's like a skin.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's embedded in the skin
and comes out of the skin,

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:84%
just like a honeycomb, but very
small, on a very small size,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:90%
micro-millimeter size.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So had you first
encountered these beings while

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:84%
you were still working full-time
in the underground base?

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, I did.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think because of these
beings coming from an Inner

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Earth place, they were somehow
able to grow things on them

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:42.840 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Oh, so you're saying
there was an initial stock

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.750 align:middle line:84%
of being that they got from the
Inner Earth that they modified.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And they mixed it
with more plant life and made it

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:55.585 align:middle line:90%
more into this robust creature.

00:24:55.585 --> 00:24:56.385 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:56.385 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So had you seen them
alive back when you worked

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:90%
in the underground base?

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.428 align:middle line:84%
Or was this more of
an autopsy situation?

00:25:02.428 --> 00:25:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I've seen
them grown, yes.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: How would
they be grown?

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: In a big glass
aquarium type-thing with UV

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.870 align:middle line:84%
lights, suspended off the
ground about three feet on these

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:90%
planter-type things.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So since we're
almost out of time here,

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm just curious if there's
anything else interesting about

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:84%
the moss being that you
could share with us?

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Absolutely.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: It's so bizarre.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: One of the most
amazing things is these things

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:90%
cannot procreate.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh?

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They do not
have organs like we do,

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:90%
but they do make seeds.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And these seeds
have DNA in them.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Now it's not full
of human tissue, OK?

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:90%
It's still all plant life.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I saw a
collection of these seeds

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.260 align:middle line:84%
in an incubator
when I was leaving.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of my
colleagues was talking

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.650 align:middle line:84%
about they're doing a new
experiment on another type

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.690 align:middle line:90%
of one of these moss beings.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And I asked why the
clearance for you

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:90%
to talk about it were very open.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:12.450 align:middle line:84%
He goes, no, but I can
show you the new incubators

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:13.740 align:middle line:90%
that were brought in.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And we were walking
by and I just

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:84%
remember looking through this
giant three-foot circular

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:24.270 align:middle line:84%
window and there was a seed
in there as big as you,

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.623 align:middle line:90%
a lot of them.

00:26:25.623 --> 00:26:27.555 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:26:27.555 --> 00:26:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And I really
was just taken aback.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And that was it--

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wasn't even
allowed to know anymore.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:90%
I was even allowed to speak.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Is it your
understanding that the seed

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.645 align:middle line:84%
could somehow be gestated and
become another one of these

00:26:42.645 --> 00:26:43.445 align:middle line:90%
beings?

00:26:43.445 --> 00:26:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: That's
what I'm thinking,

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.900 align:middle line:84%
or where did that
seed come from.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.440 align:middle line:90%
What dropped that seed?

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I mean, they're up to
some amazing things in there.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And there is no rules,
there's no regulations.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So could you tell
us what was the reason why you

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:84%
were called back in after you
had moved to Fort Myers to deal

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.380 align:middle line:90%
with this specific being again?

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.365 align:middle line:84%
What had happened or what was
the reasoning behind that?

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: There was an incident
on the lab and the team was

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.395 align:middle line:90%
destroyed.

00:27:19.395 --> 00:27:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: An incident?

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Could you be a
little more specific?

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.576 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, I would imply
from what you said that there

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.750 align:middle line:84%
was some sort of hostile
interaction with one of these

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, not
from the beings.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh, OK.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.757 align:middle line:84%
So for some reason
this is something

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:84%
that you really don't
want to tell us,

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.690 align:middle line:90%
or you were ordered not to say.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I just can't,
it's just too much.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:90%
I know those people, so.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.445 align:middle line:84%
It's too hard for
me to talk about.

00:27:50.445 --> 00:27:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us another
example of something

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:59.760 align:middle line:84%
interesting that you
were called back for when

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.485 align:middle line:90%
you were living in Fort Myers?

00:28:01.485 --> 00:28:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I did go back just
for the normal tissue sampling

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:05.880 align:middle line:90%
a couple of times.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was just because they
were short on technicians

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.650 align:middle line:90%
and short on staff.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I know there was an outbreak
one time in the facility,

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:18.780 align:middle line:84%
and 20% of the facility people
caught a very rare virus.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.391 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
hantavirus, I don't

00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:90%
know if it was the hantavirus.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.639 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I don't know if
you guys know about that.

00:28:24.639 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
outbreak of that in 1993.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:27.844 align:middle line:90%
And there's a virus.

00:28:27.844 --> 00:28:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: You're talking
about the hantavirus?

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:35.555 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And that virus,
that was actually made in that

00:28:35.555 --> 00:28:36.355 align:middle line:90%
facility.

00:28:36.355 --> 00:28:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: This is the
flesh-eating bacteria?

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, it gives you
more flu-like symptoms to death

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.060 align:middle line:90%
pretty quickly.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And you're ferociously
vomiting and diarrhea,

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and your lungs start to shut
down and it's hard to breathe.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So there was a similar virus
like that that actually

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:02.350 align:middle line:84%
broke out in the lab and
people were deathly ill.

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:07.802 align:middle line:84%
Almost 20% of the
biologics area was so sick

00:29:07.802 --> 00:29:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and they were not allowed
to return to service.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
They had to go to the hospital,
the underground hospital,

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:90%
and be quarantined.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.025 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:29:15.025 --> 00:29:16.795 align:middle line:84%
Were there are a
lot of casualties?

00:29:16.795 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, there was.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Half of it, 20% passed.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.626 align:middle line:84%
So you were brought in because
of your expertise on this

00:29:23.626 --> 00:29:25.000 align:middle line:84%
to try to help
stop the outbreak?

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, I actually was
just going so they could keep

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.799 align:middle line:90%
working, just normal work.

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Oh, you were
just like a fill-in.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I was just
a fill-in, just PRN.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: I'm curious--

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.630 align:middle line:84%
in just the last couple
of minutes we have here,

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about some
negative uses of this,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.570 align:middle line:84%
but I'm wondering if this
same technology could

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:90%
be used for positive purposes.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And if so, do you have any
specific knowledge about that?

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Funny thing you asked
that because part of this story

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I had to return to New Mexico
because of this outbreak

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.310 align:middle line:84%
of a virus that was made
there that 20% of the people

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:90%
contracted.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:84%
They designed a virus
to kill that virus.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh, really?

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And save the other
10% in less than a few days.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And it's really hard
to make a whole new species

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:84%
of bacteria or a virus
in just a couple of days.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:23.786 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They did not
have this on the shelf.

00:30:23.786 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:90%
I know that for sure.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But since then, they
have been able to make

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:33.417 align:middle line:84%
viruses that fight viruses or
bacteria that fight viruses.

00:30:33.417 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a good thing that
came out of it, even though it

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.790 align:middle line:84%
was a horrific,
horrific accident that

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.020 align:middle line:90%
happened in there.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is now being employed
in other civilian use places,

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.320 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's coming out really
slowly because they're

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.500 align:middle line:90%
doing a lot of data on it.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a positive thing.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I just know that through the
part of the hybrid things

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I was involved with they were
changing DNA with viruses.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was the easiest way to
mix a protein with a protein

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.610 align:middle line:90%
where it's accepted.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.710 align:middle line:90%
So the whole body would change.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
take those cells

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and grow it or
inoculate another being.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they kept
doing is inoculating beings

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over
with these different types

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:90%
of viruses.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
this super being.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So we could
have, for example,

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.870 align:middle line:84%
people starting to have
super visions, super hearing,

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:34.305 align:middle line:84%
psychic abilities perhaps,
all from these types

00:31:34.305 --> 00:31:35.105 align:middle line:90%
of inoculation.

00:31:35.105 --> 00:31:36.146 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: That's correct.

00:31:36.146 --> 00:31:38.244 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, that's
very fascinating.

00:31:38.244 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, Emery, I want to thank
you for coming forward.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:90%
This is very fascinating.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Very bizarre--

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:43.775 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Very bizarre.

00:31:43.775 --> 00:31:44.691 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Information.

00:31:44.691 --> 00:31:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the fact
that it's so bizarre

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.270 align:middle line:84%
makes me more inclined to
believe that it's true.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Because who would have
ever invented or thought

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:53.700 align:middle line:90%
of something like this?

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It's definitely
a hard nut to crack.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Yeah, that's for sure.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank
you for watching.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.640 align:middle line:84%
