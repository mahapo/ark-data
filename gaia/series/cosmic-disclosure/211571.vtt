[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:20.017 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.017 --> 00:00:21.850 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:10%
we are with Randy Cramer,
who has participated

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.340 align:middle line:10%
in a covert military space
program for 18 years called

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.840 align:middle line:10%
the Earth Defense Force.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking about
some of the main ET species.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER: Thanks
for having me here.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who are the predominant
species in our galaxy

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:90%
that you know of?

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, we have over
200,000 civilized worlds

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.740 align:middle line:84%
that are made up of by
thousands of different species

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and races of individuals
that are made up.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:84%
But we tend to break
them down into--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:84%
there are tremendous,
which are humanoid,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:84%
which does not necessarily
mean that they would all

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:90%
appear exactly human.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:84%
But there are a
tremendous number,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:90%
which are primate evolved.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:10%
So with the human humanoids
are actually a large chunk.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But you have older species
who've been around longer.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So you have reptoids
insectoids, again, over 200,000.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about, say,
a top 10 list of who's who

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.820 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy--

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: --sure.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Then we're talking about
probably the Centauri,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.740 align:middle line:90%
the Andromedans.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:90%
And we talk about the Pleiades.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
There's like 20 civilized
worlds there too.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:84%
So the Cortium, which
is actually probably

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
the most socially,
politically dominant species

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
in the Pleiades, kind
of breaks down more

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
into consortiums of
dominant biological types.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So insectoids tend to cloister
with other insectoids.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Reptiles tend to cloister
with other reptiles.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's more about
trade than anything else.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have more
to trade with someone who's

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.301 align:middle line:84%
the same species
as you than you're

00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:09.759 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
trade with someone

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:90%
who's not the same species.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So tell us
about the Andromedans.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:84%
They're a little
more like about--

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:84%
they're a little
taller than we are.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So when I say they're
close to human size,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
average height might
stand between 6 and 1/2

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.330 align:middle line:84%
or 7 feet tall, but not
much more than that.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.080 align:middle line:84%
If they walked into the
room, they'd seem bigger.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Or a short one might
still seem tall.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:84%
But you might not notice
right away from just heights

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:90%
that they're not a Terran.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually the other
things that are the giveaway.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So they don't wear
Terran clothes ever.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So usually, they're clothes
are smart fabrics, which

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:84%
are like temperature sensitive,
adjusting fabrics that

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
can keep you warm
when it's 20 below,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.255 align:middle line:90%
or cool when it's 125 degrees.

00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's
their skin color?

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Pretty fair tone too.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:84%
I would say more
white than pink.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.475 align:middle line:84%
My hands a little
more pink than white.

00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But they're probably a
little more white than pink.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.142 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they have a problem
with the sun in their system?

00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: My understanding is
that it's a blue star system.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a bit brighter.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.074 align:middle line:84%
But they're also a
little farther away.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So their Goldilocks zone is in
a little different spot than us.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
But, again, you wouldn't
notice too much from one

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.280 align:middle line:84%
walking in the room, except
they might be a little taller.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And they might be a little
broader in the shoulders

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:84%
because they tend to
be a little beefier.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell us a little bit
about their facial features

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:90%
like their eyes.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Eyes tend
to be brighter colors.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
one with brown eyes

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:90%
or like a really dark iris.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But they tend to be bluish,
greenish, lighter colors.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:84%
But I've seen some
odder colors too,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:84%
not like necessarily
colors that we have.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So even like pinker
tones, or redder tones,

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:90%
or orangish tones.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Some peculiar iris colors, to
me or you, might be peculiar.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.023 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other predominant
species can you tell us about?

00:04:10.023 --> 00:04:11.648 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Socially,
politically, again,

00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:84%
in certainly in this
quadrant of the galaxy,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:90%
the Cortium play a major role.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.970 align:middle line:84%
They are a Pleiadian
species, but they don't often

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
refer to themselves as
Pleiadians because, again,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:84%
seven stars, 20
civilized worlds,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot of civilizations
there actually.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So Pleiadian is a
very generic name.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:84%
More generic than
even calling us

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:84%
earthlings or soul
systemers, if we

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:84%
were a part of a larger
star system saying,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
those people over there,
which is super vague.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So the most specific name
that we can come up with

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.228 align:middle line:84%
to describe that
translates is the Cortium.

00:04:48.228 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Would you say they
have the predominantly most

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.005 align:middle line:84%
population of the species
you are talking about?

00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I don't
know if I'd call them

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:90%
the greatest population.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:84%
They are the centralized
social political entity

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:90%
in that star system.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So like most of the centers
for politics, trade, the head

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.090 align:middle line:84%
military and policing
center's sort of there.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So they really take on the goals
of organizational civilization,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:84%
which is on a galactic
level, is more bureaucracy,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:84%
more departments, more
specialists, more people.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So they've expanded
their idea about what

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:84%
politics and government
are to not just what they

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.200 align:middle line:84%
do on their own planet,
but think of what they

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:84%
do as being a Washington,
DC, or a Hong Kong,

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.620 align:middle line:84%
or a London that covers
a much broader territory

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.910 align:middle line:90%
of many, many planetoids.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So that it's a center point of
politics and civics, business,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and everything else that
they're doing there.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, does that species
also have separate races

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:90%
within the species?

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Most planets,
as it turns out,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
have more than one sentient
species that live there.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
More often than not,
you have layering.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So you have species
that live subterranean,

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
terranean on the surface,
or above the surface.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:84%
There are niches in
which different species

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:90%
occupy in a given world.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So most worlds don't have a
single developed occupant.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:90%
They have multiple species.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
We have four or five minimum
of our own on this planet.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So Mars has four or five
minimum, maybe six or seven,

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:84%
if I'm to understand
that correctly.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So as a dominant species,
there are other subspecies.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding is they
have an aquatic species that

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:90%
lives under the water.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.333 align:middle line:84%
They have another
subterranean species

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:90%
that also lives underground.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I believe, they're
also insectoid.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
But they, again,
still operate in

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:84%
this central social,
political zone for a majority

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:90%
of this quadrant of the galaxy.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are these species
interacting with us

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.578 align:middle line:90%
in the 3D or not?

00:07:19.578 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, absolutely.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.700 align:middle line:84%
We have trade arrangements
and treaty arrangements

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.080 align:middle line:90%
with all of these species.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
We have been entering
into and working

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
on trade arrangements, treaty
arrangements for decades now.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're deeply involved
in intergalactic affairs,

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.977 align:middle line:84%
and trade, and politics,
and the whole thing now.

00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We, meaning who,
Randy, for the audience?

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Terrans.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:84%
When I say, we, I mean, we, the
Terrans here on planet Earth.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
We are very involved
now, very involved.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.428 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you
mean, we're very involved?

00:07:52.428 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I mean very
involved in the sense

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that we, as a planet
of scientists,

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.080 align:middle line:84%
military, social
political participants,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.940 align:middle line:84%
have become very keenly
interested to be deeply engaged

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:84%
in the social
political structure

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:84%
of the intergalactic
structure that we have.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So we've become very interested
in becoming full participants

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:90%
in that process.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.970 align:middle line:84%
We're very interested in being
able to police our own space

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:90%
and the space nearby.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And that requires being in
good relations with everyone

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:84%
else who is in the larger
social political structure.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:84%
So that we are
authorized and sanctioned

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.367 align:middle line:84%
to do that by the appropriate
agencies and parties.

00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who are the
most challenging beings

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations that you
have come in contact with?

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I
mean, the Draconians

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.990 align:middle line:90%
always present a challenge.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why is that?

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Mostly because
they're mean and scary.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And they project a lot
of fear, mean, scary sort

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:90%
of -ness in there.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you give
us an example of that?

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They genetically
engineer and design

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:84%
their soldier combatants
to be terrifying.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost as if they
asked HR Giger to say, come up

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:19.340 align:middle line:84%
with the scariest thing that
you can and design that for us.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So it's a physical.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's not just psionics.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, no.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:90%
It's physical.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:90%
It's very creepy looking.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Everything that they
do, it's creepy looking.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.475 align:middle line:90%
It's dark and oogie.

00:09:30.475 --> 00:09:33.835 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
In the moment of it, it feels
overwhelming and terrifying

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:84%
because there's
a lot of psionics

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:84%
doing a lot of just
what's happening

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:90%
visually and psychologically.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But having encountered
it more than once,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I've broken it
down a little bit.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:90%
There's intent behind that.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that they have
a uncomfortable aesthetic

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
that we find grotesque
or something.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
The aesthetic that they're
using in their production

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:84%
of their military hardware
and their biological personnel

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:10.720 align:middle line:84%
has the design like, artistic
design to look creepy,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
to look scary, to
be frightening.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
accidental or just

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.250 align:middle line:90%
kind of that's how they look.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.140 align:middle line:84%
There's some intent to be
as scary and terrifying as

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are their normal
looking Draconians,

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:90%
as well, you would say?

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That's
a funny thing is

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
what I have seen is that
the normal ones don't

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:84%
look like what they think
that they look like at all.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So it appears from
what I have seen,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:84%
that they are appearing to be
a large, strong, fit reptoid.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:90%
When, in fact, they are not.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:84%
That is probably a
housing of some kind.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, I see.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Besides their
physical aspects, what

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.160 align:middle line:84%
about their technology,
their consciousness,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:90%
their political outlook?

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
What can you enlighten
us about that?

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, other than just
the physical mechanics

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:84%
of soldiers and
equipment, the black fog

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:84%
is probably the scariest
part, because it's psionic.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And it comes out in a field.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to
be like a black fog,

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:90%
like a black oozy fog.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how you can
even have black oozy fog.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But it looks like
a black oozy fog.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And it makes people
very uncomfortable.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.290 align:middle line:84%
To put it lightly, I've
seen people drop into a ball

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and curl up into
a fetal position

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and start crying in the
middle of that field,

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:90%
if they're not ready for it.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:90%
They're not used to it.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.145 align:middle line:84%
So some people makes
them very uncomfortable.

00:11:42.145 --> 00:11:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Some people can make
them just terrified.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're used to it, then
it makes you slightly uneasy.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.782 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
ready for it, it

00:11:50.782 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:90%
can be absolutely terrifying.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.782 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You portray
them very adversarial.

00:11:53.782 --> 00:11:55.842 align:middle line:84%
And is it always
that way with them?

00:11:55.842 --> 00:11:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, I
mean, they came--

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
From near as I understand,
they showed up in our galaxy,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.670 align:middle line:90%
some billions of years ago.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And we've been fighting
with them ever since.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So they seem to have a thing
that they don't like mammals,

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.102 align:middle line:90%
particularly, humanoid mammals.

00:12:10.102 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't like us
for some reason.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
They've been having it out for
us ever since they got here.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.403 align:middle line:84%
And we've been fighting
with them ever since.

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How much
more advanced is

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
our technology or their
technology compared

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.095 align:middle line:90%
to our technology?

00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That's an
interesting point.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:84%
They like to project, again,
that they are so much more

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:90%
advanced than everyone else.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:90%
But that's not really true.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
What they are is very good
at the technological cudgel.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So they are good
at technologies,

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.460 align:middle line:90%
which are brute force.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And there are technologies
that are small.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
They can still be thought
of as brute force in the way

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:90%
in which they are applied.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that
most of their--

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.442 align:middle line:84%
really, they're failing,
to be honest with you,

00:12:58.442 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
what would be considered
their strength--

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.530 align:middle line:90%
but I consider it a failing--

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
is their limitation of that
creativity of technology.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Technology is a cudgel to them.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It's something to use
to beat on someone,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:90%
or oppress, or dominate with.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's not often
used to subtlety.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.990 align:middle line:90%
But it's only so advanced.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize that, that
it's all about the cudgel.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize that
it's cudgel technology,

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't have a
lot of subtlety to it,

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes fairly
simple and straightforward

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:90%
to overcome.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.748 align:middle line:84%
It really just took us
a matter of years to do.

00:13:32.748 --> 00:13:34.290 align:middle line:84%
It was going to be
inevitable that we

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.870 align:middle line:84%
were going to figure it out
once we had enough technology.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When there's such a
large gap in our development,

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
why are they
interacting with us?

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Why are we so special?

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That's
a good question.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it probably has
something to do with the fact

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're a library planet,
which I talked about before.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.523 align:middle line:84%
I think that makes the
position of where we are

00:13:50.523 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and what value the planet,
and the information

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that it has on it quite
valuable and quite special.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.180 align:middle line:84%
But there could be
20 other reasons.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And half of it could just
be because they're lazy.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And they need slave labor,
and meat, and water.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they interacting
with us on their own?

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Or are they doing it through
a federation or organization?

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The
Draconian civilization

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:90%
is a corporate structure.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Their entire government,
their entire system

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.705 align:middle line:90%
is a corporate structure.

00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:22.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a corporate structure.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:90%
So it's profit motivated.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.140 align:middle line:90%
It's backstabby.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And you either are making
profits and making gains,

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
or someone might literally stab
you in the back at the board

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:90%
meeting and take your job.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Like, literally stab you.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, do you see
the human development

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:84%
on a similar path to any
other extraterrestrial society

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.345 align:middle line:90%
models?

00:14:49.345 --> 00:14:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It depends.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what happens
over the next 10 years.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
We were put on a corporatist
path by Draconians.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.257 align:middle line:84%
The corporate model
is not our model.

00:14:59.257 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not a humanoid model.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a Draconian model.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm going
to be quite blunt,

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
the majority of
problems that we have

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.530 align:middle line:84%
comes from the corporatist
structure and the mismanagement

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.575 align:middle line:84%
and abuse of the
corporatist structure.

00:15:14.575 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
business is bad.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Business can be good.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Business can be fair.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Business can be just.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Business can be clean.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Business can be all the
good things that it can be.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.842 align:middle line:84%
But corporatist structures are
designed to make them not so.

00:15:28.842 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they have
similar challenges,

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.622 align:middle line:84%
like we do, in the
corporate structures?

00:15:32.622 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I don't know that
I'd call it similar challenges.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.120 align:middle line:84%
I would say that their
structure is even

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:84%
meaner and nastier, and
more deadly than the one

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's saying something.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are we
developing independently?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Or are there outside
ET influences?

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Some of
both at this point.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.080 align:middle line:90%
We've been helped along the way.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:84%
But we are putting
a tremendous amount

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.780 align:middle line:84%
of time, energy, and money
into self-driven development

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:90%
as much as we can.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to be being
helped out for a while.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
any time soon that we're

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:84%
going to be totally on our
own and not being helped out

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:84%
by the other members of the
greater community of the galaxy

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.340 align:middle line:90%
at large.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.507 align:middle line:90%
We're doing the best we can.

00:16:16.507 --> 00:16:18.632 align:middle line:84%
But there's always going
to be someone helping out.

00:16:18.632 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, due to the
extreme polarities on Earth

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:84%
at this time, do you see any
human motives or agendas that

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.800 align:middle line:84%
are in conflict that there
are extraterrestrials

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.290 align:middle line:90%
influencing behind the scenes?

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.515 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, sure.

00:16:35.515 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:84%
That's a mouthful to try
and answer that other

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:84%
than to say that most of the
conflicts that we are seeing

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and that we are seeing them
vet themselves out a bit.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Give us an example.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, we're
seeing wars breaking out.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.770 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing potential
more wars breaking out.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing parties
who are attempting

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:84%
to take tremendous social,
political advantage

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.240 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:84%
To oversimplify,
there are those that

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:12.369 align:middle line:84%
would like some freedom
and some democracy

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:84%
where we get to vote for
what happens in our world

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
to be the dominant
way in which we live.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:84%
There are those who
would like fascism

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to be the dominant way
in which we live where

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.958 align:middle line:84%
some very tiny number
of people tell everybody

00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:90%
what they're going to do.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's the end of it.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Bad people, good people.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Good people want some
freedom and democracy.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Bad people want fascism.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And this works through the
galactic levels as well.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So those who are helping us to
be a little more free, and so

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
that we still get to vote on
things, are on the good side.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And those who are trying to take
that away are on the bad side.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And if it was so simple, again,
it would be already sorted out.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.435 align:middle line:84%
But it's not, which
is why we're in a war.

00:17:53.435 --> 00:17:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who are the
biggest influences

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.740 align:middle line:90%
on humanity at this time?

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It's a good question.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
There are certainly
a number of the--

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:84%
the Galactic Senate right
now is very involved

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:90%
in our transition.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.830 align:middle line:84%
So that whatever
we're here to do,

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and whatever we're
transitioning in,

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:84%
they're very involved in the
observational part of that,

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:84%
as well as some of the
management part of that,

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:84%
as well as some of the
operational part of that.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.657 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And for the audience,
Randy, the Galactic Senate,

00:18:21.657 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:90%
go ahead and give us a--

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:84%
That is the largest operational
body, governing body

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
in the galaxy in which
participating worlds

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations have a
seat, have a representation

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:90%
in that Senate.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Policy is discussed.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Votes are taken.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Decisions are made.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.978 align:middle line:84%
And people are sent
out to go do work

00:18:44.978 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:84%
based on votes and
decisions that are made.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it planet to
planet, or solar system

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:53.260 align:middle line:84%
to solar system, or
galaxy to galaxy?

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:90%
The representation, I mean.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It's everything.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.445 align:middle line:90%
It's always start small--

00:18:58.445 --> 00:18:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Like a tier.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.487 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: --and goes bigger.

00:19:00.487 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:90%
It's always tiered.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:84%
We have municipal politics,
county politics, state

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:90%
politics, federal politics.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.770 align:middle line:84%
You have similar
tiers that start

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.430 align:middle line:84%
at what the lowest level of
interactive civil government is

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:90%
and the highest levels.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So if we go above
federal here, you

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
go into global, galactic,
solar system quadrant totality.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So there are levels of which
we are engaged and participate

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:84%
in those conversations,
questions, votes,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:90%
policy conversations.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.367 align:middle line:84%
So that we can help run
the galaxy that we live in.

00:19:40.367 --> 00:19:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Out of all
the species you've

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.470 align:middle line:84%
mentioned during this
program, which would you

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
say have the best interest
for Earth and its inhabitants?

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Certainly,
the creator species--

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:84%
what we refer to as the creator
species, the oldest ones--

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.130 align:middle line:84%
they seem to have just the
clearest best intentions

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:90%
for everybody.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Their main goal is just, we
want everybody to do better.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:84%
We want every
species to grow up.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.100 align:middle line:90%
We want every planet to evolve.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:84%
We want every civilization
to make progress.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:84%
They're like the oldest
great, great, great, great

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:84%
grandparents, just
wanting all the great,

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.600 align:middle line:90%
great grandkids to be OK.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And so their main goal is to
just working with everybody

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to make the entire
universe a better place.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Many people talk
about creator species,

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.563 align:middle line:84%
but there are so
many different kinds.

00:20:29.563 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:84%
From your perspective, who
are these creator species?

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:84%
There are many of which I have
only personally encountered

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.120 align:middle line:90%
two.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So the bronze ones, as
they're often referred

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.450 align:middle line:84%
to, and the [NON-ENGLISH]
or the [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:84%
which are the only two
species that I've personally

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.360 align:middle line:84%
encountered of those that are
millions of years old, meaning,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:55.120 align:middle line:84%
an individual being, person of
that species lives for millions

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:10%
So just talking about a
completely different scaling

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:10%
for life, life experience,
life expectancy, what

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.470 align:middle line:10%
you expect to happen over time.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.960 align:middle line:84%
They have a whole different
perspective on it,

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:84%
which has a lot to do with
probably what they do,

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and why they do it
because they have

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
a bit of much longer greater
perspective of the scaling

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:90%
of all of that than we ever do.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:23.048 align:middle line:84%
So they're always looking big,
big picture for everybody.

00:21:23.048 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's go in a little
bit more detail about those two

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:90%
specific species.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
The bronze ones, which we
call them that because that's

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.260 align:middle line:90%
kind of their skin tone.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:84%
It's they're kind
of bronzy colored.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.260 align:middle line:84%
They have evolved past
language or needs of words.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So names are kind
of weird for them.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's more like, call
us whatever you want.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And we're like, OK.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:90%
And we came up with bronze.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.320 align:middle line:84%
We'll call you the
bronze one, whatever.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a name that
they call themselves anymore.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't refer to things
that they do or themselves

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.470 align:middle line:84%
in terms of language
because they left language

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
like a really, really,
really long time ago.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding
is when they basically

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:84%
became spacefaring
species, they came

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:84%
into a universe that was
very empty with a lot

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.260 align:middle line:84%
of primordial worlds
and a lot of stars

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:90%
that were still forming.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.070 align:middle line:90%
So it was a very young universe.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.973 align:middle line:84%
And instead of just going
all around and being like,

00:22:20.973 --> 00:22:23.140 align:middle line:84%
well, there's nothing out
here, they were like, hey,

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.580 align:middle line:84%
look at all this fertile
soil to plant in,

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and decided to just
see individual--

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Start creating.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Basically, this is how they've
described it to me anyways.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Look, we come across a planet.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Go, there's a garden.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.780 align:middle line:90%
What can we plant there?

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.860 align:middle line:90%
What can we fertilize?

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:84%
What does it need in order
to habitat something?

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it having a chemical
balance of something

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.010 align:middle line:90%
that can evolve there?

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Or does it need more oxygen, or
less oxygen, or more methane,

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:90%
or more ammonia?

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Or depending on
what we're making,

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:84%
what does this need to develop
something that can grow?

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that including all
biological entities on Earth?

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That would include
everything everywhere

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.435 align:middle line:84%
for billions of years, for
a really, really long time.

00:23:09.435 --> 00:23:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Including species.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, everything.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything everywhere,
some creator species

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.420 align:middle line:84%
came along a long
time ago, planted

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:84%
seeds, messed with
the soil, messed

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:84%
with the air and the
water to try and make it

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.420 align:middle line:90%
a habitable zone for something.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, like our very
own planet, that can change.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Our original design for
biological development

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:84%
was for giant plants
and giant animals.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, at some point,
someone decided

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that giant plants
and giant animals

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:90%
weren't going to work here.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided to
change the ecosystem.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And let's make the
plants smaller so

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.210 align:middle line:90%
that the animals get smaller.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And let's do something in
a different scale here.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, you
start somewhere.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you change over
time and go, oh, no.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Dinosaurs, maybe, that was
not where we're going to go.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe they evolved.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.740 align:middle line:84%
They were like, oh, Saurian
evolved species, great.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.380 align:middle line:84%
We got dinosaurs to
make spaceships, cool.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.820 align:middle line:90%
And then they left.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Hit it with a meteor.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And then let's start over and
work with the little marmosets

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.380 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.172 align:middle line:84%
And let's see if we
can make some of those.

00:24:15.172 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So these things can take
massive amounts of time

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.917 align:middle line:84%
and aren't necessarily
ends into themselves.

00:24:22.917 --> 00:24:24.750 align:middle line:84%
They're just, well,
this is what we're doing

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:90%
for this 200 million years.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, maybe
we'll do something different.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And their essential goal is
to create enough species who

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:40.920 align:middle line:84%
can evolve, who can police
the space in which they live

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.460 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
enough of the bronze ones

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.720 align:middle line:90%
to police the freaking universe.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the goal is to have
an evolved species everywhere

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:84%
that can police their own
space, and keep it safe,

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.165 align:middle line:90%
and keep it healthy.

00:24:55.165 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:84%
There are some horrible
things that can

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:57.940 align:middle line:90%
happen, if that doesn't happen.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.648 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
necessarily into that.

00:24:59.648 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
But their goal is
just to do that,

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and to have somebody in charge
sovereign in every corner.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So when I was having
this conversation,

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.230 align:middle line:84%
this person saying, wow,
that's an amazing goal.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.130 align:middle line:84%
How long is that
supposed to take?

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, it's maybe
about 20 million years,

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.222 align:middle line:90%
start to finish.

00:25:23.222 --> 00:25:24.180 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, my god.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.865 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe that.

00:25:25.865 --> 00:25:27.073 align:middle line:90%
He's like, saying no, no, no.

00:25:27.073 --> 00:25:28.230 align:middle line:90%
We're 18 million years in.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
We only got two
million years left.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:90%
We're almost done.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Two million years left,
we're almost done.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.768 align:middle line:84%
It was a mind blower for
someone to go, no, no, no,

00:25:36.768 --> 00:25:38.310 align:middle line:84%
two million years,
we're almost done.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:84%
But the scale of that, if
your noggin can crank it,

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:84%
which is you have a goal that's
going to take 20 million years.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.960 align:middle line:90%
And you're most of the way done.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But you still got two
million years left.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is
that end goal then?

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That every
localized area of space--

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.337 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --will have
an evolved species

00:26:00.337 --> 00:26:02.077 align:middle line:90%
to police its own area of space.

00:26:02.077 --> 00:26:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Take care of their own.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So they're only
two million years away

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.757 align:middle line:84%
from the universe
supposedly being stable.

00:26:07.757 --> 00:26:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: From your
experiences, where do you

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:84%
see our humanity
going in relation

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:90%
to our evolutionary path?

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Up or away.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So we either get to
evolve and move up,

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.640 align:middle line:84%
or we get to go
away for a minute.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
we're going to go away.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think we get
to go up and evolve.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.408 align:middle line:90%
But it's one way or the other.

00:26:28.408 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:84%
There's no middle
ground, where we can just

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:84%
keep doing what we're doing
for another 50 or 100 years.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:84%
It's either we get
to go up and evolve,

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.770 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to go
back to being Bronze Age

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:41.103 align:middle line:90%

information, Randy.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that, as well,
that we will be evolving.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.
