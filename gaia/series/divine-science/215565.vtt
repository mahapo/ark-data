that guide our health.

These practices have been
around for thousands of years,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%

is an energy system.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:10%
We have electrical
currents and conduits

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:10%
that run through every
part of our bodies.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:10%

mapped these conduits,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:10%

persistent and
continuous health.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:10%
>> How they're believed to work
is that there is a non-physical

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:10%
energy that is directed through
the practitioner to effect

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:10%
change in the human body.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.060 align:middle line:84%
There is an innate wisdom
to this energy healing,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.900 align:middle line:84%
in that the practitioner
doesn't necessarily

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:84%
need to orchestrate the way that
the energy moves to invigorate

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:90%
it and support self-healing.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this invisible force be
linked to a physical phenomenon

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:10%
Over a century ago,
Alexander Gurwitsch

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:10%
discovered that our
bodies emit biophotons--

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:10%
particles of light
that may hold clues

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:10%
to how energy influences
healing and cellular function.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.560 align:middle line:10%
>> A simple way to think about
energy of the body is if we

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:10%
think about a light bulb.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
A light bulb emits
particles of light

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
which are called photons
or the sun emits photons.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Now our bodies emit
particles of light

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:84%
also, which are
biophotons because it's

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:90%
from a biological organism.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things discovered is

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:84%
that it's got the
ability to influence

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
cell proliferation,
which is ultimately

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:84%
has to do with healing
and also disease.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Cell proliferation, the
process by which cells grow

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and divide, is essential for
healing and maintaining balance

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Research suggests that
biophotons play a critical role

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:84%
in regulating this
process, influencing

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
cellular communication in
various health conditions.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
This profound connection between
light energy and cellular health

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
opens new possibilities
for understanding healing

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:90%
at a deeper level.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So I started seeing that
connection between light energy

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and cell proliferation
and disease.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:90%
And so it was eye opening.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So the next step was I
started looking at, well,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
how do I influence
this light energy?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I began
to see studies that

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.660 align:middle line:84%
showed that there was
a direct correlation

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:84%
between our own thoughts
and emotions and energy.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And there were studies
that showed participants

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:90%
visualizing white light.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And they would have increased
biophoton emissions out

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.350 align:middle line:84%
of the right side of their
head, but not the left,

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.370 align:middle line:90%
or even in a state of anger.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:84%
You could see that the
mind and the biophoton

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:84%
emissions that there was a
direct correlation between that.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, I help
people to shift their mindset

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:84%
to ultimately
influence their energy,

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:90%
to then heal their bodies.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>> If our thoughts and emotions
can influence the energy within

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:84%
our bodies, could they also
affect the very building blocks

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.650 align:middle line:90%
of life itself?

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Emerging research
suggests a profound link

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.370 align:middle line:84%
between human emotion,
biophotons, and DNA,

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.880 align:middle line:84%
offering new
insights into how we

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:84%
might shape our health and the
very nature of our reality.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:10%
>> There are a couple of really
profound experiments I'd like

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:10%
to share.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:84%
One of those was performed
through the Institute

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:84%
of HeartMath back
in the early 1990s.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:84%
The first part of
the experiment was

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.830 align:middle line:90%
they took pristine human DNA.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
pristine, that means

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
it hasn't been exposed to the
degradation of ultraviolet light

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:90%
and toxins in the environment.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's pristine DNA.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And they isolated that DNA.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.570 align:middle line:84%
They put it into
a saline solution.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And they placed that DNA into
a special container of photons.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Now here's why
this is important.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Photons are the
primal building blocks

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
of the stuff this
world is made of.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.640 align:middle line:84%
DNA is the primal building block
of what our biology is made of.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So they're exploring
the relationship

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
between the stuff we're
made of and the stuff

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:90%
the world is made of.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So they have a vase
of photons, and they

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:84%
are measuring the location of
the photons, the distribution

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:90%
within the vase.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:84%
What the instrument
showed is the photons

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.230 align:middle line:90%
are completely random.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.580 align:middle line:90%
That's totally what we'd expect.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the first part
of the experiment.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:90%
No surprises.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Now they take the pristine
DNA, and they put it

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:90%
into the photons.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they measure
the alignment,

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
the arrangement of
those photons again.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
was the photons

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
are no longer random,
that the presence

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.730 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA with the photons
caused the photons to align

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:90%
along the axis of the DNA.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:84%
What they're showing is
that the stuff we're made of

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.670 align:middle line:84%
has an influence on the
stuff this world is made of.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the first
times scientifically,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.697 align:middle line:84%
we've been able to see
this on an energetic level.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, where the experiment
got really interesting

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:84%
is that they took that DNA
and they measured what's

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:84%
called the conformation,
the shape of the DNA

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of
different kinds of emotion.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So they had the
DNA in the presence

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:84%
of joyous images of nature,
frightening images of war,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%
humorous images of comedy.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.330 align:middle line:84%
What they found was
that the DNA actually

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:84%
began to unwind as if it were
going to replicate itself.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:84%
What this is showing is
that human emotion affects

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:90%
the stuff our world is made of.

studies showing its potential

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.700 align:middle line:84%
to reduce pain in cases where
conventional treatments had

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.420 align:middle line:90%
provided little relief.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.150 align:middle line:10%

any relief from other types

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:84%

were given a session

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:90%
of energy medicine healing.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%

reduction happened

across these 200 people.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:10%
>> We asked each
client beforehand,

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:10%
did they believe that
this was going to work?

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.610 align:middle line:10%
Some of them said yes,
and some of them said, no.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Overall, we found that
there was no correlation

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:84%
between their prior
belief and whether or not

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.580 align:middle line:84%
they actually experienced
a reduction in pain.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's not entirely
clear that whatever

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
it is that the healers are
doing, they still got better.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.570 align:middle line:84%

well, any kind of energy
medicine technique

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
is simply a placebo

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.780 align:middle line:90%

but an unexpected
effect also emerged.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.470 align:middle line:84%
The healers had been asked
to wear a small vial of water

around their necks

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.790 align:middle line:84%
The scientists found that the
molecular bonds of this water

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:90%
had changed as well.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Unlike humans, water does
not rely on personal belief

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.820 align:middle line:84%
or expectation, making
it an ideal medium

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:84%
to test whether energy healing
produces measurable effects

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:90%
beyond the placebo response.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Since our bodies are
made mostly of water,

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:84%
the idea is maybe the water
would register some change

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:84%
as a result of this
healing energy exchange.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we took this water
before and after the healing

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and put it in a
spectrophotometer.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And we did see evidence of
the bond changing a bit.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So this was really exciting
because again, there's

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.760 align:middle line:84%
no placebo apparently
in this bottle of water,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:90%
this little vial of water.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that's some indication
that there's something other

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:90%
than placebo going on.

there's no magic in the chant.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.850 align:middle line:10%

reinforce within them

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:10%
what it is that was happening.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:84%

experiments we had with petri

dishes is when it was

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:84%
collaboration with Dean Radin
at the Institute of Noetic

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Sciences.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So we had the
biological targets,

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and then Dean brought in
these physical targets,

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:90%
these random number generators.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:84%
These are machines that are
very good at spitting out

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.280 align:middle line:90%
random numbers.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And Dean's theory was that if
we have a coherence of mind when

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.080 align:middle line:84%
we have this healing
occurring, it

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
would influence the local
physics of the space

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.440 align:middle line:90%
to make it more coherent.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And this would restrain the
random number generators,

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.367 align:middle line:84%
and they would
become less random.

00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It appears to be something
like a field effect,

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.370 align:middle line:84%
because these random generators
that are running typically

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.220 align:middle line:84%
in the background-- nobody
even knows that they're there--

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:84%
they will start to
become less random,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
almost as though the coherence
that the healer is producing

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:84%
is also affecting aspects
of the environment.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And so a number of
studies have been

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:84%
done showing that
there's something

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
like a informational change that
is occurring when the healers do

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.080 align:middle line:90%
their thing.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So what a healer seems
to do is create coherence

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:90%
within the body.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Dean Radin had put
one generator in the box,

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:84%
one outside the box, and
another a mile or two away.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And the distance had
no effect on that.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So this was the first time that
basically a biological target

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and a physical target were
looked at the same time.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I think that's one
of the most compelling results

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:84%
that I've found with
energy medicine.

and physical systems.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But the true significance lies
in how these practices are being

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:84%
applied to alleviate
suffering in patients

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.290 align:middle line:84%
across a wide range
of conditions.

data together as a whole,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:84%
we see from these clinical
studies that Reiki,

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:84%
therapeutic touch, healing
touch, and other practices,

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:84%
including laying on of hands are
incredibly effective at reducing

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
pain, fatigue, and improving
mental health in a variety

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:84%
of patients, including
those with immune disorders,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:84%
with cancer, with
pain disorders,

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and with mental health
afflictions like post-traumatic

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:90%
stress.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.260 align:middle line:84%
These effects of energy
healing practices

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
on mental and emotional
health are incredibly strong,

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.140 align:middle line:84%
meaning not only are they
statistically significant,

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:84%
but they're clinically
significant.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about massive
reductions in suffering.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you look at the meta
analysis of methods like Reiki,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:84%
you find that overall is pretty
good evidence that it helps,

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I would say, in general, with
problems that are related more

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.420 align:middle line:84%
to mental effects
rather than physical.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And by that, what I mean is that
you're using a energy medicine

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.610 align:middle line:90%
technique for treating of pain.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Pain is in the mind.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's there
physically too,

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:84%
but the feeling of it,
the internal sense of it

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:90%
is a mental thing.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And so it looks like these
energy medicine techniques

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:84%
are very effective when it
comes to treatment of what might

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.700 align:middle line:90%
be called a mental effect.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>> While mindset
shapes recovery,

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
evidence shows energy healing
can produce profound shifts

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:84%
in both mind and body that
defy conventional explanations.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So the question is, does the
person receiving the healing

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:90%
need to buy in?

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Do they need to believe that the
healing is possible for them?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.890 align:middle line:90%
The answer is interesting.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Technologically,
the person does not

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:84%
need to believe that the
healing is possible initially.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:04.080 align:middle line:90%
So the healing can happen.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:84%
However, if they continue
to see themselves as sick,

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:84%
diseased, and broken,
they're reinforcing

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.650 align:middle line:84%
the template of the
illusion of the sickness.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:90%
And often it will return.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:84%
People that have cancer
and they will go in,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and the doctors will remove
the physical expression.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:26.720 align:middle line:90%
They'll use a scalpel.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.710 align:middle line:90%
They'll use a laser.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.215 align:middle line:90%
They'll use chemotherapy.

00:19:29.215 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, OK,
well, we got it.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And six months later, they
say, well, it came back.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Why did it come back?

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
If the person has not undergone
an emotional or a psychological

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:45.010 align:middle line:84%
shift to heal the trauma,
which is typically

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:49.610 align:middle line:84%
what is triggering these kinds
of conditions in the body,

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:54.170 align:middle line:84%
that template is not conducive
to the lasting healing.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Rather than if they feel
themselves it's gone.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.015 align:middle line:90%
I have a new lease on life.

00:20:00.015 --> 00:20:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to love my family
like I've never loved before.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.057 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go do
all the things I ever

00:20:04.057 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:90%
wanted to do before.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:84%
That's a very, very
different way of thinking.

including chemotherapy

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:19.115 align:middle line:84%
and radiation, if they're given
things like healing touch while

00:20:19.115 --> 00:20:21.490 align:middle line:84%
they're going through treatment,
they're able to maintain

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
their immune system and prevent

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:90%
through those treatments.

The work in cancer is
continued to be explored even

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.730 align:middle line:84%
beyond humans, in cells and

exploring how energy is
getting under the skin

electrical communication

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
between cells so that the
signaling pathways are altered,

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and cancer cells don't
spread as quickly

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.420 align:middle line:84%
as they would if they weren't
receiving energy healing.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing effects
of energy healing

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.900 align:middle line:84%

out how to do with using drugs.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:05.090 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the expression
of what is called PD-L1

involved in signaling cancer

altering the expression of

through mechanisms far beyond
our current understanding,

whether electromagnetic fields

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:84%
energy healing or
biofield healing.

If they were if it was just
electromagnetic fields alone,

how would distant healing work?

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't quite explain that.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Our current
definitions of energy

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
is that it drops
off at a distance.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And yet we know from
the data that there

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:26.640 align:middle line:84%
are effects with distant healing
that are harder to explain.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:84%
This is where we begin to invoke
the question of whether quantum

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:84%
entanglement may be the most
efficient explanation for energy

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.650 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for us to
recognize that entanglement

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.980 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't just be an explanation
for distant healing,

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
but it would be an
explanation for all healing.

In science, we use something
called Occam's razor.

the most simple explanation

This is why conventional science
has a really hard time believing

00:23:03.607 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:84%

have to throw out everything.

Occam's razor works
in many cases.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
But when we're looking at
something like energy healing,

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:84%
we may say, even if
it is entanglement,

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:84%
does that mean placebo
factors don't play a role?

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that
electromagnetic fields

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.140 align:middle line:90%
don't play a role?

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:90%
No, it's probably all of it.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, it probably
is entanglement.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.030 align:middle line:84%
We could measure it in
electromagnetic fields.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And we could measure it
with placebo factors.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:47.210 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make sense.
