happening in the scientific

community around the
consciousness of plants.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:10%
Already the word
"intelligence" alone,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:10%
when we talk about
plants, it scares

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.440 align:middle line:10%
people, the idea that plants
are intelligent beings.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.260 align:middle line:10%
And then when you move
forward to consciousness,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:10%
the human neurobiology
world wants

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:10%
you to believe
that consciousness

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:10%
is something that is completely
relegated to the brain.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:84%
But we know that there's
multiple theories

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And so the other side
of the debate says,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
no, plants are conscious because
they are aware of themselves.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
They can take in
multiple pieces of input

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and then make decisions on
that input, in other words,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:84%
adapt or accept or
transform or change,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:90%

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that they
have a self-awareness

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%

so far as to say that animals

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:10%
with the idea of sunlight,
then at some point

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.400 align:middle line:10%
removed that light.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And what she found was
the plants deviated

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
from their normal, this
is where the sunlight

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:84%
is, and grew towards
the fan noise,

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.450 align:middle line:84%
saying that plants actually
made a decision to associate

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.580 align:middle line:84%
themselves to the fan noise
rather than to other things.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the
various types of examples

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:84%
of studies that are starting to
get carried out right now that

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.780 align:middle line:84%
starts to show as
agency, the idea

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:84%
that plants are
capable of taking

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:84%
in multiple types of input
and then choosing which path

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.770 align:middle line:90%
that they are going to take.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:84%
The problem is not the
plants communicating with us.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The problem is human beings
listening to the plants,

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:84%
because once we start
to recognize plants

brain of the plants,

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
you will find it mostly
in the soil and the roots.

And the other aspects
are the expression.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:10%
So they communicate with each
other, either through the roots

have where we can look down

bit blind when

why don't we create a device

musical instrument for plants.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:84%
It allows the plants to

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.540 align:middle line:84%
to choose the frequencies
that they want in order

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.403 align:middle line:84%
to be able to make
melody and make sounds.

00:16:17.403 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The way the Music of the

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.270 align:middle line:84%
an alligator clip that
is connected to a leaf.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:10%
And it collects the electrical
frequency of the plant.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Then there is a grounding
prod that goes into the soil.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And that grounding prod picks
up the electrical frequency

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:90%
of the root system.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:10%
And between the two of them,
it completes a frequency

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.680 align:middle line:10%
and collects a complete
frequency of the plants.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:10%
And then that frequency is sent
into the Music of the Plants

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:10%
box, because the box is
a biofeedback system.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So that frequency goes into
the biofeedback system,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
who then sends it to a
built-in midi synthesizer

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and translates that frequency
that it has collected

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:90%
from the plant into sound.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the sound is
sent back to the plant.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.832 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, in
layman's terms,

00:17:07.832 --> 00:17:09.290 align:middle line:84%
the simplest way
to understand this

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.690 align:middle line:84%
is the Music of the
Plants' equipment

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.450 align:middle line:84%

importance of it is the fact

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that we tend to think
of music as a language.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.260 align:middle line:84%

matter is that language

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:90%

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So I carried out a
study that allowed

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
us to see what were the
effects of having healing

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.190 align:middle line:84%

and what changes

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.260 align:middle line:84%
to some of the
different diseases

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:84%
that we were testing for--
diabetes or hypertension

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:90%
or thyroidism.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.573 align:middle line:84%
And there's also been
many other studies

00:18:52.573 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:84%
that have happened around
the world around the Music

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.690 align:middle line:84%

people have looked

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:01.180 align:middle line:84%
into things like blood thickness

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:90%

into healing from comas

and physical therapy.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So we are seeing
that the plants are

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
able to use the music in
order to enhance their healing

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:90%

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.310 align:middle line:90%
a deeper question emerges.

How does this auditory bridge

redefine our understanding of
interspecies communication?

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And are we perhaps on the
threshold of a new realm

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience,
what we've discovered

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:84%
is that the plants
have this divine way

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:84%
of being able to connect
to the human energy field

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and know exactly what we
need when we need it, and are

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:84%
able to somehow transfer
that knowledge, that benefit,

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that healing, whatever term
you want to use, to the human

through the sound.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And my research has not been
able to support this yet.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
But I do have a hypothesis that
there is something more coming

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
through the music than
just the sound that

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:84%
gets sent into the
skin of the body that

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:90%

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.560 align:middle line:84%
It could be said to
be psychological.

Psychological is also
important, in knowing

It's not just those

But when a mother
or a father prepares

00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:84%
the food with true love, there
is an additional value there.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that value
carries on from the plant

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
as a plant in nature
