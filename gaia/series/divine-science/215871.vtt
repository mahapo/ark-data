00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:10%
The reason it came about is
because the US government

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:10%
had been hearing reports at
the time from the Soviet Union

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:10%

from a distance of almost any
type that you can imagine.

at the time or somewhere else

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:10%
And I had to sit in that
room with a marker and paper

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:10%
and duplicate the drawings
that were inside the sealed

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:10%
envelopes.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.560 align:middle line:10%
>>TARG: And as they hurry,
I've got a picture, a line

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle line:10%
drawing of something or other.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows what it is
because the envelope has not

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:90%
been opened.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you describe
what I have in my envelope?

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GELLER: And I
was 100% correct.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Some drawings where
millimetrically the same size.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the most complicated,
one was a bunch of grapes.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:90%
They drew 24 grapes.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.370 align:middle line:90%
I got 24 grapes.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:84%
If you measure the size of
the grape, it's the same size.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.990 align:middle line:90%
It's really incredible.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TARG: And we did a
dozen or so experiments

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:35.020 align:middle line:84%
like that, which we
published in Nature magazine.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And Geller did extremely
well, surprisingly well,

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.597 align:middle line:84%
in these double-blind
experiments.

00:09:43.597 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RADIN: Other methods
used in laboratories,

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.480 align:middle line:84%
called the Outbounder
experiments, where we would say,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:84%
we're going to take
one of your friends

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.390 align:middle line:90%
to a randomly selected spot.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.137 align:middle line:84%
And we want you to describe
what they're experiencing now,

00:09:57.137 --> 00:09:58.720 align:middle line:84%
where they are or
what they're looking

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:84%
at, what their emotions
are, the whole thing.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is partially where
the idea of remote viewing

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.090 align:middle line:90%
came from.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:84%
You're viewing that
space through their eyes.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.120 align:middle line:90%
You're remote viewing them.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the remote person
will take pictures and record

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.430 align:middle line:84%
sketches and things
about that place.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And now, a judge is shown
five or six images of places.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And now, given the transcript
of where the person actually was

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and what the remote
viewer said and say,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.815 align:middle line:84%
well, can you
match up these two,

00:10:29.815 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:84%
match what the
remote viewer said

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
versus these potential places
that they were brought to?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And so in the lab, you'd end
up with a hit rate of, say,

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:84%
1 in 5, 20% hit rate if there
were five possible targets.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And so those kind of
types of experiments

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.183 align:middle line:90%
were very, very successful.

00:10:44.183 --> 00:10:46.120 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the most compelling
evidence for remote viewing

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
comes not from laboratories but
from real-world intelligence

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.490 align:middle line:90%
operations.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.560 align:middle line:10%
Though many of these
cases remain classified,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:10%
declassified reports confirm
that remote viewers provided

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:10%
accurate descriptions
of enemy facilities,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:10%
advanced technologies,
and secret operations,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:10%
often years before confirmation
through conventional means.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GELLER: The remote viewing
that I've done for secret

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:90%
services--

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't really call
it remote viewing.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I call it ESP, telepathy,
extrasensory perception,

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:90%
mind reading.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And the missions I
was asked to do--

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I remember when the FBI
had a problem in locating

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.040 align:middle line:90%
a serial killer in New York.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:45.610 align:middle line:84%
His name was David
Berkowitz, the Son of Sam.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.850 align:middle line:90%
They put out a map on an easel.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.080 align:middle line:90%
I ran my hand over the map.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And I pointed at a house
in Yonkers, New York.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:84%
That's where David
Berkowitz was arrested.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.290 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TARG: When I was working
at SRI for the CIA,

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:84%
they said, well, why don't we
see if you can look into a place

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that we have a lot of
interest in and can't get to?

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So they gave me a slip
of paper, an envelope.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And I went with Pat Price,
went up to a shielded room.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.590 align:middle line:84%
The price said, well,
I'm laying on the top

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:90%
of a three-story building.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Sun feels good on my body.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And the giant crane rolling
back and forth over me

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.080 align:middle line:84%
has four wheels on either
side of the railroad tracks.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:10%
And he drew a
picture of the crane,

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.580 align:middle line:10%
which is now a famous
early remote viewing hit.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And Price said, well, I don't
know what they're making.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But I see men in
white lab coats.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.190 align:middle line:84%
They're speaking
another language.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:59.770 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to weld
together a giant steel

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
sphere out of gauze which
are orange peel slices.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to weld together
these orange peel slices.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:90%
And I'll draw those for you.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And we then show
those to the CIA

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, that's
very interesting.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
anything about it.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.110 align:middle line:10%
Two years after his
description, the facility

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:10%
was taken down in
Soviet Siberia.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And we could see the 60-foot
sphere having been rolled out

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:90%
of the building.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.460 align:middle line:10%
And you can see men
standing on the sphere,

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:10%
polishing up the gores,
just as Price had described.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:10%
So we know for a fact that Price
was able to describe these steel

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:10%
spheres as they were in Soviet
Siberia 6,000 miles away.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCMONEAGLE: Most
significant target

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I ever did for any of the
intelligence agencies--

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:84%
they had a building north of
the Arctic Circle in Russia.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.950 align:middle line:90%
It was on a peninsula.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.120 align:middle line:90%
And it was next to a harbor.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But it was not
connected to the harbor.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:14.680 align:middle line:84%
It was so huge, you could
put the Mall of the Americas

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:90%
in Minneapolis inside.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:90%
And it wouldn't touch anything.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And they had been watching this
building for like five years.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what
was going on in there.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:90%
They had a lot of conjecture.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:90%
But they really wanted to know.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:90%
And nobody could figure it out.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.057 align:middle line:84%
And so they passed
it to us as a target.

00:14:33.057 --> 00:14:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RADIN: One of the things
that Joe was able to do

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
is he was asked to
look at a building that

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.908 align:middle line:84%
was near a channel of water
but not connected to it.

00:14:43.908 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Like, what are they
doing in that building?

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Because that's like a
shipyard or something.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So he psychically looks
into the building.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And he sees the
largest submarine

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.158 align:middle line:90%
that anybody had ever seen.

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCMONEAGLE: It
was a submarine that

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:84%
was like two submarines
put together this way.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And nobody would ever
build a submarine

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.580 align:middle line:84%
this way because it
would be crushed if it

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:90%
went below a certain depth.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:90%
And it had 24 launch tubes.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And they were slanted, which
increased the threat because it

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:90%
could now launch on the move.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't have to
stop the launch, which

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.557 align:middle line:90%
made the old subs vulnerable.

00:15:21.557 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RADIN: And so he describes
it and says, well, it looks

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:90%
that there's tubes on the top.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:84%
There's turrets where
things can open up.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And it could shoot
rockets and so on.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And so this is reported back to
the National Security Council.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:90%
And they say, that's ridiculous.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing like that.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:90%
No one's ever reported it.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.570 align:middle line:90%
It's too big to be a submarine.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MCMONEAGLE: The senior analyst
there was the top Soviet analyst

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:90%
from the CIA at the time.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:10%
His name was Robert Gates.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:10%
And Robert Gates took one
look at the remote viewing

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:10%
and sent it back.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And there was a note on
top from Robert Gates.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And what it said was total
complete fantasy, RG.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.490 align:middle line:90%
And he rejected it.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.350 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, wait a minute.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.620 align:middle line:90%
And I put a note on top.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, fantasy will
be launched in 112 days, J.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RADIN: He then curious--

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Joe was curious about, well,
this is inside a building.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not even near any water.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So what are they
going to do with it?

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:90%
So he looks into the future--

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.405 align:middle line:84%
starts looking into the
future to find out, well,

00:16:27.405 --> 00:16:29.030 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen
with this thing?

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:84%
What he sees in the future is
they build a channel of water

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that leads out into
the ocean because they

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
want the submarine to
stay underneath that

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:84%
so the satellites can't see
it come out of the building.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.530 align:middle line:84%
It has to be deep enough
to go out to the water.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:90%
So that's what he sees.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:84%

at the end of the runway,
grass on the right,

an airport building on the left.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:90%
And I drew that as best I could.
