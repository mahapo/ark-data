Could the geometric
symmetry of snowflakes,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.490 align:middle line:84%
the intricate patterns of
our DNA, and the spiral

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:84%
shapes found in nature reveal
an embedded code of existence

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:84%
intricately woven
into the very fabric

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.590 align:middle line:90%
of the universe and ourselves?

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:84%
In recognizing this universal
language of geometry

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.550 align:middle line:84%
that connects the vast
cosmos to our core,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
how might the exploration
of these patterns

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:84%
not only deepen our
understanding of the universe,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
but also unite us,
allowing our differences

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
to enrich the tapestry
of human experience?

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Geometry, if
you break it down,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:10%
geo means Gaia or Mother
Earth, and metri means measure.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So actually geometry is
the fundamental foundation

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
of everything that
exists in the universe.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
From the stars, galaxies
to the cells in our body

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:90%
to our movements to vibrations.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:10%
Everything is expressed
in the geometry.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Geometry is everywhere
all throughout the universe,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.780 align:middle line:84%
from the microscopic up to
the cosmic and the Galactic.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:10%
There's a spiritual
meaning and archetypal

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.260 align:middle line:10%
meaning behind each geometry.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.960 align:middle line:10%
And that meaning is
where it becomes sacred,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:10%
because its source, its origin
is in the mind of the all,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:10%
and it has a purpose.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And that purpose to find a form
and that form has a function.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And that functionality is what
creates order in the universe

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
so that things can be
built. If we didn't

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
have these orders
and these structures,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
then the universe
wouldn't build anything.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:84%
It would just be a bunch of
scattered particles floating

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:90%
And there would be no order.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
There would be no forms that
were built beyond the particle

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So the sacred geometry
is like the scaffolding

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:84%
upon which the universe
and forms are built.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Visualizing the universe as
scaffolding through the lens

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:10%
of geometry introduces the
concept of the Platonic solids,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.660 align:middle line:10%
first explored in ancient Greece
by Plato who linked these forms

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.290 align:middle line:10%
to the classical elements
of earth, air, fire, water,

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:10%
and ether.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:84%
These associations over time
have enriched the solids

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.130 align:middle line:84%
with layers of philosophical
and spiritual significance,

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:84%
extending far beyond
their physical geometry,

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:84%
connecting the tangible
aspects of reality

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:84%
with the intangible realms
of thought and spirit,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:84%
inviting us to ponder
our interconnectedness

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:90%
within the cosmos.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at
the principal solids,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:10%
what are called the Platonic
solids, or in some cases,

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.830 align:middle line:10%
they are called the
solids of sacred geometry,

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:10%
what we see is a progression of
more complex patterns beginning

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:10%
with a tetrahedron, a
three-sided pyramid,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:10%
which is the most fundamental
building block of everything

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:10%
that we know in our universe.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes to
an octahedral, a cube,

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:84%
a dodecahedron,
and an icosahedron.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So we look at the
complexity of our world

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and of our bodies, of
the universe around us,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to apply the
fundamental principles

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors left for us,
including the Platonic solids

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and sacred geometry as the
nature of those solids.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:84%
What we see is that there are
additional principles that

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:84%
are in play that allow just
a few fundamental patterns

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.810 align:middle line:84%
to build out the
complexity of the world

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:90%
that we see around us.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Every three-dimensional
volumetric form is built upon

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:90%
just five, five platonic solids.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:84%
These become like
the building blocks.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And they combine and maybe
truncate one and then combine.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.272 align:middle line:84%
So I see sacred geometry as
like the language of creation.

00:04:47.272 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Then it's just a matter
of combining them

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:84%
together into
words and sentences

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.775 align:middle line:84%
to create everything
that we see around us.

00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Sacred geometry is considered
sacred because it is seen

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
as the blueprint of creation,
an underlying code that informs

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
the fabric of reality itself.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Embodying harmony,
proportion, and balance

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
where mathematics
meets mysticism,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and the material converges
with the spiritual.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We live those geometric
patterns in the womb

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:90%
of our mother.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I mean by that.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
If you look under a microscope
and you see a single human ovum

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
after it is fertilized,
the sperm and the egg come

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
together, they create the
ovum, that first cell when

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:84%
it divides into two cells,
it is two-dimensional.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:84%
If you were to draw a line
from the nucleus of one cell

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
to the other, it's
a straight line.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a two-dimensional
representation.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:84%
When each of those two cells
divide and create four cells,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:84%
those four cells
will always follow

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:84%
the same geometric pattern
in the womb of our mothers.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first
three-dimensional pattern

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
that we live as an embryo
in our mother's womb.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
If you take the nucleus from
each of those four cells

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and you connect them,
what you have is the first

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:90%
of the Platonic solids.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:90%
You have the tetrahedron.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.120 align:middle line:84%
When those four cells
then divide again,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.660 align:middle line:90%
we have eight cells.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And what we find is
not one tetrahedron,

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:84%
but two interlocking
tetrahedrons.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And what is sometimes
called a star tetrahedron

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:90%
in three dimensions.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:90%
And then we go on from there.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:84%
We literally live the
Platonic solids in sequence

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:84%
as we evolve and develop
in our mother's womb,

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
we live the sacred
geometry of the universe

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:84%
in the first moments and hours
of our lives in this world.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The Fibonacci sequence, a
series of numbers where each is

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.350 align:middle line:84%
the sum of the two preceding,
presents a universal pattern

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:84%
discovered in Indian mathematics
by 200 BC for its application

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:90%
in Sanskrit poetry.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
As the sequence
progresses, the ratio

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:84%
between consecutive
Fibonacci numbers

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:84%
approaches the golden ratio,
a mathematical constant

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:84%
known for its aesthetic
and harmonious properties.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.380 align:middle line:84%
This principle not only
dictates the 3D structure of DNA

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.350 align:middle line:84%
aligning with the
golden ratio, but also

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:84%
manifests in human biology
and the broader natural world,

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
showcasing the
interconnectedness

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
of all creation through
a mathematical lens.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting to note that
the diameter of the DNA is 21

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:90%
angstroms.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And if we count the turnings,
we will get to 34 angstroms.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
That's two factors of
the Fibonacci series.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And also if you look at,
there's different DNA.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:10%
There's DNA B, different DNA
A, different forms of DNA.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.760 align:middle line:10%
Each one of those actually
has a sacred geometry.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes the pentagon,
sometimes simply a spiral.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.770 align:middle line:10%
There's all different
forms of geometry

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:10%
when you look at it head on.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Spiral galaxies form a sacred
geometry based on the Fibonacci

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:90%
sequence.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And Fibonacci sequencing
is not just in the spiral,

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.710 align:middle line:90%
it's also within us.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
The length of this
part of our finger

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
to the next part of the
digit to the next part, these

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
are all five ratios from
the finger to the palm,

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.510 align:middle line:84%
from the palm to the forearm,
from the forearm to the bicep,

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:84%
from the arm to
the leg, and so on.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
We have this golden ratio,
this phi ratio all over us.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:51.100 align:middle line:84%
You see the same thing in shells
and in palm fronds or ferns

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.330 align:middle line:84%
in the rose, the sunflower,
you see it all over it.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be out there
in all the other planets

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:90%
and galaxies as well.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Nature displays a wealth
of geometric patterns.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Hexagons in snowflakes,
Fibonacci sequences

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.750 align:middle line:84%
in flower petals, fractal
designs in coastlines,

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and the spherical
shapes of planets.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
These patterns hint at universal
mathematical principles

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:84%
underlying all
growth and structure.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:84%
How might this understanding
of nature's inherent geometry

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:84%
lead us to an
interconnected understanding

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
that spans from the microscopic
world to the vast universe?

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:84%
- When we look at a
satellite image of the Earth

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and we see the rivers
and the tributaries

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:84%
that feed into those rivers
and the creeks and the streams

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that all feed into these from a
mountain range onto the plains,

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And you take that photograph
and you look at that

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and then you place that
next to an image of the root

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
system of a tree or
the branches of a tree,

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
or the bronchial system
of the human respiratory

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:84%
system of our lungs, or
our circulatory system.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know what
you're looking at,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.600 align:middle line:84%
you would be very hard
pressed to determine

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.300 align:middle line:84%
which one is biological, which
one is from the satellite,

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and which image is from
a tree or the roots,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.210 align:middle line:84%
because the fractal
pattern is playing out

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:84%
so beautifully in these
images, the same pattern,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:90%
different levels.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So another example
of this is when

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.480 align:middle line:84%
we look at a neuron
in the human brain

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and we look at a bolt
of lightning flashing

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:84%
through the sky, both of them
are electricity following

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
preferred pathways,
preferential pathways that

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:84%
allow that electricity
to express in the body.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:84%
It is through the cellular
nature of the neuron

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.950 align:middle line:84%
It is because of the
electrical nature

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
of the atmosphere that
allows that bolt of lightning

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.500 align:middle line:90%
to travel.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.910 align:middle line:10%
>> As an example, leaf, if
you look under the microscope

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:10%
and you see the intricate
patterns of the leaf,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.590 align:middle line:10%
and then you take our skin, the
human skin, it looks identical.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:84%
If you look into the
brain neural network,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
it looks identical to
the galaxies and neural

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.100 align:middle line:90%
networks in the stars as well.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Geometries impact reaches
beyond physical shape and form

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.860 align:middle line:84%
into the realms of
frequency and energy.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:84%
The flower of life
is a prime example

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:84%
with its multiple
overlapping circles.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:10%
This structure is the origin
of all geometric forms,

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.890 align:middle line:10%
including the Platonic solids.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.820 align:middle line:84%
It emanates energetic vibrations
that can be quantified.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:10%
Radionics devices harness
scalar wave technology

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:10%
to measure these
vibrations, offering insight

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:10%
into the profound impact
of geometric frequencies

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.498 align:middle line:10%
on reality.

00:11:59.498 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We actually measured
the vibrational frequency

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:90%
of the flower of life.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:10%
And if you were to imagine
that the scale that we apply

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.660 align:middle line:10%
in our human reality goes
from 0 to 1,000, 1,000

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:10%
being the highest frequency
possible for the human

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:10%
experience, flower
of life resonates

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:10%
at the frequency of 1,000.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:10%
And again, we're not speaking
about Hertz frequencies,

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:10%
because we're using a
different type of scale.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But this is the highest
vibrational frequency

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.580 align:middle line:84%
of a flower of life,
which is the sacred shape.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the Metatron cube is
another one of those that kind

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:90%
derives from the flower of life.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.100 align:middle line:84%
We just highlight out
certain spheres or circles

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:84%
that come out and shows more the
triangular kind of, as above so

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
below and multilayers
very much has

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
that sort of fractal sort of
nature to it in many ways.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And I see that the flower of
life and Metatron cube they

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
almost anchor to
different energies

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:90%
from the Galactic source.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.820 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Understanding how geometry
permeates the universe

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
connects our inner world
with the outer reality.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.380 align:middle line:84%
It provides a structure
for grasping the cosmos

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:84%
resonating with our
instinct to find patterns

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and meaning throughout
the vastness of existence.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The meanings that we give
to sacred geometries are not

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:84%
really-- they're
not our meanings.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
They're the meaning
that was originally

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:84%
given to them by some
intelligence source that

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.110 align:middle line:84%
created the universe,
and we rediscover them.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the sphere
geometrically speaking,

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:84%
mathematically speaking
is the optimal form

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:47.170 align:middle line:90%
for packing energy into matter.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the sphere from a
sacred geometric perspective

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.730 align:middle line:84%
actually represents the
physical density level itself.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:84%
If you look out into space,
every planet, every star,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
every moon is in the
shape of a sphere.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the cube is very
stable, but it's also

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:90%
represents our mind.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Our mind likes to put things
in boxes, so to speak.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a construct that
we then operate and perceive

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid often
represents the spirit.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the Trinity.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the mother, father,
child kind of archetype,

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.400 align:middle line:84%
or the oneness that then
divides into the feminine

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.450 align:middle line:90%
and the masculine.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:84%
The triangle always represents
the spiritual realm,

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:84%
especially when it's
upright, it's ascending.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the downward triangle
is more about the descending.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It's as above and
the so below, which

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.920 align:middle line:84%
you have in the Star
of David, for example.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.065 align:middle line:84%
So every geometry has
its own unique meaning.

00:14:47.065 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Recent studies in the
field of regenerative medicine

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and tissue engineering show how
geometry influences stem cell

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:84%
differentiation, opening new
avenues for innovative healing

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:84%
strategies and
disease treatments.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:10%
>> The fascinating thing that's
happening and emerging over

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:19.150 align:middle line:10%
the last several years is the
study of how geometry shapes

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:10%
the outcome of our
health and well being.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:10%
How it can be applied.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:10%
And let me give you
a great example.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
There was a great study
that was published

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:33.140 align:middle line:84%
looking into exposing stem
cells to different geometrical

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a study that was done
in University of Chicago.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And here are the
fascinating facts.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Every single cell in our
body is absolutely identical.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So the question becomes,
what is the guiding

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
force behind our stem cells
or behind our very existence

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
that directs and orchestrates
this beautiful symphony

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
of cells becoming bones, fat
cells, our kidney cells, heart

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:90%
cells.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It looked into exposing stem
cells to two different types

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:90%
of shapes.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:10%
The first group was exposed to
shapes that were like stars.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And it directed the stem cells
to become strong cytokines.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:10%
It means that the
cells became bones.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Now another example
was stem cells

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:84%
exposed to flower pattern,
geometrical pattern.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And the result was absolutely
drastically different.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Those cells became
loose cytokines

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of flower shape.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:10%
And they translated
into becoming fat cells.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:10%
So this is a great
example that geometry

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:10%
is the universal guiding
force that guides information

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:10%
into materializing of what
it is that we want to see.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Based upon this
understanding,

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:10%
scientists are exploring the use
of geometry as a novel strategy

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:10%
to combat diseases
caused by viruses.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What was done is they've
created an icosahedron,

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:84%
which is a geometric
DNA nano cage.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:10%
So they were able to entrap
this particular virus

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:10%
and deactivate it.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:10%
So this as a result is such
a significant and profound

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.680 align:middle line:10%
information for all of
us to know because now we

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.420 align:middle line:10%
understand that science is truly
looking into how geometry can

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:10%
play a significant role
in many of the viruses

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:10%
that are unfolding
in our daily lives,

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.430 align:middle line:10%
and how it can be expressed
in our health and well being.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Ancient traditions,
particularly in Egypt

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:10%
and India, have long recognized
geometry as a foundational

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.580 align:middle line:10%
element of their spiritual
and cosmological beliefs.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
These cultures saw geometric
principles as not just

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
mathematical constructs, but
as aligning celestial harmony

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:84%
with earthly existence through
architecture, art, and healing

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.990 align:middle line:90%
practices.

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:10%
>> The patterns of the universe
is a very important aspect

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:29.560 align:middle line:10%
of my work with Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi who has looked at Veda

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.730 align:middle line:10%
and Vedic literature as the
structure of what he calls

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:10%
the constitution
of the universe.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Structure means-- geometry means
relationship means mathematics

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And he has shown how the
syllables of the Veda

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:84%
actually manifest in a
very sequential fashion,

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:84%
creating an orderly
structure of the way nature

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.460 align:middle line:90%
manifests itself.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:10%
So he asked me as
a neuroscientist

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:10%
and studying human
physiology and anatomy

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:10%
to look at the structure
of this Vedic sound that

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.360 align:middle line:10%
have a structure,
which means a geometry,

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:10%
and the structure
of the human body.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.590 align:middle line:10%
And what I have found
after years of research

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:10%
is that there is an
exact correspondence

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.240 align:middle line:10%
between the
structure of the Veda

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.880 align:middle line:10%
and the structure
of the human body.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is an
indication that there

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:41.160 align:middle line:84%
is a basic geometry, which
when assembled together

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
in one being, which
is a human being,

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:84%
allows us to experience the full
value of the laws of nature.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle line:84%
The full value of the
constitution of the universe.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's why as human
beings, we can get enlightened.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.560 align:middle line:84%
We can experience
totality and wholeness.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.940 align:middle line:84%
It's because the dynamics
of natural law, the dynamics

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:84%
of the constitution
of the universe

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:84%
are physically
present within us.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
important correlation

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.860 align:middle line:84%
between consciousness,
because the dynamics

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:84%
of the Vedic literature are just
an expression of a cognition

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
of the reverberations,
the vibrations, the sounds

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:84%
of the Veda that
have a structure,

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.780 align:middle line:84%
but we find them
as the blueprint

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:90%
of our own human physiology.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Sacred geometry serves as
a bridge between our physical

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.560 align:middle line:10%
existence and the unseen
dimensions of energy

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.030 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:84%
This universal language is
embodied in the chakra system

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:84%
from ancient India, which
features unique geometric

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
patterns and frequencies
associated with each energy

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:84%
center, playing a
pivotal role in enhancing

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.530 align:middle line:84%
spiritual growth,
physical health,

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.420 align:middle line:90%
and emotional well-being.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:10%
>> The fascinating aspect about
sacred geometrical symbols is

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:10%
that they connect us directly
through different chakras

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.530 align:middle line:10%
to our physicality.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:14.040 align:middle line:84%
As a first example, we
will use tetrahedron.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:10%
Tetrahedron, it is linked to
your solar plexus, your power

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:10%
center.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
any kind of imbalances

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.630 align:middle line:84%
that are linked to
your solar plexus that

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:84%
would be your digestion,
on another level,

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:90%
it could be your power center.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
This is a very powerful
symbol to begin

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.050 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate in your life if
you're having digestive issues.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.110 align:middle line:10%
Example number 2
would be hexahedron.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Hexahedron is a great
example of everything related

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.260 align:middle line:84%
to our physical body,
our structure, our bones,

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.980 align:middle line:84%
connection to our very
existence on Earth.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So this will be a wonderful
sacred geometrical shape

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:84%
to begin to incorporate
in your life

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:84%
if you're having any
kind of aches and pains.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:10%
A third example
will be octahedral.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It stands for the
element of air,

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.300 align:middle line:90%
and it's like two pyramids.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So one from the top and
one from the bottom.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's linked to your heart
center, your heart chakra.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.840 align:middle line:84%
It's all about connection
and understanding

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.600 align:middle line:90%
your inner and outer world.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.140 align:middle line:10%
The next example
will be icosahedron.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And icosahedron is
linked to your emotions.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going through
stressful turbulent times

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.545 align:middle line:84%
in your life, this
is a water element.

00:22:42.545 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:84%
It's also linked to
your water element.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's linked
to your emotions.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:10%
The next one is
the dodecahedron.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And that one is linked to
the upper three chakras.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, what are
some of the imbalances

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:90%
that can happen there?

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:84%
But one of the upper chakras
will be your throat chakra.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.850 align:middle line:10%
And it's fascinating that
in the last 10 years,

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:08.350 align:middle line:10%
we almost have an epidemic of
thyroid imbalances in women

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.650 align:middle line:10%
across the globe.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.880 align:middle line:10%
So this will be a wonderful
sacred geometrical pattern

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:10%
to begin to incorporate and
infuse your thyroid, which is

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.660 align:middle line:10%
all about speaking your truth.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.610 align:middle line:10%
Your universal truth.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And again, the dodecahedron
is linked to everything

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.560 align:middle line:90%
up in the heavens.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:84%
It is related to your
higher consciousness.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So what I recommend
doing is visualizing

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful hexahedron coming
into you and wherever you feel

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:42.190 align:middle line:90%
is needed.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:10%
So for most people,
if it's a hexahedron,

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:10%
it's needed in your
skeleton structure,

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.690 align:middle line:10%
also in your root chakra.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:10%
So you can visualize that
particular sacred geometrical

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.920 align:middle line:10%
pattern going in
and being infused.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And helping secure also
with your intention

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
feeling that safety and
security and stability.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
It's providing literally
the four walls.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.350 align:middle line:10%
It's a house that you reside in.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.240 align:middle line:84%
This is your physical
house as well.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Another example would be
to meditate on the symbol

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:84%
with your intention
of whatever it

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.410 align:middle line:84%
is you choose to
support as healing

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:84%
process in your physical
and emotional body.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So you can visualize
that particular symbol

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.550 align:middle line:84%
going into your third
eye and radiating it

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:35.980 align:middle line:84%
wherever it's needed in your
physical system as well.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Universal geometry shapes
not only the foundation

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.750 align:middle line:84%
of our cosmos, but also
infuses our own world and inner

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.960 align:middle line:84%
universe with sacred
patterns and purpose.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But what is its impact
on our daily lives?

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And does this ancient wisdom
enrich our personal journeys?

00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>> There is perfect orderliness
in the unmanifest field

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
of being, and that
has perfect geometry.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:09.760 align:middle line:10%
There can be different dynamics
that might show geometries

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.550 align:middle line:10%
that are not as perfect.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we have
suffering and problems.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And if we can realign
the manifest geometry

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.770 align:middle line:84%
with the unmanifest
geometry, then we

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:90%
have perfection in life.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.560 align:middle line:84%
The best way to do
that is to go back

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.660 align:middle line:84%
to the perfect
geometry, which is

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:84%
available in the
transcendental field

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:84%
of the unmanifest pure
consciousness, which

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:46.910 align:middle line:84%
is our own inner self, which
is our true ultimate self.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And in that is the
constitution of the universe,

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.000 align:middle line:90%
the geometry of the universe.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.470 align:middle line:10%
>> When we come to understand
that the core essence

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:10%
of our three-dimensional world
or our multidimensional world,

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.020 align:middle line:10%
the core essence of what builds
up and creates that order is

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:10%
the sacred geometry.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And when we understand
the sacred part

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.210 align:middle line:84%
to the geometry, the meaning,
the purpose behind it

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:84%
all, we can see that
everything is sacred.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Everything is infused with
that signature of the sacred.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And it allows us to
see the world around us

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:32.070 align:middle line:84%
as meaningful and as
beautiful and as purposeful.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
sacred geometry

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:84%
becomes a lens
through which we can

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:39.910 align:middle line:84%
see a much more alive and
purposeful world around us.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to gain
a personal connection with it.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.910 align:middle line:10%
>> At the most fundamental
level of the non-randomness,

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.190 align:middle line:10%
whether it's the universe
or it's our bodies,

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:10%
what we see are patterns.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Patterns of energy.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And those patterns of
energy will always form

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:04.250 align:middle line:84%
in predetermined arrangements
that we call geometry.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And that geometry appears
to be so universal

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
that it is the governing
principle for everything

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.870 align:middle line:84%
from the birth of a star
to the birth of a human

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:90%
in our mother's womb.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Truly the geometry is
the universal language

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.210 align:middle line:84%
that describes the
principles of the world

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.740 align:middle line:90%
that we live in today.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.720 align:middle line:84%
The better we
understand our world

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and the better we understand
ourselves, the less we

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
fear the changes that
we see in the world,

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.850 align:middle line:84%
the less we fear one another,
and perhaps most of all,

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:84%
most importantly, the less
we fear our own power.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is the
value of understanding

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:84%
the deep relationships
that we have

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:84%
with the geometry of our
world through the eyes

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.600 align:middle line:84%
of our ancestors, as well as
through the eyes of the best

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.720 align:middle line:90%
science of the modern world.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Amidst the intricate
tapestry of existence,

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:10%
universal and sacred geometry
stand as timeless guides,

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:05.720 align:middle line:10%
illuminating the path forward
and offering keys to unlock

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.710 align:middle line:10%
our potential and foster
