And I look at it and I say,
bend, melt, bend, melt.

And look, the metal is becoming
almost like plastic plasticine.

No heat is produced.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:90%
I say bend, melt, bend.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:90%
And look.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.824 align:middle line:84%

that, and the spoon broke.

abilities are not

rare anomalies, but clues to an
untapped power within us all?

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Could feats like bending
a spoon with the mind

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.778 align:middle line:84%
reveal the true potential
of human consciousness?

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:10%
>> So when we think about what
the best science of the modern

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:10%
world is now telling us about
our relationship to the field

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:10%
of energy that underlies all
existence makes perfect sense

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:10%
that we would have the ability
to interact with that field.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:90%
We always have.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.120 align:middle line:10%
We may not have
known the science,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.050 align:middle line:10%
but we certainly
knew the processes

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:10%
that will facilitate these.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:10%
And we call these
psychic abilities.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychic abilities are when
you can access information that

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:10%
is outside the five
physical senses.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:84%
What I tend to call
it is universal Wi-Fi.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.900 align:middle line:10%
Just like our cell
phones are connected

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:10%
to Wi-Fi or our computers
and the internet,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:10%
it's like we're living in a
big internet, if you will,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:10%
where we can get
access to information.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychic abilities encompass
a wide range of phenomena.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most common are
psychokinesis and telekinesis,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:84%
the abilities to
influence or move

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:90%
physical objects with the mind.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:10%
Telepathy, the transfer
of thoughts or emotions

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:10%
between individuals.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Precognition, the
perception of future events.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:10%
Presentiment, the sensing of
something before it happens.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And deep intuition, a profound
knowing that guides decisions

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.620 align:middle line:90%
without conscious reasoning.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Together, these
abilities reflect

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:84%
our biological connection
to an energetic field,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.550 align:middle line:84%
with the mind and body
acting as antennas

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
to access this universal
source of information.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we talk
about psychic abilities,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
we are exploring our biological
relationship in an energetic

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
We are the technology
we've been waiting for.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:90%
We are the transducers.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
We are the soft
technology that is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with
information that lives

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:90%
in the field, our divinity.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
This is where our imagination,
our creativity, our innovation,

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
our love, our healing, all
originate in that field.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And many psychic
experiences are actually

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
rooted in what we
call deep intuition.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's hunches,
gut feelings.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
If I'm standing in
front of someone

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:90%
that I don't they're dangerous.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I can't perceive the
danger with my five senses,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
but the hair on
the back of my neck

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.600 align:middle line:84%
is standing up, that
would be an intuitive hit.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Something's not right here.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Intuition is just on a
spectrum of various psychic

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:90%
abilities.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:10%
And it might be the
most common, what people

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:10%
might call gut hunches,
or I just know it,

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:10%
or I just feel that it's true.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
It is a type of
psychic ability that

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:84%
shows up in a particular
way, whether it's

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
through the body, known
cognitively, or known

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.380 align:middle line:90%
through emotions.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychic abilities are so
prevalent that remote viewing

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:10%
science tells us that only
10% of people don't have them.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And those are the people
who doubt and deny them.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So what they're saying, and
what I've seen personally,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:84%
is that literally
everyone has them.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> When psychic experiences are
far more common than many might

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
assume, it challenges us to
rethink what we know about human

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:84%
potential, suggesting these
phenomena are deeply woven

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:90%
into the human experience.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:10%
This universality raises
intriguing questions

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:10%
about how these
abilities manifest

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:10%
and what they might reveal
about our connection

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:10%
to the unseen forces of reality.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been studying psychic
phenomena in the laboratory

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:90%
for about 40 years.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:10%
Virtually, any kind
of psychic effect

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:10%
that is amenable to
being studied in the lab,

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:10%
I've done that.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Of the different kinds of
studies that I've done,

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
the one that I think has
produced the strongest effect is

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:90%
something I call presentiment.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Presentiment refers to
the phenomenon where the body

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%
unconsciously responds to a
future event before it occurs,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
suggesting a form
of pre-awareness.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.070 align:middle line:84%
It is not a
conscious prediction,

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
but a subtle
physiological reaction,

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:84%
such as changes in heart rate,
skin conductance, or brain

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And it works like this.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:84%
If you connect a measurement
device on somebody's finger,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
you can measure the
conductivity of their skin.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is when somebody

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
is startled, shocked or scared
in some way, they will tense up.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And their sweat glands will
start to produce more sweat.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And the conductivity of their
skin increases, and this all

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:90%
happens in under 1 second.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So what they'll do is they'll
have the human subject sit

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.800 align:middle line:90%
i front of the computer.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:10%
The computer will
be flashing images

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:10%
at random, totally unpredictable
which images show up.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:10%
And what happens is a
few seconds before being

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:10%
shown something scary, the skin
conductivity will increase.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.480 align:middle line:10%
What you find is there's
actually a very significant

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:10%
subconscious involuntary
reaction just prior

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:10%
to being shown the scary image.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be a genuine
psi, pre-cognitive effect.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The conclusion from the
presentiment experiments is

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:84%
a confirmation of what we see
in virtually any kind of psychic

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.060 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Part of our unconscious mind
is scanning our past, present,

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:90%
and future all the time.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.690 align:middle line:90%
It's always operating.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.020 align:middle line:10%
The presentiment experiment
says, in particular,

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.950 align:middle line:10%
that if we can train ourselves
to have better interoception,

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:10%
that's the technical
term for paying attention

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:10%
to your gut and your
heart and your skin

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:10%
and so on, some people will
feel this as getting a chill.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.700 align:middle line:90%
They get goosebumps.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Other people will feel it
in many different ways.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you're driving
along somewhere

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and you get this bad
feeling, if you're

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.533 align:middle line:84%
really good at interoception,
you will feel it.

00:07:19.533 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel something
in your gut.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel something
in your heart.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Your body is trying to tell
you that in 5 seconds from now,

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:90%
there's going to be an uh-oh.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the message
that we get from this

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.160 align:middle line:90%
and many other experiments.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
That level of awareness
is always there.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>> It turns out that it's
not just humans either.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:84%
There was a study
by Alvarez, who

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:84%
showed that finches, when
being shown images at random,

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
would start to
become agitated prior

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
to being shown an
image of a snake, which

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:90%
is their natural predator.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So this ability seems
to be generalized across

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
not just humans, but
animals and insects, perhaps

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:90%
even life itself.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The ability to sense events
beyond immediate perception

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
challenges our understanding
of time and causality.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Could the key to these
extraordinary connections

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.790 align:middle line:90%
lie within our very biology?

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>> In the late 2000s, scientists
made a series of discoveries

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:26.037 align:middle line:84%
that give deep insight into why
psychic abilities, number one,

00:08:26.037 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:84%
why they're possible,
number two, why they happen,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
number three, how we can maybe
develop them to even deeper

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.049 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:84%
One of those discoveries
was that DNA literally

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.760 align:middle line:90%
function as antennae.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:10%
Not just any kind of antenna,
but what are called fractal

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.350 align:middle line:10%
antennae.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is that they're

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:84%
receiving multiple
bandwidths of information

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:84%
across a broad spectrum all at
the same time simultaneously.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
DNA, from an
engineering perspective,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.210 align:middle line:90%
is a fractal antenna.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's where this comes
into the psychic abilities.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Another series of studies
in the biological world

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:12.020 align:middle line:84%
showed that when a woman
conceives a life in her womb,

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:18.320 align:middle line:84%
the DNA of the baby circulates
in the mother's blood and lodges

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:90%
in organs in her body.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And her DNA is circulating in
her baby's blood and lodges

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:84%
in specific organs
in her baby's body.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:84%
There's resonant
information being

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.360 align:middle line:84%
transmitted between the living
offspring and their mother.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's no surprise that when
the offspring is in trouble,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a five-year-old
baby falling off of a slide

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:84%
or a swing in the backyard, or
a 23-year old son hit by an IED

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.595 align:middle line:84%
in Afghanistan, that the
mother is going to know,

00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
to sense that
something is wrong.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And this helps us understand
what psychic abilities are all

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.990 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:84%
The information is being
transferred between two living

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It has to have a
medium to flow through.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:90%
It's flowing through the field.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.120 align:middle line:90%
We all have this all the time.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.900 align:middle line:84%
The question is, do
we trust ourselves

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:84%
enough to accept the information
that we're receiving?

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Or do we discount
that information.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.670 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a fascinating
phenomenon called telesomatic

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:10%
phenomenon, where pairs
of people actually feel

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.650 align:middle line:10%
the physical sensations
of the other pair.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Take twins, for example.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:40.870 align:middle line:84%
There have been numerous
anecdotes where one twin has

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:84%
been injured in some way
or in a car accident,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and the other twin
knows it immediately,

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:90%
exactly when it happens.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:84%
There have been anecdotes of one
twin or one bonded pair going

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:84%
into labor and the
other person being like,

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, they're in labor because
I'm feeling labor pains.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:10%
There are numerous,
numerous anecdotes.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:10%
And we're collecting
all of these

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.900 align:middle line:10%
so that we can be able to
do formal analysis of them

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:15.730 align:middle line:10%
and see what their
commonalities are.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2017, Dr. Dean Radin
conducted a groundbreaking study

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.140 align:middle line:84%
exploring the influence of
focused mental intention

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.410 align:middle line:84%
on quantum systems Among the
participants was Brandy Gilmore,

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:84%
whose experience in this
experiment revealed fascinating

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.240 align:middle line:84%
insights into the potential
interplay between consciousness

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.190 align:middle line:90%
and the physical world.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, I was
locked in this room.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And in another room
there was a photon beam

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:84%
with photon splitters and then
a photon counter at the end.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And basically what happened
is in this vault closet,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
if you will, this little voice
would come on and say, go.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
what you do is want

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.410 align:middle line:84%
to use your mind
to then influence

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:90%
the photons in the photon beam.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.795 align:middle line:90%
And so then it would stop.

00:11:59.795 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And then it would go.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:90%
And then it would stop.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:10%
And basically, you could tell
when you're using your mind

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:10%
and when you're not
using your mind,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:10%
you can see the fluctuations
in the photon beam and photon

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:10%
counter and all of that.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Things are correlated, but
we don't know exactly why.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And that is the case
in entanglement.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.658 align:middle line:84%
Things are connected
through space and time.

00:12:17.658 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, how does that work?

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't exactly know.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.110 align:middle line:84%
We have equations that
will describe how it works.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.170 align:middle line:84%
But at a real
fundamental level, we

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:90%
don't know how that's possible.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Emerging research into
psi and genetics suggests

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:84%
a fascinating link, pointing to
a specific region of the genome

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that may hold clues to the
innate psychic potential present

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:90%
in all of us.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> We completed a study looking
at the genetics of psychic

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
ability, and actually looked
at high-functioning psychics,

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
compared to age, gender,
and race-matched controls.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:10%
And we found a fascinating
preliminary finding

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.660 align:middle line:10%
on chromosome 7 on
a non-coding region

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:09.680 align:middle line:10%
that's called TNRC7 And what
was fascinating about this part

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:10%
of the genome was
that the psychics had

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:10%
the original or wild type form,
and the controls had a mutation,

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:10%
meaning that it
mutated towards not

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.220 align:middle line:10%
expressing the psychic ability.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.510 align:middle line:90%
This was so intriguing to us.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.950 align:middle line:84%
We went and looked
at genomic databases

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:84%
that had thousands and
thousands of people

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and found that this wild
type original version was

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:84%
present in over
90% of the people

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:49.220 align:middle line:84%
in that data set, which really
supports this idea that we all

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
have this innate
ability to be psychic.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> This discovery raises
an intriguing question.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:84%
What could have led
to a mutation away

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:90%
from psychic ability?

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So we did an analysis,
comparing the genomes in more

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:84%
technologically-advanced
countries versus less advanced.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And we found increased mutations
in the technologically-advanced

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
countries that was significant,
which supported our hypothesis.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>> This finding raises
compelling questions about how

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.290 align:middle line:84%
environmental and technological
factors might influence

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:84%
the expression of
psychic abilities.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, when individuals
experience a psychic insight,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:84%
measurable changes
occur in the brain,

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.790 align:middle line:84%
offering a glimpse into the
interplay between mind, biology,

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:90%
and intuition.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The most interesting and
wonderful thing about a psychic

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.360 align:middle line:84%
insight is that it
powers up the brain.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.320 align:middle line:84%
You will see an increase
in the amplitude

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:90%
of the brainwave categories.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:58.070 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes you can
see somebody's gamma,

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.290 align:middle line:10%
and then the gamma
goes up like this.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:10%
And it can double, triple,
quadruple in amplitude

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:10%
as the brain lights
up and becomes

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:10%
more lucid, awake and aware,
which creates a coherence.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
That moment of insight is
just an absolute joy to watch.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's definitely
quantifiable.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:10%
You can look at the data
and see a huge change

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:10%
in the brainwave pattern.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>> One technology designed to
explore and optimize brainwave

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:84%
activity is the mind mirror,
a sophisticated neurofeedback

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:90%
device.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.190 align:middle line:10%
It monitors brainwave
frequencies,

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:40.200 align:middle line:10%
including delta
waves, 0.5 to 4 Hertz,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle line:10%
dominant during deep restorative
sleep, theta waves, 4 to 8

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:10%
Hertz, linked to
creativity, intuition,

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:10%
and deep relaxation,
alpha waves, 8 to 14,

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:10%
associated with calm focus and
meditative states, beta waves 14

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:10%
to 30 Hertz, connected to
alertness, concentration,

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:10%
and problem solving, and
gamma waves, 30 to 100

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:10%
Hertz, which are linked to
peak cognitive performance

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:10%
and heightened perception.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
The mind mirror provides
valuable insights

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.580 align:middle line:84%
into the relationship between
consciousness and brain

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>> On the mind mirror, we
are looking at two different

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:90%
measurements.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So the frequency is the
speed of the thought.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And the amplitude is the
power of the thought.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:10%
So by looking at
the two together,

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.940 align:middle line:10%
the speed of the
electrical signal,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:10%
the power of the electrical
signal, what we're actually

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:10%
looking at is the
activities of consciousness.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:10%
If someone, for example, gets
really busy with their beta

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:10%
and it splays outward into
high frequency stress, anxiety,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle line:10%
and panic, then we see
the alpha bridge collapse.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.210 align:middle line:10%
Or you can have a huge
amplitude decrease in healers

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:10%
like psychics and healers.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.280 align:middle line:10%
They'll have a massive, massive
delta down at the bottom.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:10%
So it's really less about what
amplitude they start with,

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:10%
as it is the changes that
occur during the session

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:10%
as they access energy
and information.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Research further suggests
that focused mental intention

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:84%
can create measurable changes
in a recipient's body,

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:84%
influencing brainwaves,
heart activity,

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:90%
and other physiological markers.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:84%
These experiments aim to uncover
whether a connection exists

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:90%
that transcends physical space.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:10%
>> I think some of the most
compelling physiological

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.030 align:middle line:10%
evidence around psychic
abilities is with the Distant

Mental Intention of
Living Systems protocol,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.160 align:middle line:10%
which essentially took pairs
of people and separated them

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.900 align:middle line:10%
into completely different
parts of the building,

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:10%
and then hooked both of them
up to physiological recording

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:10%
devices.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was EEG,
looking at brainwaves,

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:84%
or EKG heart waves,
what was happening

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:84%
on the skin or other
parts of the body,

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and then they would have one
person direct their intention

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:90%
towards the other.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:10%
And during those periods
of directed intention,

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:10%
the receiver's
physiology would change,

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:10%
compared to times when
the other person wasn't

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.400 align:middle line:10%
directing their intention.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So these people are
separated completely.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the receiver's body
is changing when someone else

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.480 align:middle line:90%
is directing intention to it.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The measurable physiological
changes seen in studies

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.710 align:middle line:84%
of distant intention point
to an intriguing question.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:01.030 align:middle line:84%
How are such connections
possible across physical space?

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:10%
Some researchers
suggest that the answer

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.010 align:middle line:10%
lies in quantum
principles, where

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.860 align:middle line:10%
the concept of
non-locality challenges

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:10%
our traditional understanding
of time and space.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me share a little bit
about what entanglement means.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:84%
There was an experiment that was
done back in the 1990s called

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:25.280 align:middle line:84%
the Twin Photon Experiment,
where Swiss engineers,

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.057 align:middle line:84%
they took one photon,
a particle of light,

00:19:28.057 --> 00:19:29.140 align:middle line:90%
and they broke it in half.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So they were two
identical photons

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.060 align:middle line:90%
came from the same original.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And they put them into a special
device with fiber optic cables.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.153 align:middle line:84%
And one device shot
one photon seven miles

00:19:41.153 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:84%
in one direction
and the other one

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:84%
seven miles in the
other direction.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Now they're 14 miles apart,
and the experiment begins.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything they did to
one of these photons,

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.680 align:middle line:84%
the other one acted like
it had the same experience.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And the question was,
how did that happen?

00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:10%
How did this photon
tell this photon

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:10%
that it had just been
forced a certain direction

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.430 align:middle line:10%
or have a certain polarity?

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:10%
The answer is it
didn't have to tell.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Because even though they
were physically separated

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:84%
energetically, they were
still connected because they

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.420 align:middle line:84%
had been part of
the same photon.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:84%
This goes back to the
very beginning of what

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:90%
physicists call the Big Bang.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Fractions of a second, all
of the matter in the universe

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:84%
was collapsed into a space
about the size of a green pea.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Everything was connected.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:40.510 align:middle line:84%
As the expansion continued
and the physical matter

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:84%
separated energetically,
it remained connected.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:49.250 align:middle line:84%
We are products of
that physical matter.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:54.640 align:middle line:84%
We are atoms that were formed
in that original primal release

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:84%
This is why we are
connected with one another.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:90%
This is why ESP works.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Because energetically, we
are still part of that field.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:90%

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> In the physicalist paradigm,
our consciousness is anchored

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.430 align:middle line:90%
in our physical brain.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our neurons
create our consciousness.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.440 align:middle line:84%
In a non-physicalist
paradigm, our consciousness

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:84%
is not an artifact
of the brain and goes

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:middle line:90%
beyond our physical brain.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It's, in fact,
non-local, that expands

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:34.620 align:middle line:84%
beyond our conventional
notions of time and space.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:90%
It transcends them.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea that consciousness
transcends the physical brain

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:84%
challenges our
understanding of reality.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Could the bending of a
spoon, known as telekinesis,

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:84%
reveal an extraordinary
connection

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:90%
between mind and matter?

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:10%
Some believe quantum
principles, like non-locality

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.050 align:middle line:10%
and the observer
effect, may hold the key

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:10%
to unlocking this mystery.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:10%
>> So when I manipulate a
spoon, when I stroke it gently,

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:10%
when I command it to bend or
break or melt or grow or move,

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:10%
I produce an energy wave.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe it comes
out from my finger.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:10%
I believe it comes
out from my mind,

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:25.900 align:middle line:10%
and it penetrates the molecular
structure of the metal.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:32.530 align:middle line:10%
Maybe I'm deriving,
or I'm extracting

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:10%
some kind of a power, some
kind of a universal energy

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:10%
from outside me.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.150 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it has nothing
to do with my mind.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:10%
Maybe there is some kind of
an intelligence above me,

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:10%
a super force, a thinking entity
that does this thing through me.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Uri Geller, or anyone else
who's good at bending spoons,

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.390 align:middle line:10%
what they're having to do
is dissolve their awareness

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:10%
of themselves as a separate
entity having a specific action

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.140 align:middle line:10%
on a separate object.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:22.400 align:middle line:84%
They are saying, this
is all one field.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.590 align:middle line:90%
We are nothing but energy.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to vibrate at
the energy of the spoon,

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:35.150 align:middle line:84%
or the spoon is going to vibrate
at my energetic frequency.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.940 align:middle line:90%
But there's a union.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a union
between the person

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.170 align:middle line:84%
in the field, the
field in the spoon,

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.930 align:middle line:84%
to know that it's only one
field, only one energy.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So in the movie The Matrix,
they would probably say,

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:84%
you have to realize
that there is no spoon.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And there is some
reality to that.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:10%
Because ultimately, the world
that we perceive, again,

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.010 align:middle line:10%
through the limitations
of the body,

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:10%
makes us believe that
there is a solid form.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So what a psychic
would have to do

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.650 align:middle line:84%
is actually overcome
this limitation

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and realize that there
is a living nature

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:84%
inside of the spoon that
determines its appearance,

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and the actual setup
of its particles.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.570 align:middle line:10%
>> When I do spoon bending, I
like to describe the science

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:25.590 align:middle line:10%
behind it.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:29.280 align:middle line:84%
So you first, what I like
to say is you heat it up.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:84%
You can sense the
particles inside of it.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:37.120 align:middle line:10%
And heating up particles,
heating up electrons and stuff,

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:10%
so it'll get
everything activated.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But then there's the
spiritual side of it.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.840 align:middle line:90%
You're able to connect to that.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:84%
You're able to feel when this
material was still liquid,

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:84%
when it was molten,
and when it was being

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:90%
poured into what it is now.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:84%
You could still go back in
time and talk to that material.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:07.595 align:middle line:84%
You could go back in time to
ask, how do you want to be bent.

00:25:07.595 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:10%
>> So in the brainwave
pattern of a spoon bender,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.740 align:middle line:10%
you will initially see an
advanced brainwave pattern.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.870 align:middle line:10%
And then when they
start to bend the spoon,

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:10%
it seems to me so far, that
one of two things happens.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.670 align:middle line:10%
Either they extend
their delta way,

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:10%
way out into
hyper-micro voltages,

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:38.690 align:middle line:10%
because their unconscious mind
is moving out into the field

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:43.610 align:middle line:10%
to connect with
the quantum field,

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:10%
and they're getting
the spoon bending power

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:10%
from making that connection.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.990 align:middle line:10%
Or conversely, at the
other end of the spectrum,

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.070 align:middle line:10%
they are increasing the
power of their gamma,

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.030 align:middle line:10%
powering up the brain.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:84%
The brain is running
faster, much faster

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:03.290 align:middle line:84%
at the moment they
bend the spoon.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have an enormous
amount of infinite energy.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And now you have
non-localized consciousness

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.870 align:middle line:84%
that is interplaying
with each other.

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:17.550 align:middle line:84%
That means consciousness is
determining every type of form,

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.190 align:middle line:90%
every type of functionality.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And accessing that and
training how to access that

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:84%
gives you a limitless amount
of colors for your own reality

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:90%
to create with.

evidence, in my mind,

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.880 align:middle line:10%
that consciousness
is all there is,

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:10%

raising questions about
what shapes such abilities.

psychically than others?

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:10%
And I think about it like
someone who plays the piano.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.720 align:middle line:10%
We can all play the piano.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us can
develop psychic abilities.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But some of us
are going to do it

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.990 align:middle line:84%
at a different
level than others.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Some are going to be
on a concert stage,

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
some are going to be
playing chopsticks.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And that'll be the
height of their ability.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:10%
>> So one of the reasons why we
don't experience these things

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:33.460 align:middle line:10%
more often is because of a
societal stigma or a taboo that

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.530 align:middle line:10%
prevents people from openly
talking about their experiences.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:10%
That's a pity.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:10%
Because it also restricts
what we can learn about them.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.880 align:middle line:10%
So science has been
studying these kinds

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:10%
of effects for about 140
years in laboratory studies.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.570 align:middle line:10%
We know now with very high
confidence that some of what

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.850 align:middle line:10%
I would say,
elementary experiences

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.230 align:middle line:10%
that people have are real.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:58.210 align:middle line:10%
It's like shockingly clear,
that the moment you step outside

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:10%
of a limited set of
assumptions, all those things

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:10%
that you used to call crazy
or delusional or whatever,

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:08.540 align:middle line:10%
they're fraudulent, no,
they not only can be real,

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.930 align:middle line:10%
they must be real
at these larger

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:12.300 align:middle line:10%
ways of thinking about reality.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.220 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a spiritual
divine quality to human life,

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:90%
to all life.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.850 align:middle line:10%
And I think you can see that in
the realms of psychic research,

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.250 align:middle line:10%
and that it represents--

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.200 align:middle line:10%
it really represents
a way forward for us.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it represents
our own expansion.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
It represents us getting
bigger, getting deeper,

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:90%
life becoming more meaningful.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.780 align:middle line:10%
>> We have to learn to think
from the innermost level,

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.660 align:middle line:10%
which is the source of all
that there is on the surface.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.450 align:middle line:90%
We use the ocean analogy.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.150 align:middle line:84%
We have to go to the
bottom of the ocean.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Or we use, in physics,
the unified field analogy.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go to the
unified field, which

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:84%
is the source of all that
is manifest in the universe.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.013 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we
can achieve anything.

00:29:00.013 --> 00:29:02.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>> No doubt, consciousness,
super consciousness exists.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:14.040 align:middle line:10%
And to our viewers right now,
everything is possible in life.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:20.850 align:middle line:10%
Remember that there is nothing
that you cannot be, do, or have,

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:26.820 align:middle line:10%
because your mind power can
materialize things for you.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:32.550 align:middle line:10%
Your mind ability, your
super consciousness

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:10%
can do things for you.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:10%
If you think positive, you're
sending that message out

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:46.080 align:middle line:10%
to that universe, and it
brings it back to you.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychic abilities may not
be extraordinary exceptions,

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.460 align:middle line:84%
but an intrinsic part
of the human experience.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Could they represent
a fundamental aspect

00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:84%
of who we are, waiting for us
to unlock their full potential?

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.320 align:middle line:10%
Join us for more episodes
