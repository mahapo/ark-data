00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes it's like Velcro.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like you feel
yourself peeling away

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.668 align:middle line:90%
and you're like, whoa.

00:00:15.668 --> 00:00:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And you look back
at yourself and you

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.980 align:middle line:90%
see yourself lying there.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>> We have the ability to
navigate all of the realms.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:84%
We are made of light, just
holographic constructs

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
expressing itself

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:84%
as an individualized
essence of divinity.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Where ancient wisdom and
modern research converge,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.193 align:middle line:10%
Divine Science emerges.

00:00:39.193 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.990 align:middle line:84%
For centuries,
cultures worldwide

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.870 align:middle line:84%
have described the ability
to leave the physical body

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and a journey
beyond, an experience

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:84%
known as astral
projection, often

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.330 align:middle line:84%
reported during deep meditation,
near-death experiences,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and even on the cusp
of sleep states.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.890 align:middle line:84%
This phenomenon challenges
our conventional understanding

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
While similar to lucid dreaming,
where one becomes aware

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:84%
within the dream,
astral projection

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:84%
is considered a
distinct phenomenon

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:84%
that may occur spontaneously
or be entered intentionally,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:84%
involving a journey beyond the
confines of the physical body.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Could these
intersecting experiences

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:84%
deepen our understanding of the
very nature of consciousness

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:90%
itself?

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Astral projection is
the capacity of the person

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:10%
to leverage the faculties of
the astral body to reposition

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.373 align:middle line:10%
their perception
into a new location.

00:01:41.373 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Astral projection
and astral travel

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:90%
are essentially the same thing.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:84%
We just have different
levels of depth

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that someone may
choose to embark

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:90%
on this kind of experience.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So for example, at
the lightest level,

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.890 align:middle line:84%
astral projection
and astral travel

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
is simply a
projection of thought.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
It's me imagining myself in
the other side of this room

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
right now, and beginning
to have that experience.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
At the deepest level,
it's putting my body

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
all the way into a complete,
restful zero-point state,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and moving my entire
consciousness out of my body

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and across a room to have
a different experience.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.960 align:middle line:10%
>> I would say that astral
travel is floating around,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.360 align:middle line:10%
which you're sitting on a pure
level of consciousness and you

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.400 align:middle line:10%
allow your consciousness to
flow to wherever it wants--

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:10%
and it enjoys floating
here and there.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
But astral projection
is when you

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
would say, I want
my attention to go

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:84%
to see what's happening
with my friend,

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:84%
to see what's happening
in this situation,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and even project
yourself to the past

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
or project yourself
to the future,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:84%
because time and space are
no more a limiting factor.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So from the level
of consciousness.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to the level
of pure consciousness, which

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
is beyond time and
space, then you

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
can project yourself
to experience

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:84%
what will happen in the
future, what is happening now,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:90%
what has happened before.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is the simple
reality of consciousness

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:84%
being projected to
different places

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:90%
or different circumstances.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Astral is the esoteric term,
but it does feel like energy.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And in the yogic
tradition, they might call

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.140 align:middle line:90%
it bio-energy or a subtle body.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:10%
We feel like we have some
sort of malleable energy,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:10%
and this form can be
the shape of the body

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:10%
or you can be a point of
awareness, kind of like an orb.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And this can be very
big and very small.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And then this kind of
moves into other planes

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.540 align:middle line:84%
or what appears to be
different sorts of realities.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So the three parts are
a sense of separation,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
feeling like we
have another body,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and then traveling to other
realms of reality, planes

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:84%
of existence, and retrieving
some sort of information, often

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:90%
that benefits our lives.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:10%
>> You can't talk about astral
projection without understanding

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:10%
your soul.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:10%
You have a body, and inside
your body is your soul.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same
essence I believe

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:84%
that you use to go and travel
in your astral reality.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:90%
So you go to different places.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:90%
You feel yourself hovering.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.820 align:middle line:90%
You are your soul.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:84%
That soul then comes back
into your physical body,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and you, for the most
part, are consciously

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:84%
aware that you experienced
this amazing trek

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:84%
to another place on the
planet, or sometimes

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:90%
even on other planets.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And again, many people
learn to astral project.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Some people do it naturally.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Many people do it and are
totally unaware that they're

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:90%
doing it on a regular basis.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Many individuals
experience astral projection

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.770 align:middle line:84%
unintentionally through deep
relaxation or altered awareness,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:84%
often realizing they've
projected only after

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:84%
the experience concludes,
recalling sensations

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
of floating, traveling,
or observing from outside

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
But how does one
intentionally enter this state

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and navigate the unseen realms?

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> In the traditional occult
practice of astral projection,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:84%
a practitioner would
lay their body down,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
get into a theta state
essentially where their body is

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.400 align:middle line:84%
almost asleep, and then begin to
intentionally move their astral

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
awareness up and out of their
body and then across the room.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Astral projection is
done in the mind awake,

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:90%
body asleep state.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is when the body
is completely relaxed.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:90%
We cannot feel it.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
We have total body dissolution,
but the mind is awake and aware.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
This is often on
the cusp of sleep

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:84%
where most people have
spontaneous out-of-body

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Body falling asleep,
mind awake, and then they

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:84%
might feel like they're floating
out of the physical body.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But this can be in any situation
where the body is falling asleep

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.080 align:middle line:84%
or where it feels like
it's in a state of panic

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:90%
where it needs to cope.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:10%
>> While many experience astral
projection spontaneously,

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.640 align:middle line:10%
ancient traditions have
cultivated it as a deliberate

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:10%
practice.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian, Vedic,
Tibetan, and Shamanic

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.080 align:middle line:84%
teachings describe
methods of journeying

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical
form for wisdom,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:84%
healing, and remote
perception-- foundations that

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
continue to inspire
modern approaches today.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many practical
uses for astral projection.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:10%
For myself, I experienced that I
could leverage astral projection

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:10%
to be a better driver.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Simply by projecting my
consciousness forward

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%
down the highway, I could
feel if there's traffic,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I could feel if there's a
car coming around the curve

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
when I'm driving
on a mountain road.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:84%
There are many
different ways I could

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
use the extension
of my consciousness

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.900 align:middle line:84%
in different ways in
different directions,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to enhance my ability to respond
and react and move more quickly.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It's also very useful in
things like martial arts,

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.790 align:middle line:84%
because you can anticipate the
move of the other individual

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:84%
by sensing the astral mental
intent before their body

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:90%
actually acts.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We know they occur
for two reasons.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
The first is for survival
as a coping mechanism.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So if we are at a
crossroads in our life

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.350 align:middle line:84%
or we've had an accident
or we're giving birth

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and we're in labor, we can have
these spontaneous out-of-body

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:11.250 align:middle line:84%
experiences that are for I need
to get a bigger bird's eye view,

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.360 align:middle line:90%
see what's happening.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I need to be able to
remove myself to be

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:90%
able to cope with what's here.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:90%
But the second reason--

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and this is the one that
people do not talk about,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:90%
is evolutionary.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So in deep meditation,
they happen spontaneously.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:84%
In the yogic tradition,
it's considered a siddhi,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:84%
a superpower that often
happens through many years

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
of experience, of mindfulness,
of spiritual practice.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And also they can happen just
at a poignant time in our lives.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is because we come
out of body, we see something,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:84%
feel something, hear
something, retrieve

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.440 align:middle line:84%
an inner knowsis, an
inner knowing that

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:90%
deeply affects our lives.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:90%
And then there's a transition.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a shift
in consciousness.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And when we come
back to our body,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:84%
we are more reliant,
perhaps with our purpose.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And then that allows us to
self-actualize into existence

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:84%
a more fulfilled or more
joyful, better life.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> It depends on the soul's
goal in life to evolve

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:90%
or to experience.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of it comes from
the mental states,

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.260 align:middle line:84%
which is why many people
learn to astral project

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:84%
by focusing on certain desires
that they want to go experience

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:90%
or they want to go see.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, though, the soul--

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and I would say a
higher spirit guide

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
is in control, taking
you to places of learning

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and places of
greater understanding

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:84%
that you can bring
back to this reality

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and help you while
you live here.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers have sought
to understand the underlying

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms of astral projection.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:10%
Studies on out-of-body
experiences

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:10%
suggest that certain
individuals may be naturally

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.900 align:middle line:10%
predisposed, those
with heightened

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:10%
sensitivity or a strong
openness to new experiences.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Could these traits
provide insight

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
into why some can more easily
induce astral projection

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
while others struggle
to achieve it?

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So 10% of the population
actually have out-of-body

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:90%
experiences spontaneously.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So this means it's a
natural human experience.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:90%
So everyone can do it.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.990 align:middle line:84%
But there are some people that
find it easier than others.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:10%
So these are known as
trans liminal people.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:10%
How do if you're a
trans liminal person?

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.650 align:middle line:90%
You might be extra sensitive.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:45.200 align:middle line:84%
It means that you are deeply
connected to the threshold

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:84%
of what is beneath
your consciousness

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.210 align:middle line:90%
beneath the surface.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Another reason for
out-of-body experiences

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of the population would
be if on the psychology scale,

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:84%
you score quite high on being
open to new experiences,

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:90%
you're a risk taker.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability to
step into the unknown,

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
without being too
scared, you're more

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
likely to have an
out-of-body experience.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.410 align:middle line:10%
If out-of-body experiences
are a natural part

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:10%
of human experience,
what happens in the brain

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:10%
when they occur?

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:10%
Research using neurofeedback
devices like the mind mirror

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.950 align:middle line:10%
reveals a fascinating
pattern, one that challenges

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.170 align:middle line:10%
conventional neuroscience.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Instead of heightened
activity, as seen

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.780 align:middle line:84%
in dreaming or deep
meditation, the brainwaves

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
of experienced astral travelers
appear to quiet dramatically,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:84%
as if consciousness itself
is shifting elsewhere,

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:84%
raising new questions about
the nature of the mind.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Non-local consciousness,
having no time in it,

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:10%
has a curious way of showing
up on the mind mirror

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:01.020 align:middle line:10%
and in our session's Discovery
programs at the Monroe

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.820 align:middle line:10%
Institute.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.060 align:middle line:10%
I have seen countless
times people

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.060 align:middle line:10%
have this beautiful
awakened mind pattern,

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:10%
high, high amplitude.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, their
brainwaves just disappear.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:10%
They don't flatline.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:10%
They turn into these very,
very low amplitude patterns.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:10%
It lasts for maybe 10
seconds, and then boom,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:10%
they're back out again.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:84%
The first time I saw
it, I said, well, I

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.460 align:middle line:84%
think somebody went on
an out-of-body journey

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and there was nobody
home in the brain

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.480 align:middle line:84%
because the brainwaves
have disappeared.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:10%
The curious thing about it
is that, that 10 seconds,

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:10%
I saw their
amplitudes decreased.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:84%
They were in an out-of-body
state touring the world,

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:84%
landing at the
pyramids, seeing an eye

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.860 align:middle line:84%
in the top of the pyramids
walking with the spirit

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.100 align:middle line:84%
guide having all
of these incredibly

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
elaborate, detailed,
vivid experiences.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was only
10 seconds for me.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>> While out-of-body experiences
have long been described

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:84%
as mystical, emerging research
is uncovering their neurological

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:90%
foundations.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:10%
Studies using fMRI
reveal that OBEs

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.190 align:middle line:10%
involve key regions
of the brain linked

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:10%
to self-processing and spatial
awareness, particularly

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:10%
the Temporal Parietal
Junction, TPJ,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:10%
the cerebellum, and the
supramarginal and posterior

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:10%
superior temporal gyri.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.490 align:middle line:84%
These areas help construct our
sense of physical presence.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And when disrupted, they
may allow consciousness

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:84%
to shift beyond the body's
perceived boundaries.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Yet for many who
experience OBEs,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:84%
the impact goes far
beyond neuroscience,

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:84%
triggering profound
transformations

00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:00.190 align:middle line:84%
in identity, relationships,
and even a fundamental shift

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:90%
in how they view life and death.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:10%
>> In a peer reviewed
paper that I wrote,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:10%
I looked at the transformative
effects of what happens after

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:10%
you have an
out-of-body experience.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:10%
So I took a group
of healthy people,

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:10%
and then we asked them many
different sorts of questions,

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:10%
and we measured their experience
using lots of different scales.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:10%
Afterwards, there were
eight changes that no matter

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:10%
what the content
of the experience,

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.210 align:middle line:10%
no matter what they saw or felt,
they all had the same things.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:10%
The experience was a
motivational catalyst.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:10%
So basically after
they had it, there

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.272 align:middle line:10%
was a big change in their life.

00:14:35.272 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
This could be with their
relationship or their career

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:90%
or something else.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Then there was a
reduced fear of death.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of them didn't
fear death at all.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:10%
The third one was a
reevaluation of relationships.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So basically, people
reflecting back

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:84%
on who is in their life, their
partner, their friends, and they

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.020 align:middle line:84%
created new, better,
healthier friendships.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Another one was
increased inner peace.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So this idea of feeling
more inner peace

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.490 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
transformative effects.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:10%
The fifth one is people also
gained a new perspective

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:10%
on life.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.600 align:middle line:10%
Another of the
transformative effects

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.060 align:middle line:10%
was increased self-awareness
and a sense of individuality.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And the last one is
that they developed

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beliefs,
especially some

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.750 align:middle line:84%
of the agnostics and
atheists suddenly

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:90%
developed spiritual beliefs.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, from the
out-of-body experience,

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:84%
why it is so transformative
is because you

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
have this shift
in self-identity,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.250 align:middle line:84%
this kind of domino effect,
like a snowball that

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.183 align:middle line:84%
then leads to these
different life changes.

00:15:38.183 --> 00:15:42.010 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge amount of very
simple and subtle enhancements

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:84%
to almost anything we
want to do in our life

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
through strengthening our
capacity for astral projection.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's also about an
exploration of the self.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:84%
The deeper occult studies
of astral projection

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:84%
were about allowing
ourselves to be

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
more than just
the physical body,

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.900 align:middle line:84%
to get beyond the limit
of where we are and start

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:90%
to see at deeper levels.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a place
like Stonehenge

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and you just look at
the physical matter,

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:84%
you're only seeing a
tiny, tiny percentage

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:84%
of the information
that's actually there

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.850 align:middle line:90%
and is present all around you.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:84%
When you're able to
use your astral form

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and look at those stones, you'll
see ancient symbols held inside

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.340 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear the songs
of the druids that

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:90%
danced among the stones.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
You will feel the
energetic currents that

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:90%
were woven in those places.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So astral travel,
astral projection,

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:84%
building these
skills can actually

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:84%
enhance our spiritual
perception of reality.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Esoteric traditions have long
taught methods to refine astral

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:84%
projection, strengthening
perception beyond the physical

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.750 align:middle line:90%
senses.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, modern
research suggests

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:10%
that the temporal parietal
junction or TPJ, the brain

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:10%
region responsible for spatial
awareness and self-location

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:10%
plays a key role in
out-of-body experiences.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
Could these techniques
actively train the mind

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:26.329 align:middle line:84%
to expand perception, bridging
ancient wisdom with emerging

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:90%
scientific insights?

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.210 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a particular
technique for mastering astral

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:10%
projection that a gentleman
named Ophiel created many years

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:10%
ago, and the technique is
creating a series of alters

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:45.490 align:middle line:10%
where you would place a visual
object -playing cards are very

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.970 align:middle line:10%
useful for that- along with
a physical, sensory object,

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.650 align:middle line:10%
something that has a particular
smell and something that has

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle line:10%
a particular taste, as well as
something that makes a sound.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And then later when having
your meditation in the morning,

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:84%
you travel with your
mind over to that altar

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and you ring the bell,
you taste the candy,

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:84%
you smell the lavender,
you look at the card,

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and you're developing
your ability

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:84%
to use those senses
from your mental body.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And now when you
astral travel, you'll

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:84%
begin hearing things, smelling
things, tasting things.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.740 align:middle line:84%
You'll also notice that
you begin experiencing

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:90%
those things in your dreams.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The super cool thing about
out-of-body experiences is that

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:90%
it can be induced.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So you can do them
at will very safely.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And I use something
called state stacking.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's stacking
different altered states.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Some things work better for
some people and not others.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a
very visual person,

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:84%
it might be that certain
visualizations work well

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.470 align:middle line:84%
coupled with self-hypnosis
amongst maybe

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:84%
breathwork, binaural beats,
and sensory deprivation.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.350 align:middle line:90%
So there are three steps--

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:84%
the mind awake body asleep
state, the vibrational state,

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:90%
and then the exit technique.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And at each of these points,
there are various exercises

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that you can apply that
you stack to then be

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:90%
able to have that experience.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:84%
But then once you've gone
out of the body or beyond it,

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:84%
you've got the navigation,
you've got the control,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.392 align:middle line:84%
you've got your intention, your
plan, what do you want to do?

00:19:28.392 --> 00:19:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So I say to people, OK,
have a projection plan.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:90%
What's your intention?

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Your intention being,
what am I going to do?

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.070 align:middle line:84%
But, and this is the
secret to success,

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:90%
why am I going to do it?

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:90%
What's my motivation?

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And having a pure motivation
is super important

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
because if you do believe in
a higher power or a spirit

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.070 align:middle line:84%
guides or the universe
or even if you just

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.300 align:middle line:84%
believe in the power of
your own conscious mind,

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that's going to get
on board if you've

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.883 align:middle line:84%
got a very good reason for
doing it, like healing trauma,

00:19:57.883 --> 00:19:58.683 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:19:58.683 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>> If consciousness
is non-local,

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
existing beyond
the physical brain,

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:84%
then the astral body may not
be leaving the physical form,

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:84%
but tapping into a larger
system that encodes information,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.600 align:middle line:84%
emotions, and experiences
across space and time.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Could the very
structure of reality

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:84%
support and facilitate
these journeys?

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In my work in
unified physics,

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I've theorized that
protons are hard drives,

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and that they're all networked
and linked with each other

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.680 align:middle line:90%
through entanglement.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:84%
When you start to see that
matter works and operates

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:84%
this way, you start to wonder,
how does all that information

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:84%
get experienced through
our conscious bodies?

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
that we experience

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational levels of that
information as our emotions,

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and so our astral
bodies can literally

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.680 align:middle line:84%
use the network of the
structure of space time

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:84%
to be able to exchange
and gather information

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:84%
where our brains are working
to create the holographic map

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:90%
of that experience.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>> If we believe that astral
projection is going somewhere

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:84%
other than our own
body or our own mind,

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:84%
that we're entering a different
space, a different plane, realm,

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
existence, then theories of
non-local consciousness heavily

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:90%
support out-of-body experiences.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.460 align:middle line:84%
You've got non-local
consciousness,

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:84%
which allow for that person to
go into different time space

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:33.920 align:middle line:90%
periods.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So assuming these
theories are true,

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that 100% would evidence
out-of-body experiences

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:90%
and what people report.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Once you master the
field of consciousness,

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:10%
this is when you can transport
your consciousness through

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:54.940 align:middle line:10%
attention to different aspects
and then influence those

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:10%
aspects.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness is not
something limited in my body.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:84%
If you take it to a deeper level
and know that consciousness

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is non-local, then you can
understand the possibility

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:12.200 align:middle line:84%
of traveling with your awareness
and call it astral travel,

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> If consciousness can
extend beyond the body,

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.110 align:middle line:90%
can science measure its impact?

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Researchers are now testing
how self-induced out-of-body

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:28.420 align:middle line:84%
experiences may influence
not just perception, but even

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.140 align:middle line:84%
cellular biology, paving
the way for groundbreaking

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:90%
therapeutic applications.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.840 align:middle line:10%
>> We're now looking at the
world's first long-term study

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:10%
on how if you have the OBE,
out-of-body experience,

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:10%
you self-induce it, it can
affect your well-being and be

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.050 align:middle line:10%
sustainable in terms
of the transformation.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:10%
So I'm leading a study
where we look at that.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to look
at their cells, their DNA

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:84%
before the OBE, out-of-body
experience and after.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to look at OK, how

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
is this experience
influencing, if at all,

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:84%
the expression of your genes,
the very cells of your DNA?

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:10%
Now we know transpersonal
experiences,

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:10%
these kind of big spiritual
big awakening experiences,

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.710 align:middle line:10%
they do change the
expression of your genes.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:90%
We know that in science.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So, what is the most radical
transpersonal experience

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:24.460 align:middle line:90%
you can have?

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:90%
An out-of-body experience.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
have a look at this

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and then see how it
affects the cells.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
inspirations for this

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
is actually
Indigenous traditions

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:84%
because they look at healing
intergenerational trauma

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:90%
through astral projection.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take those findings

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and create a therapeutic model
that we're going to pilot

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:90%
in healthcare settings.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I think it could be a revolution
in mental health and well being.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientific inquiry into
out-of-body experiences is

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:84%
uncovering far
reaching implications,

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:84%
not just for healing, but for
how we understand the nature

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.830 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness itself.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:10.240 align:middle line:84%
If these experiences can alter
biology at a cellular level,

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:84%
could they also reveal the
deeper, multidimensional nature

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.120 align:middle line:90%
of our existence?

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:22.010 align:middle line:10%
>> So we can say that we are
beings of many different bodies,

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.270 align:middle line:10%
at many different levels.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're just
experiencing reality

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
through one
interface or another.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have the ability to
navigate all of the realms

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.350 align:middle line:84%
simply because we
are made of light

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and we're all just
holographic constructs

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
expressing itself

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.210 align:middle line:84%
as an individualized
essence of divinity.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>> If there's one thing I could
leave you with, it's this.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can astral project.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, it is
so incredible and magic.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can use it for
self-empowerment, self-growth,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:90%
and infinite potential.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Astral projection
transcends mere altered states.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:84%
It offers a striking
journey into unseen realms

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:84%
as science delves deeper into
its transformative potential.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.520 align:middle line:84%
This phenomenon reframes
our understanding

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and reality,
hinting at mysteries yet

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.330 align:middle line:90%
to be fully explored.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.090 align:middle line:10%
Join us for more episodes
on Divine Science,

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:10%
where we explore the
crossroads of modern research

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.200 align:middle line:10%
and ancient wisdom.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:90%
