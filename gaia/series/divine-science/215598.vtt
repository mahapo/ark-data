00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Could channeling be evidence
of a hidden connection

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.015 align:middle line:84%
to realms beyond our
physical reality?

00:01:10.015 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Often regarded as
a broad phenomenon,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
channeling encompasses
the ability

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:84%
to receive information and
energy beyond time and space,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.630 align:middle line:84%
whether as sudden,
intuitive insights,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
inspired downloads
of creativity,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.880 align:middle line:84%
or deep trance states where
individuals act as conduits

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:90%
for nonphysical beings.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
If consciousness extends
beyond the physical,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:84%
could channeling be a
bridge to greater truths

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:90%
waiting to be uncovered?

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.880 align:middle line:10%
>> The soul is your higher mind.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:10%
That's the nonphysical
part of you

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.510 align:middle line:10%
that then guides the
physical part of you

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:10%
on its journey in
having its dream

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:10%
that you call physical reality.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:10%
When I'm channeling Bashar,
it's like being caught up

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:10%
in a very energetic, very
vibrant daydream with images

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:10%
and feelings.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I often sort of liken it to
standing under a pounding

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:90%
waterfall of energy.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting this direct
feed, but all the people

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
are getting in the
audience is the spray.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.180 align:middle line:10%
>> When this started happening
with me and this voice was

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:10%
coming out of me and I was
totally in a trance state--

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:10%
What I felt in my body as
it came in the right side

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.610 align:middle line:10%
is like when you hit
your elbow and you

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:10%
have that tingling sensation,
it's not very comfortable.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:90%
My whole upper body did that.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.880 align:middle line:10%
>> When I channel, I
enter a field of energy.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:10%
It's a nonphysical realm
and there's an aspect of me

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:10%
that goes there, if you will.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm in that
field of energy,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
my senses expand
to such a degree

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:84%
where I can now pick up
information from messengers.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I also use the analogy that
it's like I'm driving the car,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm driving my vehicle.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
But when I allow Bashar to make
the connection telepathically,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
it's like feeling like I slide
over to the passenger seat,

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:90%
now he's behind the wheel.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And I can have a separate
conversation with him

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:90%
while he's talking to you.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's very
multidimensional in that way,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:90%
but I get a lot out of it.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.270 align:middle line:90%
It balances me, it energizes me.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:10%
What your vibration is,
is what you experience.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:10%
You cannot experience what you
are not the frequency of, this

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:10%
is just physics.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
You cannot experience what
you are not the vibration

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
of, and conversely, what you are
the frequency of is all that you

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:90%
will experience.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Channelers and mediums
describe a range of sources,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
offering a profound glimpse
into realms beyond the physical,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
from spiritual guides
to cosmic archives.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:84%
While science seeks to uncover
the underlying mechanisms

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.450 align:middle line:90%
that bridge these worlds.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But what or who is truly being
accessed through this process?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:10%
>> From a scientific lens, we
can't definitively prove what

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:10%
the source is, but we
have some potential ideas.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It could be coming from the
higher self of the channel

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:90%
medium.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:84%
It could be coming from
the unconscious mind

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:90%
or a transpersonal mind.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe it's
coming from the Akashic Record.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:84%
This idea of having a vast
information of all that

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
is past, present, and future
that is in the nonphysical realm

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:90%
that we have access to.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, trance
channelers would say,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm communicating with
a distinct personality

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:90%
that is nonphysical.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We express the
idea of Bashar,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and he expresses himself as
an extraterrestrial being.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:90%
He is a hybrid being.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
He is a first contact specialist
in his extraterrestrial

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the information
he's bringing through

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:84%
is one of the stages of making
contact with a new civilization.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Theo introduced themselves,
and when they came in, they

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.490 align:middle line:84%
said, we are 12 archangels and
we can be known collectively

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.010 align:middle line:90%
by the name Theo.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And they said we will
not identify singularly

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:84%
because it is not the
messenger that is important,

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:90%
it is the message.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So they've never
identified who the 12 are.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a lot of messengers.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are from what I
consider the angelic realm.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I have messengers that
do not self-identify,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and quite often I don't
even ask them, who are you,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:90%
or where are you from?

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the information
I've received is what's key

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's
important to me.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So the message is more
important than who it's from.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>> In the state of channeling,
it's possible to access

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:84%
information from what most
people refer to as the Akashic

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Records, which just is
another way of saying that all

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:84%
information is embedded in
the matrix of space time.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you are in the
right frequency that

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:84%
matches the frequency of the
information you're seeking,

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.317 align:middle line:84%
that information will
automatically be there.

00:06:51.317 --> 00:06:52.900 align:middle line:84%
You will know it,
you'll connect to it

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's all about
resonance and harmonics.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So it can allow you to
function telepathically

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:84%
with another being who can
function on a similar wavelength

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's what's
happening in my channeling

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.190 align:middle line:84%
with Bashar is that
I've been trained

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:84%
to take my brain to a
certain frequency level,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and he alters his brain
frequencies to become something

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:90%
closer to mine.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in the
middle we lock step.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're getting is
a translation of his thoughts

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
through my brain into the
language I understand.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really functioning
like a translation

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:90%
device for his thoughts.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:10%
Any individual consciousness,
whether they know it or not,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.610 align:middle line:10%
is already always
plugging in and unplugging

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.870 align:middle line:10%
from parallel incarnations
to download information,

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.230 align:middle line:10%
experience, and
energy that they may

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:10%
need for their particular
linear timeline,

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:10%
while other incarnations
that simultaneously exist

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:10%
may also be plugging and
unplugging into them to download

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:10%
information and energy for
their particular timeline.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a dynamic
interactive network

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:84%
of exchanges of energy and
information and experience going

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:84%
on constantly all the
time automatically.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:10%
>> What I call the quantum
C, or field of light,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.130 align:middle line:10%
profoundly influences
channeling and channelers,

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:10%
primarily because it is an
energy that has a direct effect

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:10%
on the human
biosystem, biofield.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And that person evolves not
only on the physical level,

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.820 align:middle line:90%
but their brainwaves evolve too.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
We see amazing differences
in the mind mirror

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:84%
between a person who is
grounded in physical reality

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and a person who has
connected with that field.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:55.290 align:middle line:84%
We can absolutely pinpoint
the moment of connection.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>> To study brainwave activity,
some scientists use the mind

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
mirror, an EEG technology
designed to display brainwave

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:90%
patterns in real time.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:10%
By visually representing
these dynamic patterns,

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.750 align:middle line:10%
the mind mirror is used to
explore states of consciousness,

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:10%
enhance mental clarity,
and support personal growth

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.500 align:middle line:10%
through neurofeedback.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had my brainwaves
measured through EEGs

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:90%
at the Monroe Institute.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was at a
week long program called

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Discovery where Judith
Pennington from the institute

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.640 align:middle line:84%
for the awakened mind
uses what she calls

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:90%
is the mind mirror protocol.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.070 align:middle line:10%
So while all of the participants
are hooked up to EEGs,

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:10%
we then go into a
meditative state

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:10%
and her brainwaves
are mapped out

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:10%
in this beautiful format
that's easy to understand.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>> On the mind mirror, what we
see in the typical person is

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.520 align:middle line:84%
an hourglass shaped
brainwave pattern,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
where the thinking mind is in
control and busy with to do

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:90%
lists and decision making.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:10%
And if it's really busy,
we see a very splayed

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:10%
beta conscious mind that's
associated with stress, anxiety,

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:10%
and panic.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And because that's
what's going on,

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:84%
they don't have any diffuse
daydreaming alpha or the bridge

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and thus access to
the deeper mind.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:10%
They will have their
radar, their delta,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:10%
because that's instinctual.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:10%
Everybody is watching
their back all the time,

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.510 align:middle line:10%
thus the hourglass.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:10%
For the awakened mind, what we
see is a rounding of the beta

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:10%
so that the thinking
mind is connected

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:10%
to all of its different levels.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:10%
And then for gamma, we
see the awakened mind

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:10%
with a big halo on
top of the head,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.730 align:middle line:10%
moving up into the
higher frequencies.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:10%
It's really uncanny how this
is like a holographic depiction

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness that
we're seeing in the mind

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:10%
mirror with tremendously
precise accuracy

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.590 align:middle line:10%
depicts their state
of consciousness.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So when their state of
consciousness changes,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.530 align:middle line:90%
their brainwaves change.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
how we teach

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.100 align:middle line:84%
people to master
their brainwaves

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
to be able to access more
expanded and advanced

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.760 align:middle line:90%
levels of consciousness.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>> My takeaway was
my experience itself.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.290 align:middle line:84%
My experience, I would feel
myself leaving the body.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I could feel myself
connecting with entities,

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:90%
and I knew that was real.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the 5D in
those nonphysical realms,

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
your senses are so keen you see
what you can't see in the 3D.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
It was those
extraordinary experiences

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:84%
that Judith can
explain away when you

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:90%
look at the brainwave activity.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But it gave me the proof to show
that what I was experiencing

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:14.530 align:middle line:84%
was true and measurable
with science.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>> In a study with Darryl Anka,
researchers sought to uncover

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
the neurological changes
that occur during channeling.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.820 align:middle line:10%
They compared his
baseline state to what

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:10%
happens when he channels
the entity known as Bashar.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:84%
What they discovered
raised profound questions

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of
consciousness and personality.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We did a session
in a channeling state,

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and before the channeling state
with someone who was an expert

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.817 align:middle line:84%
in brainwave reading in EEG,
and my head was wired up.

00:12:46.817 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
first thing they do

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.180 align:middle line:84%
is they get what
they call a baseline.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So they talk to me
as myself so that we

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:84%
can see what areas of my
brain are active or inactive

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:90%
during a typical conversation.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I went into
the channeling state,

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and they would look and see
when the entity is talking,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:90%
what's happening in the brain.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.900 align:middle line:10%
In the beginning
of the channeling,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:10%
the channel was capable of
holding on to, shall we say,

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.680 align:middle line:10%
or bringing through the idea of
about 1.5% to 2% of our energy.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:84%
There are several surprising
things that we've discovered

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:84%
that are very different in
the brain from when I'm, quote

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
unquote "myself," as opposed to
when Bashar is coming through

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:90%
and what I'm connecting to.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
we discovered is

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
there is a certain
center of the brain that

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for
processing my personality

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and during the channeling that
shuts off, it's not there.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So my question would be,
well, if my brain centers

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:84%
that process my personality
is shut down, who's talking?

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Another key observation
involves the set point,

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:03.210 align:middle line:84%
a stable baseline in how the
brain processes information,

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:84%
typically constant
throughout life.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Yet during channeling,
unexpected deviations

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
from this baseline
emerged, challenging

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:84%
our understanding
of how consciousness

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.980 align:middle line:90%
interacts with the brain.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>> That is never supposed to
change over your lifetime unless

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:84%
you have some traumatic head
injury or something that

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:84%
completely messes up your
neurology, then it will change.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
But in a normal individual,
it's not supposed to change.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:10%
During the channeling,
the set point

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.950 align:middle line:10%
goes up in seconds, more
so when Bashar is listening

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:10%
than when he's talking.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Another feature that
goes on in the channeling

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:49.940 align:middle line:84%
is the processing speed, that
speeds up incredibly fast so

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:84%
that my brain is making more
connections than it normally

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
does, different connections
than it normally does,

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.420 align:middle line:90%
different associations.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:84%
It's synthesizing information
in a very different way

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:84%
so that it can
deliver what needs

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:90%
to be delivered very quickly.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:84%
There was an analysis that was
done of the vocalizations that

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:90%
come through me when I channel.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
They recorded a
session, they put it

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:84%
through whatever device they
were using to analyze this,

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and they were saying,
there are some sounds

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.090 align:middle line:84%
that are coming out of your
vocal box that are not capable,

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
supposedly, of being made
by a human vocal box.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I only say good day to
you this day of your time,

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.720 align:middle line:90%
how are you all?

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Another analysis performed
on Darryl Anka while channeling

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Bashar is called
lexical density,

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.530 align:middle line:84%
which measures how much
meaningful information is

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.730 align:middle line:90%
conveyed in speech or text.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:84%
This method examines the balance
between essential content

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and less significant words,
providing fascinating insights

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:84%
into the clarity and
depth of information

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:90%
during his channeling sessions.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Their computer scale
was basically 1 to 10,

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:84%
10 being the most information
in the fewest words,

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:84%
1 being the least amount of
information and the most words.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:84%
They said Bashar's information
went beyond the scale.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't measure it
because the way he communicates

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
gives so much information very
efficiently in as few words as

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.050 align:middle line:10%
Learning never
ends, growing never

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.620 align:middle line:10%
ends because it never began.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.610 align:middle line:10%
It just is.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:10%
That's the nature of existence
to be all that it is.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.680 align:middle line:90%
And it is infinite and eternal.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:84%
When someone asks a question,
he delivers the answer totally,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:90%
all at once in a holistic bite.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Then it's simply unspooling
over time into my language,

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.460 align:middle line:84%
my brain is acting as
the unspooling mechanism.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So the entire answer
is already there,

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
so it's not like he has to
think about what he's saying.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just like,
here's the answer.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And then my mouth and my brain
are going a, b, c, d, e, f, g.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.839 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's just
recording what's already there.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:18.050 align:middle line:84%
There's no time to stop and go,
oh, let me think about that.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So those are all the analysis
that have been done to date

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and so it's very interesting
to see definitely

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.103 align:middle line:84%
that channeling is a
definitely altered state,

00:17:28.103 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
very different things

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
happening in the brain when a
channeling session takes place.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Changes in brain activity
are only part of the story.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
During the channeling state,
measurable physiological shifts

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:84%
such as changes in
the nervous system

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:84%
offer deeper insights
into the connection

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:90%
between mind and body.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the
physiology of trance channelers

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:58.540 align:middle line:84%
during the channeling state,
most studies show an activation

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:84%
of the nervous system, meaning
like a fight or flight response.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:07.040 align:middle line:10%
They have increased
adrenaline, noradrenaline,

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.380 align:middle line:10%
increased heart rate,
increased muscular tone.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Most studies have shown this
hyperactivation, if you will,

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.320 align:middle line:90%
of the nervous system.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.490 align:middle line:84%
These hyperactive
findings in the physiology

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:84%
of trance channelers
is quite interesting

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.160 align:middle line:84%
because often they need to go
into a relaxed meditative type

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.650 align:middle line:84%
state to get into
the channeling state.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So it seems counterintuitive
that their physiology

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:84%
would be hyperactive during the
actual trance channeling itself.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a big difference
between a channeler who is

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:84%
speaking what's
received out loud,

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and a channeler who's
sitting in silent meditation,

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and the channeler who's
actually speaking.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
exhilarated by the energies

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and the information coming in
and just the act of speaking

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:84%
is going to raise
the heart rate.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:09.930 align:middle line:84%
The differences in demeanor
when a channel suddenly

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:15.330 align:middle line:84%
shifts to a deeper voice or
a different way of holding

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:84%
the body, literally has
to do with the energy

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:84%
of, in that case,
an entity that's

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.530 align:middle line:90%
coming to and through them.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, the body itself
can indeed transition,

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.742 align:middle line:10%
can indeed transition to a
level of tone where it may be

00:19:31.742 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:10%
in coherence, where it may be in
coherence with the upper realms,

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:35.980 align:middle line:10%
with the upper realms.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.770 align:middle line:10%
But the senses must align,
but the senses must align.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:10%
The identity must
align, the identity must

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.363 align:middle line:10%
align to knowing who
and what you truly are,

00:19:42.363 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:10%
to know who and
what you truly are.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.300 align:middle line:10%
>> It really can't be anything
else because if the quantum sea

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:10%
of light is
undifferentiated energy,

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:10%
then it has to be
the personality,

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.800 align:middle line:10%
the sole consciousness of a
specific entity that would wreak

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:10%
that change on a person.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The channeler doesn't
change the voice,

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
the energy changes the voice
because it is a different

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.130 align:middle line:84%
energy, it's a
different personality,

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and it does actually make
physical changes in the body.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.070 align:middle line:84%
It can alter the voice box,
it can alter the expression

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:90%
on the face.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.600 align:middle line:84%
It can alter the
tone of the voice

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:84%
because the human brain is
trying to make sense out

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:90%
of what it's connecting to.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times there will
be what sounds like an accent,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
but it's really the
human brain trying

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.730 align:middle line:84%
to make sense out of what it
feels is foreign coming through.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And also the entity itself may
be stressing certain things that

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
then come out in unusual
ways, in ways that we're not

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.510 align:middle line:90%
typically used to speaking.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So the changes
that do take place

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:84%
are the result of trying to
allow a different frequency

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:84%
of energy in a
different personality

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:84%
to express itself in a way
that makes sense for it, that

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
allows it to come
through more smoothly.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes that just results
in the typical personality

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:84%
getting out of the way
and allowing the changes

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to happen that are necessary
for the other entity

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.975 align:middle line:90%
to express itself clearly.

00:21:11.975 --> 00:21:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We enjoy the experience
of the human body,

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.500 align:middle line:90%
which we have not had.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:84%
We are aware of the
sensory perceptivities

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:90%
that this vehicle allows.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Periodically there
is adjustments,

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%
let's say, to those
frequencies and vibrations

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.420 align:middle line:84%
for the ease and grace
of communication.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:10%
>> We thank you for allowing
us, in this co-creation,

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:10%
to share this idea of the
connection of two worlds,

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:10%
physical and nonphysical in
this endeavor of open contact.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And we encourage you to
accelerate this activity as you

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.660 align:middle line:90%
go forward in your lives.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientific testing and
validation are essential

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:84%
for understanding
phenomena like channeling,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:05.080 align:middle line:84%
which challenges
traditional perspectives.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Through rigorous
study, science can

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.540 align:middle line:84%
provide credibility
and insight, helping

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to expand awareness and
foster greater acceptance

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:90%
of this extraordinary practice.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>> There is limited science
around trance channeling,

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and yet I'm an advocate
for a great deal more.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:84%
This language of
science can really

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:84%
open the worldview
of many people

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:84%
who would outright dismiss it
as impossible, or too fringe,

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:84%
or completely made up, or
even, at the worst case,

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:90%
some mental health pathology.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So using the
language of science,

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:50.230 align:middle line:84%
we can really help open people's
awareness to this phenomenon

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.630 align:middle line:90%
and discover more about it.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Without scientific
testing, measurements,

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:84%
validation that channeling
would still be in the dark ages

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:90%
of devil worship.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's only when,
I guess, 10 years ago

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
that people started
to pay attention

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:84%
to the workings of the brain
and validate that there were

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
changes, things are
actually happening

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
that people began to say,
oh, so your brainwave changes

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and your state of
consciousness are related.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And once they made
that connection,

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:84%
then more people
ultimately became

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:84%
willing to test
it for themselves

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.520 align:middle line:84%
because a trust grew out
of that scientific study.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:10%
>> But I do think that
scientists have to incorporate

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:10%
consciousness in
their equations.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.550 align:middle line:84%
It has to be considered
an actual tangible field

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.800 align:middle line:84%
that we all interact
with, and that it

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.580 align:middle line:84%
is first before physicality
so that they can understand

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that all things that
are happening in physics

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
come from the level of
consciousness first.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> When consciousness is
the foundation of reality,

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:84%
shaping the physical world from
a higher nonphysical blueprint,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.990 align:middle line:84%
what does this say
about our own potential?

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:16.630 align:middle line:10%
>> We propose that
everybody, all humans,

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:20.230 align:middle line:10%
have the capacity to
channel in some way,

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:25.020 align:middle line:10%
and that the way that it shows
up for them is unique to them

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:31.090 align:middle line:10%
and they can, through their
own personal intention,

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:35.160 align:middle line:10%
setting the intention that
they would like to develop

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.740 align:middle line:10%
their channeling abilities
and setting aside,

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:10%
even if it's just a few minutes
a day to sit in stillness

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:10%
and quiet to go internally and
ask for that to be strengthened

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:55.680 align:middle line:10%
can begin to develop their
own channeling ability.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:02.350 align:middle line:10%
>> You all have a truth
barometer within you.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a visceral experience.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability to
receive guidance consistently

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:15.410 align:middle line:84%
in the asking and in
the asking it is given.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Be open to receive.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Increased study of these
states would wake up the entire

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:29.190 align:middle line:10%
world and start a whole new
age of self-understanding,

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:10%
self-awareness,
self-development,

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:10%
self-evolution.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:84%
I hope the day will
come when that happens.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Right now it's
just a sprinkling,

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:84%
but someday it may be a deluge
of interest and understanding

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.790 align:middle line:84%
of the realization that if
you want to fix the world,

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:52.010 align:middle line:90%
we have to fix ourselves first.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Bashar said that
from their perspective,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.170 align:middle line:84%
interacting with us is like
watching a 7-foot tall person

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:03.540 align:middle line:84%
trying to stuff themselves
into a 1-foot tall box.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.350 align:middle line:10%
We limit ourselves so much when
we have so much more potential.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.480 align:middle line:10%
We're so much bigger
than what we think.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.390 align:middle line:10%
So they perceive us that
way and they understand

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:10%
Earth as a challenging school.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But we are powerful
spirits who have decided

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:84%
to come into this
challenging school

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.140 align:middle line:84%
because he's saying
they don't see us

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.150 align:middle line:84%
as a bunch of
kindergartners, they see us

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.970 align:middle line:90%
as a master graduating class.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:90%


00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>> As scientific inquiry
explores what lies beyond

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.100 align:middle line:84%
the physical, channeling emerges
as a bridge connecting us

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:45.050 align:middle line:84%
to unseen realms at an inherent
universal consciousness.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Could this profoundability
unlock how much more

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:90%
we are truly capable of?

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:56.520 align:middle line:10%
Join us for more episodes
on Divine Science,

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.590 align:middle line:10%
where we continue exploring the
crossroads of modern research

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.980 align:middle line:10%
and ancient wisdom.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:90%
