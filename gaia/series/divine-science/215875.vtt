>> The chakras can teach us
how to work with our quantum

functions and how to engage
with the quantum field in deeper

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.060 align:middle line:90%
and more profound ways.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if we were
designed with an augmentation

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.670 align:middle line:84%
system, an advanced technology
that would enable us to relate

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%
with the universe in fantastic
and almost unimaginably advanced

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.000 align:middle line:90%
ways.

Divine Science emerges.

00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.640 align:middle line:10%
For centuries,
tantric traditions

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:10%
originating in
ancient India have

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:10%
spoken of chakras, vital
energy centers that

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:10%
run along the spine, and that
govern the flow of life force

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:10%
within us.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Each of these chakras influences
different aspects of our lives,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.030 align:middle line:84%
holding the potential to
guide us toward optimal health

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.620 align:middle line:90%
and well-being.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
But what if these energetic
vortices aren't just

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:90%
moderating internal energies?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:84%
What if they are finely tuned
interfaces, biological gateways

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:84%
to engage with the
quantum field itself?

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.490 align:middle line:10%
>> In the Vedic tradition
of the Far East,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:10%
we have seven basic chakras.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:10%
The word in Sanskrit
means wheel or wheel work.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:84%
When we speak of chakras,
we're speaking of those energy

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:84%
thresholds where basing events
of biophysical and genetic

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.690 align:middle line:90%
engineering take place.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:10%
>> The chakras are energetic
vortices of space time,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:10%
where a subtle quantum field
resonance is vibrating its way

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:10%
into the center of the body,
bringing in specific information

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:10%
for a specific purpose.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Each of the chakras is
an interface to reality.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:84%
The same way as a computer has
a power cable, a USB cable,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:84%
a video port, we have different
ports within our bodies

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to have different
kinds of external experience

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and manage that experience from
a single, unified operating

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.112 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:02:29.112 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:10%
>> The chakras in the Vedic
system come mostly from tantric

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:10%
tradition that uses techniques
to inspire different parts

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:10%
of the physiology and
energy in the body.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And our body has
different aspects to it

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
that correspond to different
physiological areas,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
starting from the seat of the
body where we are sitting,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.120 align:middle line:84%
the pelvic area, and
going gradually up

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.586 align:middle line:84%
to the head where we have
the highest value there.

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> This ancient practice of
looking at how we receive

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and exchange energy with the
universe around us was refined

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.470 align:middle line:84%
into a formula where we would
look at each of the facets

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.020 align:middle line:84%
of how we experience the world
and learn to interpret those

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
as different organs
inside of our being.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:84%
In the same way as
your heart pumps blood

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and your stomach digests
food, each of your chakras

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:84%
complete a certain part
of your process in how

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:90%
you relate with everything.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:84%
These vehicles are more
than just ancient concepts.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.870 align:middle line:10%
The NASA astrophysicist
Barbara Ann Brennan

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:10%
took instruments and
measured the chakras,

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:10%
and was able to show
very specifically

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.373 align:middle line:10%
that different tonal vibrations
exist in each of these regions.

00:03:58.373 --> 00:04:01.052 align:middle line:10%


00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Although variations
exist across traditions,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:10%
the chakras are most commonly
understood as a seven-part

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:10%
system with
individual functions.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:10%
The root chakra at
the base of the spine

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:10%
anchors us in survival,
stability, and safety.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:10%
The sacral chakra in the lower
abdomen fuels creativity,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:10%
emotions, and sexuality.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:10%
The solar plexus chakra
in the upper abdomen

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:10%
powers our will and self-esteem.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:10%
The heart chakra in
the chest connects us

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:10%
to other people to
love and empathy.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:10%
The throat chakra expresses our
communication and authenticity.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:10%
The third eye chakra
in the forehead

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:10%
guides our intuition
and psychic insight.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:10%
And at the top, the
crown chakra opens us

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:10%
to spiritual connection of
universal consciousness.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:10%
Intriguingly, modern
science has begun

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:10%
to link these ancient energy
centers to specific endocrine

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:10%
glands, suggesting a
deep interconnection

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:10%
between the body's physiology
and our spiritual essence.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Each of the chakras also
relates to a specific endocrine

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:90%
gland process.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:10%
Our endocrine glands
form chemicals

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:10%
that allow our body to change
into different kinds of states.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:10%
So when our throat chakra
is healthy, for example,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:10%
our thyroid will
also be healthy.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough, the thyroid

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
is in many ways responsible
for our immunity, our ability

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
to deal with
external influences--

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
external physical influences,
and radiation, things like that.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can see how
the throat chakra

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
is managing our
physical relationship

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:90%
with the world around us.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, if you go
back down the chakras

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and you start talking about
things like testosterone,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:84%
the root and the
sacral have a lot

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to do with the production of
testosterone within our gonads.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And so how we actually feel
safe or not in our bodies

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.690 align:middle line:84%
is in many ways of
relating to whether or not

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:84%
we're releasing these kinds
of chemicals into our body

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and/or needing to
have more testosterone

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
in order to process more
violent kinds of experiences.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So each of our endocrine
glands are, in many ways,

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:84%
adapting our
physiological structure

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to match the needs of our life
experience, which is being

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.433 align:middle line:90%
interpreted by the chakras.

00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:44.116 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.116 --> 00:06:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Traditionally, the chakras
are activated by awakening

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:90%
the life force, or Kundalini--

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
the serpentine energy coiled
at the base of the spine--

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:90%
and drawing it upward.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.780 align:middle line:84%
This rising energy catalyzes
altered states of consciousness,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:84%
unlocking access to
higher dimensions.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Kundalini energy is the
flow of the chakras energy,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:84%
one from the other, going up all
the way to the top of the head.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:84%
That energy of life
that is flowing,

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:84%
which is the center of the
spinal cord, which has fluid

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:90%
in it, is called the sushumna.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And wherever the flow of energy
from the bottom part of the body

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:84%
all the way up is
circulating properly,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.070 align:middle line:84%
then you have what is called the
full value of Kundalini, which

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:84%
is the energy of
life that is usually,

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:84%
in the tradition, supposed
to go up to the higher value

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.590 align:middle line:84%
so that the spiritual
value is emphasized

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:84%
from the physical
needs and desires.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
But its ultimate goal
is to bring it up

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.975 align:middle line:84%
to this full awakening in the
higher values of the brain.

00:08:00.975 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The experience of Kundalini
is often this growing serpentine

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
charge that's moving up the
central pillar of the body,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:84%
the Ida and Pingala serpents,
traveling along the central

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
pillar up and down
through the body.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.920 align:middle line:84%
As Kundalini rises
and emerges, it

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:84%
will surge up through
the body but stop

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
anywhere there is constriction,
restriction, blockages,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:84%
limited beliefs, wherever
we're holding it back.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And so by opening
each of the chakras,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:84%
we allow our bodies to
come into greater balance

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.809 align:middle line:84%
and allow the Kundalini
to flow through.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Often people going through
a Kundalini awakening

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:84%
will come up against a
certain level in their body

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that the energy
doesn't want to move.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And the Kundalini will
then stimulate new kinds

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.880 align:middle line:84%
of experiences in their
life that will, in a way,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.010 align:middle line:84%
force them to look at
this part of themselves,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:84%
where they've been
resistant, and start

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
to melt that resistance,
open up, and allow themselves

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.392 align:middle line:84%
to have the full and complete
experience of their reality.

00:09:15.392 --> 00:09:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>> In recent years, modern
research has begun to confirm

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.780 align:middle line:84%
what age-old practices
have long known,

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:90%
that we are vibrational beings.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:10%
The subtle energy field
that surrounds and permeates

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:10%
all living beings is now
recognized scientifically

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:10%
as the biofield--

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:10%
a field of energy
and information

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.990 align:middle line:10%
that plays a fundamental
role in regulating the body's

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:10%
homeo dynamic functions.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Within the biofield, the
chakras are considered the seven

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.140 align:middle line:84%
major energy centers that help
maintain its balance and flow.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The human energy field
or biofield is really just

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:84%
a generative combination
of all of the energy of all

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:06.610 align:middle line:84%
of the matter and all of the
ways that matter forms your DNA,

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:84%
forms your chromosomes, forms
your cells, forms your organs.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:84%
All that energy
and all the protons

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and their electrons,
all that electricity

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:84%
is all co-combining
together, moving up

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:84%
into larger and
larger structures.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And then each of
those structures

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:84%
have a specific resonance,
a specific tone,

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:90%
a vibration that goes with them.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And so our biofield
is, in many ways,

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:84%
emergent from the
structure of space itself.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:84%
We could say that
we are an output

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:84%
of the universal
lattice of energy

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and a specific individualized
instance of that.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.280 align:middle line:84%
But we also have total
sovereignty and command

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:84%
over this incredible
experience that we're

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:90%
having within our own bodies.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
very special thing

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:84%
that we each get to
experience the universe

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:84%
through our own
individuation, that we all

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.942 align:middle line:84%
can be infinitely different,
and that that's also perfect.

00:11:08.942 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:10%
>> If we look at the movements
of thought going all the way

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.080 align:middle line:10%
back to the thinkers of
the 18th and 19th century,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.930 align:middle line:10%
up through research done by Sir
Arthur Eddington in the 1940s,

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.200 align:middle line:10%
1946, who said that
consciousness is really

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:10%
the study of the
rule of physics,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.940 align:middle line:10%
to more recent research
that has been done in Russia

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:10%
and in Germany by such
celebrated scientists

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:10%
as Fritz-Albert Popp, that
the human body was a series

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:10%
of energy fields that
collectively would define life

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.360 align:middle line:10%
or the process of life.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
the graduation that

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
is taking place in
science has been

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
to understand the human
body as a vibratory system

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:90%
of many fields.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:10%
The end result being
that we are now

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:10%
seeing what could be defined
as a vibratory medicine,

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:07.840 align:middle line:10%
a vibratory psychology, a
vibratory physics of realizing

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:10%
that acoustical physics is
the key to the understanding

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:10%
of the human biofield,
without which we are just

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:10%
dealing with parts.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So, to put it simply,
we are at a stage

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:84%
now of recognizing
for the first time

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
that the human biofield,
whether it's the mind

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
or it's the whole energy
enterprise of evolution,

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
are all nurtured in
consciousness, capital C.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The chakras are not just
energetic ports in our biofield

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:84%
that connect our bodies to the
vast unified field of energy,

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:45.250 align:middle line:84%
they also function as electrical
capacitors which direct

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and store this energy, allowing
us to interpret it and derive

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.476 align:middle line:90%
meaning from our experiences.

00:12:51.476 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The chakras are the
energy doors or the vibratory

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:84%
thresholds which allow us to see
the complete synergy of life.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to
see how they are all

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
interconnected with the type
of vibratory orchestration

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:84%
whereby we are conductors
of our own body.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
But by virtue of understanding
the human biofield,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.120 align:middle line:84%
we understand the relationship
of the other fields

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.475 align:middle line:84%
that are all converged as a
higher evolutionary process.

00:13:22.475 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The chakras can be
individually measured within

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.240 align:middle line:90%
our biofield.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that there's
a direct interaction

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:84%
between the level
of charge flowing

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
within our biological field
and the level of charge that's

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:84%
able to emanate in each
of these major centers

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:90%
throughout our body.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's good to keep
in mind that we also

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.050 align:middle line:84%
have many, many minor chakras,
smaller vortices of energy that

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:84%
enter our body in different
zones and energy areas.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
For example, each of
the major acupuncture

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and acupressure points
within our meridian lines

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:84%
could be said to
be a minor chakra.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:06.830 align:middle line:84%
As an electrical body,
you have certain areas

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:12.510 align:middle line:84%
where that electricity is going
to center into capacitors.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And you could look at
the center of each chakra

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:84%
as a form of
electrical capacitor.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So as the biofuel
is moving, it's

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:84%
moving, orienting, rotating, and
vortexing around those capacitor

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
positions to store energy,
route it, and enable

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:84%
it to be exchanged
and interpreted

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.212 align:middle line:84%
between different
parts of our system.

00:14:35.212 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:10%
>> The knowledge and practices
for activating the chakras have

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:10%
been passed down for
thousands of years,

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:10%
yet it's only in recent
times that science has begun

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:10%
to thoroughly investigate
the existence, purpose,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.720 align:middle line:10%
and potential of these spinning
energy wheels within the body.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we've learned
scientifically that those who

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:10%
have been studied principally,
the yogis, swamis, the shamans,

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:10%
under scientific conditions,
have shown that the human heart

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.340 align:middle line:10%
rate can be controlled.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:10%
The temperature of
the individual organs

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:10%
can be controlled.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:10%
The life cycle can be elongated
with proper chakra resonance.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the whole
field of medicine

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.710 align:middle line:90%
can be turned upside down.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:10%
And we can be more life
orientated rather than

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle line:10%
death orientated
by understanding

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.720 align:middle line:10%
the circulatory mechanisms of
every part of our body, which

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:10%
is signaled in the way the
chakras were placed again

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:10%
as the central nodal points.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Our body, in my logic,
is a musical system.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:84%
We are a musical instrument
in anatomical form.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's only when
we play the chakras,

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:84%
like musicians played
the flute or the horn,

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
do we understand
the energy field

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:84%
or the background of what the
ancient philosophers called

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.500 align:middle line:90%
similitude?

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:84%
When we understand the field
or the background field,

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
then the chakras
by themselves take

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:84%
on a higher meaning of a
collective consciousness,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.000 align:middle line:84%
a collective medicine,
a collective psychology.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Of and by themselves, they
are simply abstract concepts

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:84%
of Eastern philosophy
that have very little

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.272 align:middle line:84%
meaning until recent scientific
investigations by my colleagues.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>> If chakras are the individual
gateways through which we

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.620 align:middle line:84%
connect to the quantum field,
then how do we actually engage

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:90%
with this vast cosmic energy?

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And what does this advanced
biotechnology within our bodies

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.815 align:middle line:84%
reveal about our intended
relationship with the universe?

00:16:40.815 --> 00:16:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> We can see an intersection
in our understanding of quantum

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:84%
mechanics with the chakra system
and our experience of reality

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:55.810 align:middle line:84%
by understanding that we're in
what's called a quantum wave

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
The quantum wave field has many
different vibrational states.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And everything that we
experience is in one or more

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:05.700 align:middle line:90%
of these states.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:84%
Now, we must have some way to
interact with these states.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:90%
We have to.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:84%
And it's more than just
our tissues of our cells

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:84%
and our nervous system
coming into contact

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:90%
with objects around us.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.670 align:middle line:84%
We have deeper,
innate vehicles that

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:84%
are able to interpret
these quantum states

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and translate those to
emotions, translate those

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:84%
to mental visualizations,
translate those

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:90%
to interpersonal experience.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So the chakras, I
believe, also can

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.210 align:middle line:84%
teach us how to work with
our quantum functions

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and how to engage with the
quantum field in deeper

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:90%
and more profound ways.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if we were
designed with an augmentation

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:84%
system, an advanced technology
that would enable us to relate

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:84%
with the universe in fantastic
and almost unimaginably advanced

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And so each chakra has a
particular vibrational,

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.090 align:middle line:84%
structural, geometric
interface that's

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
able to speak to parts of
the physics of space time.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.140 align:middle line:84%
The root chakra is talking
to the physical world.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The solar plexus is talking
to the astral plane.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
The sacral is talking
to the emotional field.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:10%
>> While the intricate workings
of the chakras elude definitive

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:10%
scientific proof,
there are time-honored,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:10%
evidence-backed practices
that allow us to experience

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:10%
the transformative power of full
chakra activation first hand,

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:10%
offering a profound glimpse
into what it feels like to tap

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.072 align:middle line:10%
into our true potential.

00:18:54.072 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:10%
>> The chakras become activated
when you clear the energy

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:10%
of your emotional body,
when you clear the energy

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:06.080 align:middle line:10%
of your intellectual mind,
and when you align that

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.720 align:middle line:10%
to the cosmos, to
who you truly are.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Then you become the vessel--

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:90%
one could even say the channel--

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:90%
of bringing forth divine energy.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Balancing the chakras is
actually about spending time

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and awareness with each of
the areas of reality that

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:90%
our chakras manage.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So if we're trying to get
physically more healthy,

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.800 align:middle line:84%
spend some time with
your root chakra

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and meditate on the balance
of fire, air, earth,

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.520 align:middle line:90%
and water in your body.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Get to know how well
you're nourishing each

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:90%
of these aspects of your body.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, if you're
working on balancing

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
your stomach and your mind
and you want your solar plexus

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.700 align:middle line:84%
to be healthy, spend
some time looking

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:84%
at how you've created belief
systems in your mind that

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:90%
may not be serving you.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Simply by questioning
your own beliefs,

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.880 align:middle line:84%
opening up your
mental experience,

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and allowing yourself
to have a new belief

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.880 align:middle line:84%
structure about reality,
you can completely

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.200 align:middle line:84%
transform your belly
and your solar plexus.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, the
practice of developing

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.780 align:middle line:84%
our spiritual capacity
to accept ourselves

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:84%
at every single level
and whatever practices

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.970 align:middle line:84%
you do in order to
facilitate that,

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:33.590 align:middle line:84%
whether that's yoga, or Tai
Chi, or a martial arts form,

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.780 align:middle line:84%
getting to know each and
every layer of ourselves

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:84%
is the journey of
balancing the chakras,

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
but it's also the
journey of awakening

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:84%
our beings to the deeper
truth of all that is.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> For the full value
to be expressed,

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
we have to enliven all the
aspects of our physiology.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And the chakra
system is how we can

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.670 align:middle line:90%
enliven the different aspects.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Rather than going to this
organ, that organ, this cell,

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that cell, that small
tissue, that other tissue,

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:84%
they grouped them into those
centers of the whole area,

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:84%
like we have seen
with the pineal gland.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:22.860 align:middle line:10%
Centers are seen as the
confluence and the area

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:10%
where the entire system
can be managed from.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:10%
So when you put your attention
on the center of something,

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.340 align:middle line:10%
you are enlivening
the entire area.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So since our body is the
expression of total natural law,

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.850 align:middle line:84%
in order to live the
full potential of life,

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:45.662 align:middle line:84%
we have to enliven all
the areas of our life.

00:21:45.662 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Activating the full potential
of our chakras and alchemically

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:54.030 align:middle line:84%
transmuting what arises
in the process seems to be

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.570 align:middle line:84%
an inevitable part
of the human journey.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But what does this
inner technology

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:84%
reveal about our collective
evolution as a species?

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Through my own work with the
chakras and my own awakening

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:84%
process, I realized that
my body is holographically

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:84%
interconnected with the whole
universe from the smallest

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:23.600 align:middle line:84%
scales up to the largest, and
that when you simply follow

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:84%
the chain of scale through
each layer of the universe,

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:90%
all of it reveals itself.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that the nucleus
of an atom and the nucleus

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.630 align:middle line:84%
of a cell are actually both
related to the root chakra,

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and that the DNA and
the geometry of our DNA

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:46.100 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely related to our
heart and the organs in our body

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:84%
that interconnect
everything together,

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and is related to the spiral
of our galaxy that we're in.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:10%
So we're in this
incredible state

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:10%
of communion, what
I like to call

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:10%
the unified harmonic matrix.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're a part
of that symphony.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:90%
We're not isolated from it.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything at every
level is singing.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And our chakras can help us
balance and interpret that song

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:84%
so that we're playing
our instrument full out.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.410 align:middle line:10%
>> It's very important
to realize, I believe,

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:10%
we're at a phase of planetary
history where the veils between

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.300 align:middle line:10%
this reality and the next
reality are moving away.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And for those who
seek the light, who

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:84%
want to help humanity,
we are able, all of us,

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.500 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the
higher divine realities.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to connect
our seven chakras to our higher

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:84%
self, who have the insights
and the accompaniment

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:84%
of the angelic choir of angels
who are here to help us.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:90%
We are waking up.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:90%
We are understanding.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:90%
We are no longer alone.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're not just physical
beings at this time.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The chakras go
beyond the human body,

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:84%
stepping stones to the
universal body of light.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:10%
We are at an amazing time of
recognizing that the chakra

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:10%
system is a blueprint of a
multievolutionary process,

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.540 align:middle line:10%
through which we begin to
grasp we are, in essence,

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:31.662 align:middle line:10%
light beings in human form,
returning to the greater light.

00:24:31.662 --> 00:24:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> If the chakras are portals
through which we access

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:84%
the infinite, illuminating
our profound connection

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.900 align:middle line:84%
to the cosmos, then unlocking
their full potential

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:90%
doesn't merely help us evolve.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.455 align:middle line:84%
It redefines what it
means to be human.

00:24:48.455 --> 00:24:51.180 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for watching
Divine Science

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:10%
and exploring the
extraordinary connections that

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.200 align:middle line:10%
shape our existence.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:90%
