as well that is creating a
more parasympathetic system.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.240 align:middle line:10%
It's stimulating
the vagus nerve.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:10%
It's creating this
vibration inside.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:10%
It alters you.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:10%
Toning is a very powerful way
to shift consciousness and also

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.100 align:middle line:10%
bring in energy.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:10%
So when I'm toning, for
example, like for 15 minutes

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:10%
with certain divine
names or words of power,

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.060 align:middle line:10%
that could give
me the same effect

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:10%
like an hour-long
meditation in silence.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very powerful tool
to help shift us into a more

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.936 align:middle line:90%
heightened spiritual state.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:10%
>> When we speak about
the sounds of the Vedas,

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:17.340 align:middle line:10%
for example, the basic
importance is the silence

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.940 align:middle line:10%
in the sense that this is
what gives it structure--

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.470 align:middle line:10%
how much there is high and low
and where there is silence,

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:10%
where there is stopping between
different values of the sound

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:10%
otherwise it's a
continuous sound.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the structure
becomes important and giving

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.560 align:middle line:84%
the best effect
on the physiology

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:84%
through the
punctuation of silence.

[HUMMING]

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the silence
punctuating the sound,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
but it's like the sound
punctuating the silence.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
the transcendence,

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.950 align:middle line:84%
the field of all possibilities
is a field of silence.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Across the cosmos, from
the grand expanse of galaxies

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:84%
to the subtle resonance
of subatomic particles,

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:84%
sound is the fundamental
essence of existence.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:28.860 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:10%
>> I think the big takeaway
from the power of sound is that

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:10%
everything is vibration, and
everything in that vibration is

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:10%
all about the frequencies.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And we can use sound as a
way to very quickly shift

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:90%
our vibration.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you're ever
feeling low or in a sort

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:84%
of negative or down
state, if you just

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.330 align:middle line:84%
start working with the
right sounds and frequencies

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.670 align:middle line:84%
or your own toning
and voice, you

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:84%
can shift your frequency at
will to a much higher, more

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:84%
peaceful, more balanced,
and resonant state.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
powerful tool that we

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:84%
can use to shift
our state of being

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:84%
and elevate it to
a higher state.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I truly think sound is one
of the most profound parts

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:84%
of our experience
and our existence,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and yet few of us truly look at
the power it can have to change

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:90%
our lives.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:10%
It's very important
in this time that we

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.550 align:middle line:10%
get more in touch with the
nature of the gifts of sound

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:32.510 align:middle line:10%
and its capacity to
transform us, to heal us,

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.920 align:middle line:10%
and to make us better in
all the ways that we can be.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I hope that humanity will
recognize that we are a part

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
of a living vehicle of
attunement to the cosmic forces

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and laws of the universe which
operate through vibration.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I hope that we begin to
realize our thoughts are

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
like musical notes
and patterns that we

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
can orchestrate into patterns
of harmony and well-being.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:10%
And finally, I
believe that as we

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:10%
begin to use the sound
ciphers mathematically

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:10%
in decoding the ancient texts,
even like our Torah scriptures

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:10%
or Biblical scriptures or for
that matter of the Far East

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.810 align:middle line:10%
the Sutra texts, that we'll
be able to bring together

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.630 align:middle line:10%
a greater harmony between
science and spirituality.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.130 align:middle line:10%
And the meaning
of the two will be

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.040 align:middle line:10%
like alpha and omega, the
coming together of sound

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.820 align:middle line:10%
within and sound of the greater
attunement to the living

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:10%
universe.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Sound is sacred.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And we can use our own sounds
to help manifest reality

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.430 align:middle line:90%
with consciousness.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.750 align:middle line:10%
We can even use being
in silence and listening

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:10%
to the inner sounds as a
tool to tap into the divine.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.480 align:middle line:10%
There is a reason why the
ancient mystic masters

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.570 align:middle line:10%
have told impressions that
everything is vibration.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And the power of vibration
is they understand

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:84%
that sound is an aspect
of whatever creator being

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
or creator system
that you have it.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And if we resonate
and vibrate with this,

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:84%
it will enhance our
life, and it will

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:90%
make things a whole lot better.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we can work
with other people,

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:84%
we can create a cooperative,
compassionate planet

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.010 align:middle line:90%
that will be heaven on Earth.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:90%

>> As the distinction between
scientific research and ancient

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
wisdom becomes
increasingly intertwined,

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.250 align:middle line:84%
the power of sound emerges
as a profound mediator,

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:84%
bridging these realms and
echoing the unseen threads that

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:48.205 align:middle line:90%
