He can erase computer
tapes with his mind.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I did experiments
with floppy disks

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:84%
where I put my hand
over the floppy disk,

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:84%
because there were
floppy disks then,

That is even those who
practice irregularly.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:10%
And when we looked at those
who practiced twice a day

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:10%

Now, you can pick however you'd
like to send your intention.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:10%
You could send the intention
to be that the water becomes

we're going to rerun
the EIS machine

or through looking at your own

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.310 align:middle line:84%
life, there are new
possibilities that open up.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.920 align:middle line:84%
One of which is called
subtle activism.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
yourself and groups

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:84%
of other people in
some coordinated way

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.890 align:middle line:84%
in your community or around
the world get together,

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and they have coherent thoughts,
maybe coherent thoughts

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:84%
with an intention, for
example, world peace

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.900 align:middle line:84%
or nuclear de-escalation
or the reduction of crime

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:18.100 align:middle line:84%
or the healing of
somebody who's sick.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So there does seem to be
something to this idea

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
collective consciousness

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and that the introduction
of coherent thinking

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.590 align:middle line:84%
of coherent and
pointed consciousness

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%

>> Further evidence suggesting
the impact of thoughts

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.940 align:middle line:10%
and emotions on the physical
world comes from the Japanese

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:10%
alternative medicine
practitioner Dr. Masaru Emoto.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:10%
In the late 1990s,
Emoto's experiments

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:10%
involved photographing
water crystals that

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:10%
were exposed to a range
of emotional stimuli

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:10%
from positive to
negative thoughts.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:10%
His work suggests that these
emotions could materially

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:10%
affect the water's crystalline
structure, thus raising

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.430 align:middle line:10%
a significant implication.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.450 align:middle line:84%
If our thoughts can affect the
quality of water externally,

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:84%
does that suggest
that our thoughts

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.520 align:middle line:84%
can affect the state
of our bodies, which

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:90%
are approximately 60% water?

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Where the positive emotions
like love and gratitude were

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:10%
transmitted to the water, it
formed beautiful symmetric

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:10%
water crystals that look
kind of like snowflakes,

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.490 align:middle line:10%
but they were
slightly different.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And then there was the ones
where it was negative energy,

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:90%
like hate or anger.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.610 align:middle line:90%
It was distorted.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:84%
It didn't form a
beautiful pattern

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.550 align:middle line:84%
of symmetry, which most water
crystals would naturally

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:90%
form symmetry.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:84%
But it was very clear that
there was toxicity put into it

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:56.850 align:middle line:84%
by our human emotion or thought
that was given to that water.

your state of strength, or
any aspect of your body,

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:84%
it simply requires changing
the level of thinking

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%

doing with your own body.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Many of us send our bodies
judgments all the time.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.190 align:middle line:84%
We condition our bodies by
giving ourselves hard feedback,

telling ourselves the things we
should be or should do better.

that we are strong, that we
are good people, that we are

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:84%

demonstrating the influence

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.470 align:middle line:84%
of thoughts on healing and
well-being is the phenomenon

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:90%
of the placebo effect.

really great example of how

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts can
affect our outcome.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the typical
example is that they're

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
running a clinical trial upon
a particular new medicine

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:90%
or drug.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And they give certain group
of people that new medicine,

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and then they have
a control group

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:90%
of people who get a sugar pill.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:10%
And the group that's
getting the actual medicine

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:10%
needs to show that there's
an effect that is greater

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:10%
than the placebo effect.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And the placebo effect
shows that basically

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.150 align:middle line:84%
about half the people
who got the sugar pill

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.820 align:middle line:84%
believed that they were
getting the actual pill

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.010 align:middle line:90%
and their conditions improved.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The placebo
effect is massive.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Everyone agrees that
it's massive, right?

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
mind-matter interaction

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
experiments, you start to
see how you can maybe provide

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.700 align:middle line:90%
an explanation for this.

into your body, maybe affecting
the water in your body, which

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:84%
in turn affects the balance
of signaling solutions

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.290 align:middle line:84%

driving outcomes ultimately

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.060 align:middle line:84%

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:84%

that the power's in your hands,

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:84%
that you get to step into the

So how you hold others in

The way you think about them can
actually affect how they feel

and what's going
on inside of them.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.950 align:middle line:84%
We are more telepathic
than we imagine.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And with telepathy
comes telekinesis,

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and this is a power
that we must learn how

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.330 align:middle line:84%
to harness very
