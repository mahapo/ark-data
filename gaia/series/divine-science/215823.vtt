00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The pineal gland is the point
of departure where the ancient

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.810 align:middle line:90%
and the future come together.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's connected with
receiving information,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.620 align:middle line:84%
not just from what our eyes see,
but what our third eye is able

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:90%
to grasp.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a super organ that we
believe is a key to the fifth

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:90%
dimension.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been some fascinating
work done on the pineal gland

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and ESP or psychic abilities,
things like poltergeist activity

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:84%
or psychokinesis, mind
affecting physical matter.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The pineal is allowing us to
pull information from the field,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and the field is where
our divinity begins.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Until we grasp the
power of the pineal gland,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:84%
we're still in the
world of darkness.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:84%
We have not seen the
light within the light,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.527 align:middle line:84%
the bioluminescence
within ourselves,

00:01:07.527 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:90%
that is the light of the future.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Where ancient wisdom and
modern research converge,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.813 align:middle line:10%
divine science emerges.

00:01:17.813 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.100 align:middle line:10%
Deep within the brain lies a
tiny pine cone-shaped organ--

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:10%
the pineal gland.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Located between the
two hemispheres,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:84%
it regulates sleep
through melatonin,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:84%
but its significance may
go far beyond biology.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Revered throughout
history as the third eye,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:84%
it's been linked to intuition
and spiritual perception.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Could this small
gland be a gateway

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:84%
to hidden realms
of consciousness?

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:10%
>> The pineal gland was
called the seat of the soul

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:10%
by Descartes-- and he believed
that it was the connection

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:10%
between the body and the soul.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:10%
So that was one
modern description

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:10%
of the spiritual nature
of the pineal gland.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:10%
Vedic spirituality
calls it the cave

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.470 align:middle line:10%
of Brahma, which is the central
location of the brain that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:10%
connects us to our
infinite nature.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.120 align:middle line:10%
>> So when this part of the
physiology is found to be

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:10%
so central in the brain, then
it already immediately has been

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:10%
felt that it must have some
importance in psychology,

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:10%
in reality.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And the other part is because
it connects to the visual system

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.460 align:middle line:90%
where the light comes from.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And light and enlightenment
and being able to see things

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And so you can see things
from a deeper perspective.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.600 align:middle line:84%
So it was assumed that
it is the third eye.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Beyond its spiritual
legacy and role in regulating

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
biological rhythms, emerging
evidence suggests the pineal

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
gland may act as
a biotransducer,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:84%
converting subtle forms
of energy into electrical

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.633 align:middle line:90%
or biochemical signals.

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>> In recent years, scientists
have made new discoveries

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
showing that the pineal gland
is more than simply specialized

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:90%
tissue in the human body.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:10%
There's a crystalline
component to the pineal gland.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:10%
The crystalline substance now
that is found in the pineal

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:10%
naturally is a form of calcite.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:10%
>> And it is a form of calcite
that forms in a geometry

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:10%
that's called the rhombohedron.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:84%
The geometry of a crystalline
substance in this gland

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:84%
is of deep significance because
that crystalline substance also

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
can be a piezoelectric
substance.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is, under
certain conditions of pressure,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
the pressure can be
a biological pressure

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:84%
from the cerebrospinal fluid
in the body being manipulated

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:84%
in ways that can be learned
and can be mastered.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.025 align:middle line:84%
Pushing that fluid up against
the crystalline structure that,

00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:84%
that crystalline
substance actually

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
emits a trickle
charge of electricity.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:10%
An electrical charge form
pressure within the human body.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of activating the
pineal gland through inner

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:90%
practices is ancient.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:10%
Hindu and Tibetan tantra,
along with Egyptian alchemy,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.690 align:middle line:10%
describes circulating
life force energy

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:10%
to awaken heightened
states of awareness.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.990 align:middle line:84%
This indicates that the
pineal gland is more than just

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:90%
a biological organ.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a
sophisticated system--

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:90%
an internal technology.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>> If we start to think about
the human body in terms of IT,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Information Technology, we
already know that all the cells

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
produce electrical charge,
transistors, resistors,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.150 align:middle line:84%
capacitors, photon emitters,
photon receivers, we know that.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland plays a role
here because it is a transducer.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:84%
It transduces information
from the field

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.960 align:middle line:84%
beyond the body into images that
we can now see within the body.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It appears that the pineal
gland, when activated properly,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to be super
sensitive to receiving

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:90%
information from any direction.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:10%
It operates as a bioantenna
for the human system, whereby

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:10%
we become transducers
or we call it

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:10%
biocomputers of great
ability, great sensitivity,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:10%
and great memory.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Essentially, the third eye
was thus seen historically

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle line:84%
in mystical literature,
in particular,

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:84%
is that part of the eye that
can see through space and time,

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:84%
connect with so-called higher
cosmic entities or realities,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and also provide the ability
of paranormal assessment

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:84%
or detailed workings
of the universe.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>> If the pineal gland functions
as a bioantenna capable

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
of accessing information
beyond the senses,

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
then it may play a key role
in how we visualize, heal,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:90%
and transform.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Neuroscience shows that the
brain responds powerfully

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.390 align:middle line:84%
not only to action, but also
to observation and imagination.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:84%
In 1992, Italian neuroscientists
discovered mirror neurons.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.940 align:middle line:84%
These special types
of neurons fire

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:84%
in the exact same
way when we perform

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:84%
an action as when another
person performs the same action.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's a series of
studies that were done,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.780 align:middle line:10%
fascinating studies where they
scanned the brain top, bottom,

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.810 align:middle line:10%
left, and right of an individual
going through the motions

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:10%
of reaching for
a glass of water.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So the first scan,
the individual

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.040 align:middle line:90%
is reaching for the water.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Certain parts of the brain
light up completely expected.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.210 align:middle line:90%
No surprises.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:84%
The second scan is someone
watching an individual reaching.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.890 align:middle line:84%
They're not doing the reaching,
they are watching someone else

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
reaching, and the same parts
of their brain are lighting up.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:90%
The third scan tells the story.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:84%
The third scan, that
individual is not reaching--

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:84%
is not watching
someone else reach.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:84%
That individual is
imagining themselves

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
reach for that water in the
same parts of the brain.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.650 align:middle line:84%
To a little lesser degree,
the same parts of the brain

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:90%
are lighting up.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>> When we see ourselves
consciously choose to see

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
ourselves as healed
in our mind's eye,

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.618 align:middle line:84%
the body begins to respond
to what those mirror neurons,

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
the signals that
they're sending out.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And the body says,
oh, I'm healed.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So I must produce the chemistry
to facilitate the healing

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:90%
that I'm seeing in this image.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
The pineal is allowing us to
pull information from the field,

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and the field is where
our divinity begins.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:84%
When the pineal transduces
the energy of that healing

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:84%
into the images in our
mind, then the mirror neuron

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:90%
then can see those images.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:37.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a highly advanced,
technologically sophisticated

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:84%
soft technology of
self-regulation.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:84%
No other form of life
that we know of today

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to do what
I'm describing right now.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The pineal gland holds
mysteries that science is only

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:90%
beginning to uncover.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Could this ancient third eye be
influenced not only by energy,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:90%
but by light itself?

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Raising questions about its role
in both biology and awakening.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> What's fascinating about the
pineal gland is that we now know

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:84%
it has these
photoreceptors in it.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So it can actually, this gland,
deep in the center of the brain,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
pick up light, and senses
light, which is so fascinating.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:10%
And this is well
known, documented fact

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.550 align:middle line:10%
in the mainstream
scientific community.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And we wonder why?

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, maybe it's this regulation
of the waking and sleeping

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:84%
piece, but is that connected
to the spiritual light tethered

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:84%
between the crown chakra
and the third eye?

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Does it pick up on the
spiritual light inspiring

00:09:55.250 --> 00:10:02.210 align:middle line:84%
our spiritual awakening, as
well as our physical awakening?

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Like the eye, the
pineal gland, when split,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.120 align:middle line:90%
exhibits rods and cones.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Like axons and
dendrites connected

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
with the neurological
layerings of the inner brain,

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland has, as it
were, a conical shape which

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
allows a type of spiral
dynamic, allowing the mind--

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:84%
now this is all theoretical,
to somehow reach

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:84%
higher planes of resonance
or higher levels of what

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:84%
would be called, in Eastern
science, higher chakra levels.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If the pineal gland is
equated to the Ajna chakra--

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:84%
the sixth chakra
of the body, it's

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.340 align:middle line:84%
connected with
receiving information

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
not just from what
our eyes see, but what

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.050 align:middle line:90%
our third eye is able to grasp.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.910 align:middle line:10%
So we look at it
with light energy--

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.830 align:middle line:10%
the normal Einsteinian light.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.900 align:middle line:10%
But we also have to realize
the pineal gland is connected

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:10%
with the cosmic light.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:84%
We would call in
the Hebrew structure

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.790 align:middle line:84%
the EIn Sof, the limitless, that
energy that comes forth and is

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.410 align:middle line:84%
part of us, that gives us
insights beyond anything

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:90%
that we've ever had before.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.580 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The pineal gland has long
been associated with altered

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:90%
states of awareness.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.490 align:middle line:10%
Scientific inquiry has
explored its potential role

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:10%
in producing DMT,
dimethyltryptamine, a powerful,

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:10%
naturally occurring compound
linked to visionary experience

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.430 align:middle line:10%
and exalted states
of consciousness.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The production of DMT from
the pineal is a little bit more

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:90%
mysterious.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Two primary times in our
lives when our body naturally

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:90%
kicks up higher levels of DMT.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:84%
First, those is when we
come into this world coming

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:84%
through the birth
canal, our body

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:84%
begins to produce higher
levels of DMT and perhaps

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:84%
not surprisingly, on the
other end of our lives,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.220 align:middle line:84%
when we leave this world
at the time of death.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Just before death, the
body will begin producing

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.040 align:middle line:90%
a higher level of DMT.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
DMT is often associated with
hallucinogenic properties.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And the big question in
the scientific community,

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
does the DMT alter our
perception chemically

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.910 align:middle line:84%
showing us something
that doesn't exist?

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Or does it open a doorway to
a deeper level of perception,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
allowing us insights
into a reality

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're typically
not accustomed to

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's something
that does exist?

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether DMT fabricates
experience or reveals a deeper

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:84%
layer of perception echoes
descriptions found in ancient

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.820 align:middle line:90%
spiritual texts.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
In yogic traditions,
the state of samadhi

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
is seen as a direct
encounter with pure awareness

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
beyond the boundaries
of the physical self.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>> If you take DMT, you are
blasted into this incredible

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.530 align:middle line:90%
transcendent samadhi state.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And some people believe that
the pineal gland actually

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.810 align:middle line:84%
is the manufacturer of
this DMT within the body.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't have definitive
proof of that yet.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:10%
We actually have
not been able to see

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.480 align:middle line:10%
DMT in a human pineal
gland, although it has

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:10%
been shown in animal models.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet, perhaps there
is some connection

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.660 align:middle line:84%
to this molecule
that can take humans

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:84%
beyond their physical bodies
into this transcendent oneness

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:43.300 align:middle line:10%
>> While DMT may point to
one layer of its function,

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:10%
the pineal gland seems to
operate on a far more complex

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:10%
level, not just as a
portal to altered states,

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:10%
but as a key integrator
of perception, cognition,

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness itself.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The pineal gland is part
of that regulatory mechanism,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.985 align:middle line:84%
like a thermostat in a room
that if we learn to work with,

00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:90%
with greater depth.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And greater meditative
skills allows us to receive,

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.970 align:middle line:84%
as it were, the drama of being
able to see a larger perceptual

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:90%
field of activity.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
In essence, harness the left
and the right side of the brain.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:84%
The left being the
analytical, the right

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:84%
being the multidimensional
metaphysical.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.300 align:middle line:84%
These two areas have
been generally separated.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:84%
By the way, we are educated
in Western science.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:84%
However, studies being done
in Stanford Research Institute

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:84%
in the 1970s with yogis and
people having unique mental

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.600 align:middle line:84%
abilities shows that both
sides of the brain uniquely are

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
mobilized through
the pineal gland.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:10%
So the pineal gland
operates, as it

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.180 align:middle line:10%
were, a leverage of being able
to get the mind of the human

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:10%
to think in color, to
think in sacred geometry,

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:10%
and also under some
unique conditions,

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:09.270 align:middle line:10%
to think with a type of
paraphysical power of mind

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:10%
extension, whereby
we are able to extend

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.710 align:middle line:10%
the vibratory visual process
into other dimensions,

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.680 align:middle line:10%
gather information,
and come back

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:10%
into the human processing
of normal logic.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> If the pineal gland helps
engage both hemispheres

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.650 align:middle line:84%
of the brain during
expanded states,

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.860 align:middle line:84%
could other specialized
structures also support this

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:90%
process?

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Some suggest that deeper neural
regions may work in concert

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
with the pineal to help
access non-ordinary

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:10%
>> An interesting fact that's
now coming forward is the fact

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.850 align:middle line:10%
that in our brains, we have
something called the dorsal

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:10%
striatum.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:10%
Now in that are two
parts of the brain.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:84%
One is called the
putamen and the other

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.290 align:middle line:90%
is called the caudate nucleus.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Those have been
seen to be augmented

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:84%
in people that have a
cosmic awareness that

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.400 align:middle line:84%
can remote view, that can
go beyond the normality.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
part of the brain,

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
which is both on the right
and the left hemisphere,

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:84%
can coordinate with the pineal
gland as a type of antenna

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and activation vibration
to open the pineal gland

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.220 align:middle line:90%
to cosmic dimensions.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> According to
declassified CIA reports,

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.860 align:middle line:84%
very special sensitives using
the third eye have been able

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.760 align:middle line:84%
to pick up on paranormal
events at great distances.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
In our research, the
Academy for Future Science

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.390 align:middle line:84%
has been able to work
with gifted scientists

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:84%
like Dr. Elizabeth Rauscher in
demonstrating the pineal gland

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:84%
is essentially part of
the cosmic bioantenna

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:84%
system connecting the top of
the head with the pineal gland,

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.260 align:middle line:84%
with the sensory systems
that we have at our disposal

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
to see distant events,
analyze distant events,

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and record distance events
without the use of technology.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.400 align:middle line:84%
It is a super organ
that we believe

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:90%
is a key to the fifth dimension.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>> As science explores the
pineal role beyond the sensory

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:84%
world, researchers are
uncovering how it may interact

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.050 align:middle line:84%
with subtle
environmental forces,

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:84%
including Earth's
magnetic field.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Could this link help explain
shifts in perception, awareness,

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and even psychic sensitivity?

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been some fascinating
work done on the pineal gland

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:90%
and ESP or psychic abilities.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.360 align:middle line:84%
There's this unique
aspect to the pineal gland

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
in that not only does it sense
light, but it sends magnetism.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And there is this
interesting relationship

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:84%
between geomagnetism
and psychic abilities.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Geomagnetism, we
receive from the sun,

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:84%
from the various
solar rays of the sun,

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and it affects the Earth and
affects our human bodies.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.700 align:middle line:84%
There have been
relationships between days

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:84%
of high geomagnetic activity
and increased expressive

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:90%
psychic abilities.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Things like poltergeist
activity or psychokinesis,

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:84%
mind affecting the
physical matter.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And then on low
geomagnetic days,

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.920 align:middle line:84%
there is an increase in
receptive psychic abilities

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:84%
like clairvoyance or
telepathy precognition.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
interesting dynamic

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
between these high and
low geomagnetic days.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:10%
And the pineal gland has
these magnetic receptors

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.680 align:middle line:10%
to be able to perceive that.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:10%
So perhaps, there is this
connection between geomagnetism

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.010 align:middle line:10%
and the pineal gland
in our expression

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:10%
of these psychic abilities.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.980 align:middle line:10%
>> While outer forces like
geomagnetism may influence

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:10%
the pineal gland, ancient
traditions have long pointed

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.140 align:middle line:10%
inward.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:10%
Emerging research is
beginning to confirm

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:10%
that specific
inner practices can

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:10%
stimulate pineal activity
in ways that balance biology

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.320 align:middle line:10%
and expand conscious awareness.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We have done studies that
show that during the practice

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.100 align:middle line:84%
of transcending, there
is actually a secretion

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:90%
of melatonin.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
That is a very unusual
combination of situation.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:10%
So being very restful and calm
and yet being awake inside.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:10%
So activating, if you
like, the third eye, that's

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:10%
what we're calling
awake within, we also

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:10%
know that people who practice
transcendental meditation

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:10%
are able to overcome
sleep problems.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:10%
So people who have
insomnia, when

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:10%
they start transcendental
meditation,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:10%
their sleep patterns
are improved,

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:10%
they fall asleep easier,
and they have better

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.530 align:middle line:10%
sleep during the night.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that
is also influencing

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
the health and balance of
the pineal gland functioning.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So the most common
processes that people suggest

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:84%
for activation of the pineal
gland is mostly through

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.380 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Others suggest not a yoga,
which is sound vibration,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:84%
or for a long time,
no one understood

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:84%
that sound vibration
had anything to do

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.560 align:middle line:90%
with our atomic structure.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:90%
This is now changed.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:10%
What Cornell University
has now analyzed

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:10%
is that the right
phonon vibrations,

00:20:55.580 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:10%
this is sound vibrations can
literally activate and excite

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:10%
the electrons of atoms.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And our whole body
is made up of atoms.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you're trying to
activate the pineal gland,

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:84%
the right sound
vibrations, and I also

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:84%
want to add the right
thought form vibrations allow

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:90%
you to align to the light.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What the science is showing
really clearly is the most

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.670 align:middle line:84%
powerful component, the
most powerful environment.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not from the
world outside of us.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the emotional environment
that we create within us.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It's the way that we feel about
ourselves, our relationship

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:90%
It's our story.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.040 align:middle line:84%
We live our lives
based upon the way

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
we've been taught to
think about ourselves.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think probably the
highest level of mastery

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:84%
is to unplug from the false
sense of being flawed victims

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.650 align:middle line:84%
of a world that we
have no control over,

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that we are
so much more than we've

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:90%
been led to believe.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And we are highly advanced,
technologically sophisticated

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:90%
soft technology.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland is one of
the most important parts

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:16.430 align:middle line:84%
of that because it is the
transducer bringing information

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:84%
from another world, and that the
brain sees the body responds to.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So our highest level of mastery
is to honor and preserve

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.800 align:middle line:90%
the gift of our bodies.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The ability to translate
energy into meaning is what

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.430 align:middle line:84%
makes the pineal gland
so central to this inner

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:84%
technology, connecting
perception, insight,

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and the deeper dimensions
of human experience.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The power of the pineal gland
to bring information into this

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
world in meaningful ways in
visual images that we can

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.390 align:middle line:84%
assimilate and act upon,
that we're only beginning

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:54.980 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.410 align:middle line:84%
We've asked science
to tell us who we are

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:90%
and what our potential is.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Science is doing
a really good job.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.320 align:middle line:84%
The question is, do
we love ourselves

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.850 align:middle line:84%
enough to follow
the information?

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.950 align:middle line:10%
Or will we fall into the trap
of forcing that information

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.890 align:middle line:10%
into the old ideas that
keep us stuck and limited

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:10%
in the ways that we think
of ourselves and the world?

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to realize
that we are cosmic beings.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:10%
And when we open
the pineal gland,

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.770 align:middle line:10%
literally activating
the sixth chakra,

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:10%
we can discover
our cosmic identity

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.120 align:middle line:10%
as being not just the flesh
and blood bodies that we are,

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.750 align:middle line:10%
but the cosmic
dimensions of reality

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.330 align:middle line:10%
that we can participate in.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The future roadmap is the
understanding of the full

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:90%
potential of the pineal gland.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland is
the point of departure

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.540 align:middle line:84%
where the ancient and the
future come together even

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetime.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.330 align:middle line:10%
Until we grasp the
power and the exposition

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.680 align:middle line:10%
of that power of
the pineal gland,

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.390 align:middle line:10%
we're still in the
world of darkness.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.310 align:middle line:84%
We have not seen
the bioluminescence

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves, that is
the light of the future.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The brain is a magnificent
tool that we have as humans.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.670 align:middle line:10%
So I would invite you
to engage in a dialogue

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.520 align:middle line:10%
with your own brain, with
your own pineal gland,

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:10%
and explore this
area of your brain--

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.120 align:middle line:10%
whatever practice you
engage in, and see

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:10%
what it has to reveal to you.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether regulating our
circadian rhythms or unlocking

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.300 align:middle line:84%
access to expanded
states of awareness,

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.760 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland may hold the
key to deeper dimensions of who

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.010 align:middle line:90%
we are and who we are becoming.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:84%
The question is no
longer just what it does,

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.500 align:middle line:84%
but what are we truly ready
to perceive through it?

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.710 align:middle line:10%
Join us for more episodes
on Divine Science,

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:10%
where we continue exploring the
crossroads of modern research

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:10%
and ancient wisdom.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:90%
