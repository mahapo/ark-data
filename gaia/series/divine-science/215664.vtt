in control?

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:10%
For centuries, Tibetan
monks and Indigenous shamans

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:10%
have explored lucid
dreaming as a gateway

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.920 align:middle line:10%
to self-discovery
and a transformation,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.140 align:middle line:10%
harnessing its power

But what exactly
is a lucid dream?

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lucid dream is a
dream where you know that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:84%
you're dreaming as the
dream is happening.

dream, where within the dream,

you have the experience of
going, oh, wow, I'm in a dream

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:10%
right now, I can choose what
to do, that's a lucid dream.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.292 align:middle line:10%
So it's not just a
really vivid dream.

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:10%
It's not a dream that
you remember really

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.150 align:middle line:10%
well in the morning.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:84%
It's specifically a dream
where within the dream itself,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:84%
you have the reactivation of
self-reflective awareness,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
allowing you to go, oh, wow,
I'm in a dream as I'm dreaming.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> There are different
levels of lucidity.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
had this before,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.830 align:middle line:90%
but you can have a drunkenness.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
You kind of know
you're dreaming,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:90%
but you feel a bit drunk.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And you just still go
along with the flow,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.740 align:middle line:84%
but in the back of mind,
you know you're dreaming.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.907 align:middle line:10%
And if you've ever had a
nightmare where you've got,

00:02:16.907 --> 00:02:19.360 align:middle line:10%
oh, I've got to wake up,
you're actually lucid,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:10%
but you haven't got that
control of someone who's maybe

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:10%
a bit further along the line.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the
next step, which

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, I'm in the
deepest recess of my mind.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:90%
I could create worlds.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.260 align:middle line:84%
I could go through the
floor into the solar system.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's this wider awareness
of control beyond the confines

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:90%
of the ordinary world.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And then the last one
is you've got God mode.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you can
collapse the dream state

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and see what's beyond the dream,
where you can completely change

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
it into whatever you want
so that when you wake up,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
that can affect what you
then bring into your life.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's the God mode.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So you can go from
drunk to God mode.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>> As lucidity deepens, dreamers
gain increasing control,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
transforming their surroundings,
shaping entire worlds.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:84%
But what is happening in the
brain when this shift occurs?

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.390 align:middle line:10%
Could the science
of neuroplasticity

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:10%
reveal how lucid dreams
reshape not just the dream

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:10%
world but the mind itself?

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Neuroplasticity is the
ability of the brain to change

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:10%
its structure according to
experience and learning.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.440 align:middle line:10%
So literally, the connections
between the neurons

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:10%
change with experience.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful part
about lucid dreaming

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
is because the prefrontal
cortex comes online,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.360 align:middle line:84%
this brings
neuroplasticity online

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:90%
and you can learn in the dream.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
This has been shown with
skateboarding, extreme sports.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So lucid dreamers
will use this state

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.200 align:middle line:84%
to practice things
that would be very

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
dangerous to try in real life
and get better and better at it.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually
rewiring their brain.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Neuroplasticity, the
easiest way I can explain it is

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:84%
by folding this piece of
paper up several times.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now I unfold
the piece of paper.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.709 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I fold it
again, much quicker.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Two reasons.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the folds
are already there.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And number two, I've
already done it before.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So neuroplasticity
is about repeating

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
certain actions that
lead to neural grooves

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:90%
in the network of our brain.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So the more you do
a certain activity

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.920 align:middle line:84%
or the more you
think a certain way,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.540 align:middle line:84%
the deeper the grooves in the
neural network of your brain

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:90%
become.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the
neurobiological basis of habit.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The more you do
something, the more neural

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
pathways you have
associated with that action.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.965 align:middle line:84%
How does that apply
to lucid dreaming?

00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:06.960 align:middle line:84%
In non-lucid dreams,
neuroplasticity is not engaged.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:84%
But once you become lucid
and the prefrontal cortex

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
reactivates, which is the
neurological basis of lucidity,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
neuroplasticity
comes back online.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So this means that whatever you
do in your lucid dreams actually

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
lays down neural
pathways in the brain

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
in exactly the same way as it
would do in the waking state.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It means you can learn
in your lucid dreams.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:84%
It means you can get better
at stuff in your lucid dreams.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And it means we can make
audacious statements like,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:84%
lucid dreaming allows you to
rewire your brain while you

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
sleep, and for that
audacious statement

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:90%
to be scientifically true.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.690 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> In a typical dream, the
prefrontal cortex is inactive,

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:84%
leaving us to drift through
dreamscapes without questioning

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%
But in a lucid dream, this
part of the brain reactivates,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.400 align:middle line:84%
restoring agency, the ability
to recognize and control one's

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:90%
actions within the dream.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But does the brain recognize
the difference between dreaming

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:90%
and wakefulness?

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as the brain is
concerned, you're awake.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Although the mind
knows that you're

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
dreaming, by its nature
of defining lucidity,

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:84%
the brain thinks you're awake
because from the brain's

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:84%
point of view, and this is an
interesting philosophical point,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:84%
wakefulness is not predicated
on having your eyes open

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.550 align:middle line:90%
and walking around the daytime.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Wakefulness is predicated on
prefrontal cortex activation.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So once that part of
the brain is activated,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.070 align:middle line:84%
the brain thinks you're
awake and so will

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:84%
start to lay down neural
pathways in exactly the same way

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.830 align:middle line:90%
as if you were actually awake.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the brain
perceives lucid dreams

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:84%
as if the experience were real,
practicing within this state can

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:84%
have measurable effects on
behavior, skill development,

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:90%
and even physical performance.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Studies suggest that rehearsing
actions in a lucid dream

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:84%
strengthens neural pathways,
reinforcing habits,

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and improving
real-world abilities.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason why lucid dreaming
is so profoundly beneficial

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:84%
for new habits and new behaviors
is because you can practice

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and rehearse things in
the dream state itself.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.858 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're a bit
anxious with talking to guys

00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:22.900 align:middle line:84%
or talking to girls, and
you want to go on a date

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:84%
or you want to try
and find a partner,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:84%
you could get into
the lucid dream

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and you could say, my
ideal partner, come to me,

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and you can practice
talking to them.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And then because your brain
thinks it's really happening,

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.170 align:middle line:84%
it will build this neural
pathway in your brain.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So you'll be able to-- when
you come back into real life,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.440 align:middle line:84%
into the ordinary state,
it's like you've actually

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.760 align:middle line:90%
done the work.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So then when you
enter a situation,

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
you're more likely to
have the confidence

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and more likely to
have the capability

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:84%
to have that conversation
and say those things

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and have less anxiety
than you actually would

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:84%
because you've practiced
in the dream state.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:84%
You can also train habits
in the lucid dream,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and it will have
a direct correlate

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to improving and getting
better in the waking state.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
They did this study,
where they did squats

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.040 align:middle line:90%
in the lucid dream state.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And when they came out
of it in real life,

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.640 align:middle line:90%
they got better at squats.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Not only psychologically,
but also their muscle mass

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:90%
increased a little bit.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I was part of one of the
studies that they did with

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:90%
martial artists.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
We had to practice
a certain kick

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.070 align:middle line:84%
sequence in the
waking state, then

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:90%
go into the lucid dream state.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, why?

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm dreaming.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.218 align:middle line:90%
What did I want to do?

00:08:34.218 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I wanted to practice
that kick sequence

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.218 align:middle line:90%
that I'm doing for the study.

00:08:37.218 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:84%
So you remember your
intention and then

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:90%
you engage the kick sequence.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Then in the waking
state, they see,

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:84%
did you get better,
worse, or stay the same?

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:84%
In that study, 81.3%
of martial artists

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
reported getting better in
their waking state performance

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:84%
after training in
the lucid dream.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is really
nice if you're an artist

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:90%
or you're a creative.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
You could say to
the dream state,

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:84%
show me the most beautiful
piece of music I can create.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And your unconscious mind
will send back to you

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:90%
whatever music that is.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.850 align:middle line:84%
You can say, show
me the best painting

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that I have the
potential to create.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And then it shows you
this beautiful artwork.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in the lucid
dream and we rehearse

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
in these new behaviors, these
new habits, these new skills,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.440 align:middle line:84%
when we go into the waking
state, we're better at them.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:10%
Because when we're in the dream,
we are developing and plowing

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.750 align:middle line:10%
those neural pathways that
help us create those behaviors.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And this directly correlates
with getting better at them

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:90%
in the waking state.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Lucid dreaming is not only
a tool for skill development

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:90%
and creativity.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that becoming
lucid within nightmares

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
allows individuals to reframe
distressing experiences,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:90%
reducing their emotional impact.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But could this ability
extend beyond nightmares?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Researchers are exploring
whether the healing that

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:84%
takes place within a lucid dream
can reshape trauma responses

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.540 align:middle line:90%
in waking life.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So we did two studies with
veterans and other folks with

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.580 align:middle line:84%
PTSD to bring them into
a workshop setting.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And the first study
was a pilot study

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:84%
with 50 people
experiencing chronic PTSD.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Through the week
with Charlie, they

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.800 align:middle line:84%
learned about dreaming,
lucid dreaming,

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:90%
and they developed a dream plan.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
They were going to access
their subconscious mind

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:90%
and transform their trauma.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Most people had no
experience of lucid dreaming,

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:10%
although a few had.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:10%
And my job was to spend one week
teaching them how to lucid dream

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:10%
and specifically how to use
their lucid dreams to face

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:10%
their fears and to
transform their traumas.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, let's say I
become lucid in a recurring

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:84%
nightmare that I'm back
in Iraq, like a lot

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.860 align:middle line:84%
of the military veterans
I work with might have.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And in this recurring
nightmare, you become lucid.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And you know, oh, I'm
not really back in Iraq.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm just dreaming
I'm back in Iraq.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So because this is a dream,
I can change the ending.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So now I can change the ending
of the traumatic memory,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
nightmare to a non-traumatic
ending, or in fact,

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.270 align:middle line:84%
allow the nightmare to play
out traumatically but not

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:84%
be traumatized by it because
you know that it's not real.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you do that, as far
as the brain is concerned,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:84%
you didn't dream about having
that experience in Iraq,

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
as far as the
brain is concerned,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.650 align:middle line:84%
last night, you
were back in Iraq

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:84%
and you had a very
similar experience,

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.330 align:middle line:84%
but this time, it
was non-traumatic.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Then the brain will
restore that new memory,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.720 align:middle line:84%
the non-traumatic one, in place
of the old traumatic memory.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that's the
biological underpinning

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
of how trauma integration
in lucid dreaming occurs.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>> By rewriting the nightmare
from a place of awareness,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.180 align:middle line:84%
the brain encodes the
new non-traumatic version

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:84%
as reality, replacing the
old memory and reducing its

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:90%
emotional charge.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Recent clinical studies
reveal the powerful impact

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.270 align:middle line:84%
of this process
on PTSD recovery.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What we found
was within one week,

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.930 align:middle line:84%
using lucid dreaming alone, the
vast majority of participants

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:84%
had such a steep decrease in
their post-traumatic stress

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
disorder symptoms that they were
no longer classified as having

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:90%
PTSD.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So by the end of the week,
85% of those 55 participants

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.180 align:middle line:84%
were no longer classified
medically as having PTSD.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And one month later,
they were still

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.913 align:middle line:84%
classified as
being free of PTSD.

00:12:38.913 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>> During the
period of the study,

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.060 align:middle line:84%
where we're measuring things,
we had these two groups

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:90%
in parallel.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.190 align:middle line:90%
All of them come in with PTSD.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So then the active group
goes through the workshop

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:90%
with Charlie Morley.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.568 align:middle line:84%
We measure, make them answer
questionnaires every morning.

00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:57.860 align:middle line:90%
They talk about their lucidity.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:84%
They talk about their
level of trauma.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.800 align:middle line:84%
They talk about
their nightmares.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you the results now.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:90%
They were wonderful.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.080 align:middle line:84%
The folks that went through
the workshop came out,

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.800 align:middle line:84%
their PTSD symptoms
drastically reduced

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.400 align:middle line:90%
below clinical threshold.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Their nightmare
experience was reduced.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And this time, we were
able to compare it

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:84%
to a similar group that had gone
through the same period of time,

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:84%
also got poked and
prodded by scientists.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And the difference
was still there.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be, I think,
an important and impactful study

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
in the medical field because
PTSD is very difficult to treat.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:10%
And this is a methodology
that is accessible to people.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:90%
You just got to dream.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Beyond trauma recovery, lucid
dreaming serves as a gateway

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.050 align:middle line:90%
to deeper psychological healing.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:84%
This state allows
for the exploration

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.170 align:middle line:84%
of unresolved emotions,
repressed memories,

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and hidden aspects of the self,
offering a unique opportunity

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:90%
for personal transformation.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You are in the most depth,
deepest part of your unconscious

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
mind, so it's super powerful to
incubate and plant seeds within

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:90%
this state.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So you could say to the
dream space, inner child,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.610 align:middle line:84%
come to me now, and then
just see what happens.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes your
inner child runs up

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and you can have a beautiful
healing moment with it,

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:90%
or it might be more symbolic.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:84%
A tree might grow
out of the ground,

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and on it might be all of the
snapshots of your childhood,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and you can watch them unfold.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Or you could go--

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and this is more for
advanced practitioners,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:84%
but I love it,
the juiciest bits.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:84%
You could say, shadow,
come to me now.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So shadow is a coin
termed by Carl Jung, which

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.530 align:middle line:84%
means anything we've
suppressed, denied,

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:90%
or disowned about ourselves.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's very good
for healing trauma.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Something I tell
all of my friends

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
to do when they're first
starting out in lucid dreaming

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:90%
is to call out to the dream.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.050 align:middle line:84%
You're awake, you're
lucid, you're aware.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Just call out, show
me what I need to see,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:90%
and then just see what happens.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Someone might come up to you.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:90%
There might be a huge rainstorm.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:90%
A tree might come up.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Something beautiful might
come into your existence.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But something that you need to
see in your life will happen,

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:90%
and it can be super insightful.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Problem-solving is another
big benefit of lucid dreaming

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.440 align:middle line:84%
because once you get lucid, you
gain access to this huge library

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge that resides
in the unconscious mind.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.930 align:middle line:84%
If we think of this idea of
the iceberg of consciousness,

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
in the waking state,
we have access

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:84%
to this top 10% of the iceberg,
the conscious mind that's

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:90%
above the surface.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But the vast majority
of our mental capacity

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:84%
is beneath the surface,
just like an iceberg.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a lucid dream,
you gain conscious access

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:84%
to that 90% of the iceberg
that is beneath the surface.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you become lucid,
and in the lucid dream,

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.470 align:middle line:84%
you call out something,
like what career path should

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I take, or whatever the
kind of question is,

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
then you will very
often get an answer.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And the answer might
come in words printed

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.840 align:middle line:90%
on the sky in the dream.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:90%
The answer might come--

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:84%
people sometimes have
like a voice of God

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
that talks to them
in the lucid dream.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.575 align:middle line:84%
Other times, people will call
out their question to the dream

00:16:18.575 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and then a dream
character will appear.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:84%
When people have
this experience,

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:25.420 align:middle line:84%
they'll often say, oh, I think
it was a divine intervention.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> For centuries,
various traditions,

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:84%
including Tibetan Buddhism
and Mexican Toltec Shamanism,

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.210 align:middle line:84%
have described lucid dreaming
as something that can be

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:90%
cultivated.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So lucid dreaming in the
Buddhist tradition goes back

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
pretty much to the
time of Buddha himself,

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.740 align:middle line:84%
more than 2,500 years ago, when
the teachings of Buddha move up

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:84%
into the Himalayan regions,
especially the land of Tibet,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that lucid dreaming takes a
really fundamental role within

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:90%
Buddhism.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:10%
Dream yoga, or milam naljor,
holds a really vital position

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:10%
in the teachings.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And it said it's a
practice that can actually

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:84%
allow us to reach full spiritual
enlightenment in our sleep.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.660 align:middle line:84%
The other spiritual
tradition in which

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
lucid dreaming plays
such a major role

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:20.589 align:middle line:84%
is the Toltec Mexica tradition,
which is the shamanic Indigenous

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:24.849 align:middle line:84%
tradition that existed in
Mexico, dating back to around a

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:90%
thousand years ago.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:84%
There were certain
meditations, essentially,

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:33.160 align:middle line:84%
self-hypnosis practices, use
of affirmations and mantras

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:84%
that you do as
you're falling asleep

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and before bed that allow
you to intentionally induce

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:90%
lucid dreaming.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that we use lucid
dreaming in both the Toltec

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Mexica tradition and the Tibetan
Buddhist tradition is the same.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not just as a use
for spiritual practice,

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually as a
preparation for death and dying.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Both these traditions
say that when you die,

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:84%
you may have the capacity to
recognize the death process.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And recognition of
the death process

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.215 align:middle line:84%
can lead you to full spiritual
awakening at the point of death.

00:18:05.215 --> 00:18:08.780 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet science
long dismissed it,

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:15.320 align:middle line:84%
believing awareness and
sleep could not coexist.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
That changed in 1975,
when researchers first

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:84%
measured controlled eye
movements in REM sleep.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:10%
This breakthrough paved the
way for further validation,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.350 align:middle line:10%
including Stephen LaBerge's
pioneering studies at Stanford

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:10%
in the 1980s.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So they've got EEG showing
that the person is in REM sleep,

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:84%
so it's unequivocal
the person is asleep.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And then because
you can do things

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:84%
that you planned ahead of
time from the waking state,

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:84%
they had planned that the lucid
dreamer, once awake, would send

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.240 align:middle line:90%
signals to the researchers.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So Stephen LaBerge and
his group at Stanford

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.340 align:middle line:84%
said, OK, when you
wake up in your dream,

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and we verify this
by EEG, then I

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:84%
want you to send these eye
signals to us that you're awake

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:04.830 align:middle line:90%
in your dream.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And they'd have them do certain
tasks and signal back and forth.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So that was, I think, the first
really compelling neuroscience

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
evidence that lucid
dreaming is real.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.920 align:middle line:90%
It's verified.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So around 2009, '10 and '11,
there was a big rash of neural

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:84%
studies into lucid dreaming,
where for the first time,

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:84%
they got somebody to fall
asleep inside an fMRI scanner,

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:84%
a functional magnetic resonance
imaging scanner, basically,

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.790 align:middle line:90%
a brain scanner.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, when they got someone
to fall asleep in it

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and that person was able
to have a lucid dream,

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, they
had live images of the brain

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
at the moment
someone became lucid.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's very cool because
you can see this online.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
You see these
images of the brain.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And the back part of the
brain is highly active

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.150 align:middle line:84%
because that's where the
projector system for dreaming

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
The occipital lobe, the
visual cortex, the brainstem,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:84%
all light up when you're in
normal non-lucid dreaming.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:84%
But the front part of the
brain was completely offline.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:84%
There were no colored lights
there because the person

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:90%
was dreaming.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you dream,
the prefrontal cortex

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:90%
is not engaged.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:84%
However, at a certain point, you
see the front part of the brain

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.690 align:middle line:84%
light up like a Christmas tree,
while the back part of the brain

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:90%
is still lit up.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was the moment,
for the first time ever,

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.030 align:middle line:84%
they had recorded the neural
correlates of lucid dreaming.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And they saw these very specific
brain networks lighting up--

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
brain network associated with
sense of self, with agency,

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and with, I am
having an experience.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we do have direct neural
correlates for lucid dreaming.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.475 align:middle line:84%
We can tell when someone's
having a lucid dream

00:20:37.475 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:90%
and when they're not.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.250 align:middle line:90%
And there's no way to fake it.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Through specific techniques,
dreamers can train themselves

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the dream
state, gain awareness,

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and even shape their
experiences within it.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the first techniques
that we can use are the four Ds.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:10%
The first D is dream planning.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Decide what you want to do in
your first or next lucid dream.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:84%
If you have a really
good reason why

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
you want to have a lucid
dream, that is the most

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:90%
powerful technique there is.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you can think of
something really powerful,

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.700 align:middle line:84%
something that's
really beneficial,

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.650 align:middle line:84%
something that's
really life-changing,

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.800 align:middle line:84%
then you can get lucid just
through the power of intention.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to become
lucid and meditate and do

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.790 align:middle line:84%
your spiritual practice and have
a powerful spiritual experience

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that awaits you within
the lucid dream.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it is,
decide what you want

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:90%
to do before you become lucid.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:90%
The second D is dream recall.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:10%
>> As you go to sleep,
if you think this is you,

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:10%
I want you to say at that
point when you're a bit drowsy,

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.010 align:middle line:10%
next time I'm dreaming, I'll
remember that I'm dreaming.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Next time I'm dreaming, I'll
remember that I'm dreaming.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So you are planting that
suggestion in the hypnogogic,

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
this hypnotic state, before
you sleep, as a suggestion,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.770 align:middle line:84%
so that when you're dreaming,
it will tap you on the back

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and be like, hey,
you're dreaming.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.420 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Wake up.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's a suggestion, a
bit like an affirmation.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And then when you wake
up, keep a dream diary.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>> The third D, dream diaries.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:84%
The act of writing
down your dreams

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:84%
helps to take the memory
of an unconscious process

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and bring it consciously
down onto the page.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So you want to write this
down as soon as possible.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Don't move your body too much
because weirdly moving your body

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:90%
can make you forget your dream.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:90%
So write down whatever it is.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you start to
keep the dream diary,

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.100 align:middle line:84%
you can see these emerging
patterns of things that only

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.340 align:middle line:90%
happen in your dreams.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's the fourth
D, dream signs.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.980 align:middle line:10%
A dream sign is any
person, thing, or activity

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:10%
that can indicate to you that
you are definitely dreaming.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.550 align:middle line:84%
So dead relatives, living in
a place that you don't live,

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:84%
being friends with
celebrities, talking animals.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.420 align:middle line:84%
If it can't happen
in real life, that

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
can only happen in your
dream, it's a dream sign.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.490 align:middle line:84%
By keeping the dream
diary, you start

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:84%
to take note of
your dream signs.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And by taking note of them,
you're creating a trigger.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:84%
You're saying, oh,
my dead grandma only

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:90%
appears in my dreams.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.300 align:middle line:84%
You're making these triggers,
these links between the dream

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
signs and the fact
that you are dreaming.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So then a week or so later,
when your dead grandma

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.740 align:middle line:84%
comes into your dream again,
something is triggered.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:84%
This sense of, wait,
my dead grandma.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:21.570 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she's one of my dream signs.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm dreaming.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:90%
And then you can become lucid.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.560 align:middle line:84%
There are literally dozens
of lucid dreaming techniques,

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
but the four Ds are a
good place to start.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
- By recognizing
patterns in our dreams,

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.020 align:middle line:84%
lucid dreamers develop the
ability to wake up inside them.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But beyond gaining control
of the dream state,

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.550 align:middle line:84%
could this practice also
reshape our perception

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:90%
of waking reality?

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.350 align:middle line:10%
- I think that one of the most
profound benefits, potentially,

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.400 align:middle line:10%
of lucid dreaming
is to influence

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:10%
our attitude towards
reality itself.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So in a lucid dream,
this is like a practice

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:84%
for realizing that we're
creating all this reality.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
You get to experience this
shift in your consciousness to,

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I was separate and now I'm
connected to everything.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.220 align:middle line:84%
The more you can
get used to that,

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe the better you'll be
able to do it in waking life

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.810 align:middle line:90%
and live lucidly.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.710 align:middle line:10%
- So I think a side effect of
having enough lucid dreams is

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:10%
eventually, it starts to
flow into the waking state

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:10%
and you start to have these
experiences of lucidity in life.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's not that
you now have the ability

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.820 align:middle line:84%
to fly like you do
in the lucid dream,

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.278 align:middle line:84%
but you definitely
have the ability

00:24:38.278 --> 00:24:39.866 align:middle line:84%
to fly beyond your
own limitations.

00:24:39.866 --> 00:24:43.200 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> You will access parts of
yourself you didn't even realize

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:90%
that were there.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And when we illuminate those,
when we wake up to those,

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
there's this shift in our
mind, in consciousness,

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and it ricochets, it bubbles
up to the waking state.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:10%
So then when we have a lot of
these dreams, when we wake up,

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:10%
that potential for the desires,
the different parts of trauma we

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.350 align:middle line:10%
can heal, it all comes over
into this waking state.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So we begin to wake up to
ourselves in this dream,

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.500 align:middle line:84%
in this reality,
and that's what can

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:84%
be very extraordinary
for someone

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:84%
that has never even tapped into
the potential of themselves

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Lucid dreaming is
more than an exploration

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:90%
of the unconscious.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a journey into the
depths of human potential.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:35.110 align:middle line:84%
By awakening within the
dream, we awaken to ourselves,

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.140 align:middle line:84%
carrying newfound
awareness in waking life

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and unlocking a deeper
understanding of who we truly

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.950 align:middle line:90%
are.
