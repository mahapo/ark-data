Do near-death experiences
and memories of past lives

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.640 align:middle line:84%
imply the existence
of life beyond death?

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:84%
A question once relegated
to spirituality and myth

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
is now at the forefront
of scientific inquiry.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.890 align:middle line:84%
In the US, the New York
Academy of Sciences

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
published a study indicating
that nearly 9 million Americans

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:84%
have had experiences
suggestive of an afterlife.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, across the
Atlantic, the University

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:84%
of Copenhagen's research shows
that about 10% of Europeans

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:84%
report near-death experiences,
often described as more vivid

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:90%
than earthly existence.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.730 align:middle line:84%
The intersection of near-death
and reincarnation research

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:84%
suggests a consciousness
that might survive

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
beyond our physical
realm, prompting

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
renewed scientific and
philosophical inquiry.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Could there indeed
be an afterlife?

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.844 align:middle line:84%
And what signs might
indicate its existence?

>>DANNON BRINKLEY:
A lot of times,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:84%
when you come across what
people are the most afraid

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:84%
of, it's this
thing called death.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:10%
Well, I can tell you
without any question

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:10%
that there is no such thing.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:90%
How do I know?

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I have been dead, and I have
come back from the dead.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.010 align:middle line:90%
No one dies.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest lie
you will ever be told.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAM APOLLO: I've known
quite a few people who

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
have had profound
near-death experiences,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and the commonality that I find
between them is that nearly all

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:84%
of them describe
an experience where

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
they entered this luminous
realm of heavenly experience.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes, before
they enter that realm,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
there is a flashback
of their lives.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a deep internal
process that they

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:84%
go through,
relinquishing, letting go,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
grieving, sometimes
feeling scared, not

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
wanting to leave their
family, their loved ones.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.300 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of them tend to
also have a conversation

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:10%
with a being on the other
side that says, hey,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:10%
you have two choices here.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.780 align:middle line:84%
You can either come with
me, or you can go back.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And those people all
chose to go back.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: No two near-death
experiences are the same.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But when you study a lot--
and I've studied over 4,000--

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:84%
you see a very
consistent pattern

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
of elements or
characteristics, what happens

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:90%
in a near-death experience.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:84%
A common first
thing that happens

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, they have
that physical trauma

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:84%
so severe that
they're unconscious

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:90%
or even clinically dead.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Within seconds, the
electroencephalogram

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:middle line:84%
measurement of brain electrical
activity is absolutely flat.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:90%
So we know that.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.822 align:middle line:84%
We know when a person
is unconscious,

00:03:24.822 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:90%
we can measure it clinically.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
We can see their
pupils don't dilate.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:84%
They're not breathing
spontaneously.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Their heart has stopped.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
literally shut down

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:84%
at the level of the brainstem
after cardiac arrest.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:10%
And yet, by the
hundreds and hundreds,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:10%
we have people reporting
near-death experiences

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:10%
at this time.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:10%
Again, absolutely no possible
explanation of physical brain

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:10%
function whatsoever.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, when
they shouldn't have

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:90%
any memory at all, they do.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
A common first element
is what's called

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness separates
from their body,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:10%
often laying on the
floor and rises above.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And from that
vantage point, they

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:84%
can see and hear ongoing
earthly events, often

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
including frantic
efforts of people trying

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:90%
to bring them back to life.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DANNON: When I
lifted out of my body,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I was burning and on fire.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And the flash of the
lightning had burnt my eyes

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:90%
so much I could not see.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.717 align:middle line:90%
And I was paralyzed and on fire.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
I lifted out of my body.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:90%
I have no pain.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:90%
I see myself lying on the bed.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I heard the paramedic
say, he's gone.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:90%
He's gone.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel this tunnel
forming over my left shoulder.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And I looked, and I was
pulled down this tunnel.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And I came into this place of
light, bright, beautiful light.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And
then in that realm,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
there in what we call
unearthly, or if you will,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
heavenly realms, they
can also encounter what

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.820 align:middle line:90%
we would call spiritual beings.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
These are beings
variably described.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.110 align:middle line:90%
They may be called angels.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:84%
They may be called
spiritual beings.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
The near-death
experiencer will often

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
ask the questions
that are, if you will,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.745 align:middle line:84%
some of the greatest
questions that we in humankind

00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:00.120 align:middle line:84%
have answered
throughout history.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:90%
And they get answers.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And what's so remarkable
is that these answers

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:90%
are remarkably consistent.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Further strong evidence
that near-death experiences

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:84%
are not the creation of prior
pre-existing earthly belief,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
cultural beliefs, or
even religious beliefs.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.540 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
new, something dramatic,

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
information that
they're receiving

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:84%
that is information that
they never knew of before

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't even have
conceived of before.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Such consistently
reported encounters across

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:84%
diverse cultures and backgrounds
highlight a significant aspect

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.830 align:middle line:90%
of the near-death journey--

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:84%
the meeting with entities that
embody wisdom far surpassing

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.480 align:middle line:90%
our worldly experiences.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DANNON: And then I moved
into this crystal cathedral,

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:90%
and I'm met by these 13 beings.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And they radiated, and
there was a 13th being.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And the 13th being
controlled everything,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:90%
and it would designate a being.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And that being would
begin to radiate

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.200 align:middle line:90%
until it was nothing but that.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But I could smell it and
sense it, and be around it.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I was not separate from
anything and nothing

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.747 align:middle line:90%
was separate from me.

where we can ask
anything we wish.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.960 align:middle line:10%
And they're not judges.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:10%
They are loving, kind, welcoming
beings that give us direction.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Not advice, but direction.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And usually, about
understanding--

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.902 align:middle line:84%
a bigger purpose,
what our purpose is.

00:06:39.902 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: They may have
what's called a life review.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:84%
They may become aware or
even all of their prior life.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, they're often
feeling intense, unearthly

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.270 align:middle line:84%
positive motions and even have
a sense so often described

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.700 align:middle line:84%
that this unearthly
beautiful realm seems

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.898 align:middle line:90%
to be their real home.

00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DANNON: You're going to see
your whole life pass before you

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:90%
in a 360 degree panorama.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:84%
You're going to watch it like
a second person point of view

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
as though you were
your own best friend.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And so when you see
how stupid you are,

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:84%
you see how funny and
wonderful you are,

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.670 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't have an ego to it.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like a friend telling
you, and then you're

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.048 align:middle line:84%
going to literally become every
person that you ever encounter.

00:07:20.048 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
feel the direct results

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.300 align:middle line:84%
of your interaction between
you and that person.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.670 align:middle line:84%
That means nobody gets
away with anything.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
is fair and just.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you will ask
yourself a question.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:84%
In the life you just reviewed,
what difference did you

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:90%
and the divine make?

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
That is the single most
life changing structure

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:84%
that almost everybody who's
ever had this experience says

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.060 align:middle line:90%
happens to them.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you stop and look at
that panoramic life review,

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and you see the impact it
has, if that's not the point

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
where you change
and shift, then you

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
are making a horrible,
horrible mistake

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:84%
in the power of your thoughts,
the grace of your love,

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
your ability to reflect the
divinity in your actions

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and your deeds,
and the elevation

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
of your spiritual consciousness
to the next octave.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: To me
personally, I think

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.060 align:middle line:84%
some of the strongest
evidence for the reality

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:84%
of a near-death experience
is these consistent, what

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:84%
you could call
spiritual messages

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:84%
that the near-death
experiencer brings back.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Over and over, they come
back with an awareness

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:84%
that love is the predominant
force in the universe.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Within the
scientific community,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:84%
there's a diverse range
of opinions when it comes

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.850 align:middle line:90%
to near-death experiences.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: In my entire
life as a scientist,

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:84%
it is absolutely amazing
to me, that disconnect

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experience
skeptics between what we all

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:84%
know is conventional
and appropriate science

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and between how the skeptics
view and try to process

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:90%
near-death experiences.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the skeptics
are so convinced

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.240 align:middle line:84%
that near-death experiences must
be due to the physical brain

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.650 align:middle line:84%
function that they completely
throw out the window all

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.030 align:middle line:84%
that they learned
as a scientist,

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:84%
in terms of scientific
methodology and investigation

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and explaining
what you observed.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:10%
In science, you
would look at what

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:10%
occurs during a
near-death experience,

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:10%
you would observe all
the characteristics,

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:10%
and then you would try to
develop a hypothesis that

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:10%
explains what is
actually observed

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:10%
during a near-death experience.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, speaking
collectively about skeptics

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experience, that's
not the science they follow.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Over and over, we
hear people coming up

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:84%
with ideas that
have nothing to do

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:84%
with what we're
observing so consistently

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:90%
in near-death experiences.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: While
near-death experiences

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:84%
provide one layer
of understanding

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.380 align:middle line:84%
about the continuity
of consciousness,

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:84%
the concept of
reincarnation introduces

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:84%
a different dimension to
the exploration of life

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:90%
beyond its physical form.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Hypnotic regression offers
a significant Avenue

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
in this exploration, revealing
detailed past life memories.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:84%
When these recollections
are validated

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:84%
with striking accuracy,
they provide not just

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:84%
personal affirmations but
also substantial evidence

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.800 align:middle line:84%
for the Soul's journey
across multiple lifetimes.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:10%
>> GEORGINA: In about 2010, a
major network came and asked me

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.120 align:middle line:10%
if I would be prepared to work
with them to verify whether

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.790 align:middle line:10%
past life regression
was real or not.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:10%
And I said yes, I would.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:90%
One of them was amazing.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
He was a gentleman
in his mid 40s

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I think who certainly did
not believe in past lives

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.930 align:middle line:90%
before he did this.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And he was a Jesuit
priest trainee in Ireland.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the end,
he killed himself.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:90%
He committed suicide.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he didn't get
buried in the burial ground.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
He was buried outside when
they took him back to Ireland,

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
because they took these
people back to where

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:90%
they had that past life.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:90%
He was overcome with emotion.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And he knew exactly
where things were.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:84%
He knew where his room
was in that building.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:90%
He knew-- he just went.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:84%
He was just guided there, and
he'd never been there before.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:90%
This to me is verification.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAM: We as beings are
having a continuous stream

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:90%
of experience.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:84%
That experience doesn't
end when we die.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:84%
We continue
experiencing ourselves

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
having the experience of, I am
the perception that we exist.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And then perhaps we
lose a little bit

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:84%
of the memory of
everything that we've just

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.200 align:middle line:84%
been through as
we shove ourselves

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
into a new tiny little packet
of cells becoming a body

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:90%
and are born again.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Having another
lifetime of experience,

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
going through big changes,
learning new lessons,

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:09.750 align:middle line:84%
growing as a soul before we die
and start the journey again.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we die,
does it all just end?

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.110 align:middle line:84%
We likely change the
way that our body works.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
We are operating now
outside of a physical body,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:90%
but in a different body--

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:84%
a body that is still assembled
of light, a body that still

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
operates with all
of these different

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:84%
capacities to sense and
feel and relate with others.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And for those that have had
deep and profound afterlife

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:84%
experiences, they
would describe it

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:84%
as not that different from this
world, yet a little less fixed.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Things are a little less
tactile and tangible.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.330 align:middle line:84%
But like a dream, they
still can be experienced

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
with just as much
depth and realism

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:90%
as each of our incarnations.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Eastern philosophy,
as in other traditions,

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:84%
sees the journey of
incarnation as a tapestry woven

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:14.110 align:middle line:84%
from experiences and memories
carried within the subtle body.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:18.400 align:middle line:84%
This ethereal vessel,
encompassing the ego, mind,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and soul, holds the accumulated
qualities and karmic imprints

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.640 align:middle line:90%
of past lives.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:10%
Though individuals
may not consciously

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:10%
recall these past experiences,
they suddenly influence

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.640 align:middle line:10%
the current life, shaping
thoughts, behaviors,

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.085 align:middle line:10%
and one's personal journey.

00:13:36.085 --> 00:13:38.970 align:middle line:10%


00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.940 align:middle line:10%
DR. TONY NADER: And it must
be a protective mechanism

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.120 align:middle line:10%
because to carry all
the load of memory

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:10%
from before on a surface
level is not obvious.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:84%
But we do carry it on
some genetic level,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.860 align:middle line:90%
on some subconscious level.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.140 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, that's
why we come back

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:10%
with certain characteristics,
with certain beliefs,

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:10%
with certain patterns, with
certain conditions of life,

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:10%
depending on our previous life.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAM: Upon death, the
spirit leaves the body--

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:90%
what we call the spirit.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, that portion
that can exit the body

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:84%
is literally every plane of
existence above the physical.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So our etheric body, our
astral body, our causal body,

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.980 align:middle line:84%
our Akashic body, spiritual
body, celestial body.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Each of these higher bodies
all leave the physical body,

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:84%
but maintain intactness
with themselves.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Where we go?

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:84%
That's a difficult question
because where implies

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.560 align:middle line:90%
space time to an extent.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And in a real sense, when
we enter the spirit world,

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:84%
we're exiting the structural
dynamics that space time has.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:10%
And we're now entering a
new plane of existence--

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:10%
or many planes of existence, in
which we can explore ourselves,

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:10%
our spirit, our consciousness,
and other beings in new ways

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.700 align:middle line:10%
that are definitively different
from our physical world

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:10%
of incarnations.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGINA: Life between lives
is the space between lifetimes.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the place where
the soul goes home.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:10%
You carry the experience of
your previous lives with you

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:10%
into this place, and if
the soul has been bruised,

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:10%
that's where it's healed.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.690 align:middle line:90%
There's wisdom to be gained.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.770 align:middle line:84%
That's where it's
inculcated, and that's

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:90%
where you choose what's next.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Sculpting the
trajectory of the soul

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:51.630 align:middle line:84%
through its various incarnations
is the force of destiny.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:84%
This concept shaped by
diverse cultural, religious,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual
beliefs intricately

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
weaves with Karma
and reincarnation,

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:90%
guiding the soul's journey.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.570 align:middle line:84%
TONY: So destiny is depending
on how many constraints you

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:84%
have created, and
therefore, you're

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:15.370 align:middle line:84%
going to face
certain consequences.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So the destiny of today is based
on the choice of yesterday.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:84%
When you grow in
consciousness, you

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.790 align:middle line:84%
liberate yourself from
the boundaries of karma,

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:84%
from the boundaries
of previous actions.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you have
more freedom of choice.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, in
coming back, if you

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:84%
want to put it in the
context of reincarnation,

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.550 align:middle line:84%
you have a set of
constraints that

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.220 align:middle line:90%
put you in certain situations.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:84%
But also, depending
on the consciousness

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:84%
you have developed, you have
a certain level of freedom

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:84%
in selecting the conditions
in which you can come.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If choices from
the past shape our destiny,

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.550 align:middle line:84%
influencing the freedoms
and constraints we encounter

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.640 align:middle line:84%
in each incarnation, then
the question arises--

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
why would a soul choose a life
marked by pain and hardship?

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGINA: The question of why
we choose pain and suffering

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:10%
is that the conscious
mind doesn't choose it,

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:10%
but the soul chooses
it because maybe we

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:10%
have something to learn.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we be we have
to learn humility.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we have to learn how
to be open and generous

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:90%
and giving and forgiving.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a soul lesson
that we're here for.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.970 align:middle line:90%
Some people call it karma.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.950 align:middle line:10%
TONY: If you make
the wrong decisions,

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:10%
you accumulate karma.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And that karma is
determined thing.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:54.700 align:middle line:84%
For example, you plant a
seed that creates apples,

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and then a few years
later, you come back

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:90%
and you want to eat mango.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So you say, I'm miserable
because I don't like apple

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:90%
anymore, and I want now mango.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.030 align:middle line:90%
But you have planted the seed.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you raise
your consciousness,

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:84%
you can take your
apples to the market,

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.190 align:middle line:84%
sell them, and buy
mango and eat mango.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
But if your
consciousness is limited,

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:84%
you will only see the
apple tree and not

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:84%
know that there is even an
option to do something else.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.382 align:middle line:84%
So freedom grows
with consciousness.

00:18:27.382 --> 00:18:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DANNON: As a
spiritual being, you

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.730 align:middle line:84%
came here to enjoy
challenging yourself

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and to reinforce a
belief in divine law

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:84%
because you have life,
and you are alive.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Beyond
individual choices

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:84%
and karmic consequences,
there exists

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:84%
a dimension where souls are
thought to form pre-life pacts.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
These agreements
made with other souls

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
can shape various
aspects of life,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:84%
influencing challenges,
relationships, and shared

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:84%
missions, intricately
intertwining their paths

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
with others in a dance
of spiritual evolution.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAM: Now, we may have
made those contracts out

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:84%
of moments of great trauma
or moments of great pleasure

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:90%
and bliss.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
We have different reasons
why we choose to reconnect

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:90%
with another person.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We may have made an oath
that I will haunt you

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your lifetimes.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Or we may have had an experience
where we realized that someone

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:39.230 align:middle line:84%
is so deeply beautiful and
so important to us as a soul

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:84%
that we want to reconnect
with them in every lifetime.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:47.550 align:middle line:84%
TONY: The soul has to
evolve, and therefore, it

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:90%
finds the opportunities.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And it makes a
contract with existence

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:90%
that allows it to evolve.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:10%
So what we take from this is,
whatever your situation is,

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:10%
consider it to be the
best possible situation

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:10%
for you to grow.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that is where we
have always the choice,

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and we shouldn't assume
that if the situation is

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
not this goodness to someone
else that it's bad for us.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:84%
We always come in the very
best possible conditions

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:90%
for our own evolution.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The concept
of choice plays

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.700 align:middle line:84%
a pivotal role in the soul's
journey across lifetimes.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Some beliefs advocate
that the soul itself

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:84%
chooses its path, selecting
life experiences for growth

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.190 align:middle line:90%
and learning.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Others propose that higher
powers or cosmic forces

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:84%
guide these decisions,
aligning each incarnation

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.897 align:middle line:84%
with a broader divine
plan or karmic blueprint.

00:20:49.897 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:10%
>>DANNON: There's
like a billion of us

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.610 align:middle line:10%
waiting to see who's
going to get chosen

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:10%
to take that first breath.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:10%
Like a billion of us.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.950 align:middle line:10%
Come on.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.157 align:middle line:10%
To have free will?

00:21:00.157 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, wait a minute.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to hug
somebody and feel my own love?

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, wait a minute.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Let me go.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is, you set up
probable possibilities, OK?

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Because the divine
mission-- you won't fail it.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:84%
You make choices of probable
possibilities of goals.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever
effects that come

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.220 align:middle line:84%
into play, based on
achieving your goals,

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:84%
creates the reality
that you're living in.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Who we are
and whether that

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:84%
is driven by a sense
of personal mission,

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.610 align:middle line:84%
the pursuit of love, service,
or any other reason to exist

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:84%
lies at the heart of
our quest to understand.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Is there more to life than
merely our physical existence?

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:90%


00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGINA: Your soul
journeys, and the wisdom

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.740 align:middle line:10%
that both carry--
both your ancestors

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:10%
that you can bring forward
and your soul journeys

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:05.202 align:middle line:10%
that you can bring forward-- you
are so much more than you know

00:22:05.202 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:10%
>>JEFFREY: We couldn't figure
out why some people have near

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:10%
death experiences
and some don't.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:84%
But finally, one day, I
received a near death experience

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.580 align:middle line:84%
that I think contained
the answer to that

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:84%
from someone who had a
near death experience.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And she was in the
presence of God.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And she was having
such a remarkably

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:84%
positive near death
experience that she just

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.370 align:middle line:90%
asked God flat out, why me?

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Why was I so special that this
should have happened to me?

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:35.230 align:middle line:10%
And God's response was,
everyone is special.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:10%
Love falls on everyone equally.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:43.510 align:middle line:84%
This is what you needed
to live your earthly life.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I read that,
I think I said, that's it.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.970 align:middle line:84%
That explains it better
than anything else

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.900 align:middle line:90%
I've ever read or considered.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAM: Our journey
through incarnations

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:90%
teaches us about ourselves.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Some would say that the end
of the spiritual journey

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:84%
is just seeking to dissolve
back into the infinite eternal

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:90%
of God.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But I say, if you already are
God, and you came from God,

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
isn't the point of
the spiritual journey

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:84%
then to experience all the
different ways that God can be?

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.900 align:middle line:90%
What if both are just as sacred?

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:84%
The experience of all
the diversity of life

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.920 align:middle line:84%
is just as rich and
important as the experience

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.050 align:middle line:90%
of oneness and wholeness.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.540 align:middle line:10%
This, I think,
from my own journey

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:10%
is true, that I am a soul
seeking new experiences,

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:10%
that if I wanted to dissolve
back into the source of all

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:10%
that is, I could do so.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:84%
But personally, I
love being different.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:90%
I love forgetting.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.480 align:middle line:90%
I love remembering.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.420 align:middle line:90%
I love being human.

Absolutely.

You will never die.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:90%
