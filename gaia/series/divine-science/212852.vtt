Is DMT a portal to another
dimension, a key to unlocking

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:90%
ancient knowledge?

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Often referred to as
the spirit molecule,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:84%
DMT is unique for its profound,
near-death like experiences

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.860 align:middle line:84%
that propel the mind into realms
of expanded consciousness.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:84%

evokes profound experiences,

DMT offer insights

human consciousness

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.465 align:middle line:90%
and our place in the cosmos?

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>> DMT is the most powerful
psychedelic known on Earth.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:10%
And it's a fascinating
substance that may well be more

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:10%
than a psychedelic drug.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>> When most people
speak of DMT,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:84%
they're primarily referring
to something called

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
N,N-dimethyltryptamine
or N,N-DMT.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the active
ingredients of ayahuasca,

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:84%
consumed as a drink in
ceremonial situations.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.410 align:middle line:90%
The experience is very intense.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:84%
One will completely lose
touch with this reality

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and are thrust into
another reality that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.440 align:middle line:84%
is very foreign and
alien with images

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that are hyper colorful
and intensely meaningful.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> One understanding of DMT is
that it's not a hallucinatory

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:90%
substance.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But rather, it reorients
the neurotransmitters

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:84%
to be receptive to a different
yet altogether real reality

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that we're just not able to
perceive in our waking state,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a lucid dream where
your experience is so foreign.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you retain
your consciousness.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.430 align:middle line:84%
You maintain your
sense of self and ego.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's very common
among DMT users to say,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:90%
this was not a hallucination.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:90%
This was reality.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's similar each time
they take the same substance.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In the realm of DMT, two
primary variants stand out--

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:90%
N,N-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
N,N-DMT Is renowned for
its capacity to facilitate

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.650 align:middle line:84%
encounters with
interdimensional beings,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:84%
offering a unique
psychedelic experience.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Alternatively, 5-MeO-DMT,
closely associated

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:84%
with the bufo alvarius
toad, is known

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
for inducing profound
ego dissolution

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.010 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual awakenings.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Trained practitioners
must exercise caution

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.620 align:middle line:84%
to safeguard these
delicate creatures

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and their dwindling habitats,
ensuring their protection

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:90%
and preservation.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:10%
Although these compounds
share some similarities,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.040 align:middle line:10%
it's essential to recognize
their distinct effects

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.660 align:middle line:10%
and potential.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:10%
>> N,N-DMT is a molecule that
is found in the ayahuasca brew.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And that tends to be a
very visually stimulating

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
experience, where people
will see beings, encounter

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
other realms, whereas 5-MeO-DMT
is sourced organically

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:84%
from a toad in the
Sonoran Desert.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And it is vaporized and inhaled.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And it is characterized
by a non-dual state

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.100 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So it induces this state of
oneness, where there aren't

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:90%
other beings or other realms.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.450 align:middle line:84%
It is essentially
an experience where

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.210 align:middle line:84%
the subject and the object
become one and the same.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, people will come
back from their experience

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
with 5-MeO and say, that
was it that, that was thing

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:84%
that all religions
are pointing to.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:90%
I experienced God.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:84%
They may come back with this
realization that they are God

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and that everything is God
and that this beautiful game

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that we're playing as
humans is just that.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It's this game that
we get to play.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the game, beyond the
illusion of separateness,

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:84%
there is this overarching
oneness that a lot of people

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.845 align:middle line:90%
will describe as God.

00:04:56.845 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>> At the top, there's
5-MeO, or the toad.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
When you take that, you
feel like you just meet God.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:84%
It's the ultimate
psychedelic experience.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.001 align:middle line:84%
The next level below that
is what's called DMT.

00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the common
forms is Changa.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And with that, if
you are successful,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you break through
to this other world called

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:90%
the DMT verse.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:84%
You go through a tunnel,
often as reported

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.140 align:middle line:84%
by users of the
most vibrant colors

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:90%
you can possibly imagine.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you are
in this space where

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:84%
you may feel like the fabric of
the universe is being created.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:84%
There may or may not be
individuals that you see.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But the whole environment is
cursing with intelligence.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>> DMT or dimethyltryptamine
is present in most forms

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.890 align:middle line:90%
of biological life on Earth.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:84%
While this is a fascinating
aspect of the compound,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
the reasons for its
widespread presence

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.330 align:middle line:90%
are not fully understood.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.690 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the curious things
about DMT is the abundance

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:10%
of it in nature.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:10%
It's in most plants.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.250 align:middle line:10%
And it's widely regarded that
it's in the pineal gland.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's important
because when you take DMT,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:84%
it acts so fast that
you can't believe it.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's because when
you ingest DMT in some form,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.580 align:middle line:84%
it's activating the
DMT that's already

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:84%
in your pineal gland, that's
already passed the blood brain

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:90%
barrier.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why you feel this
immediate intense reaction.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Why it's so abundant
throughout Earth

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and still relatively
unknown is a mystery to me.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Why it's there,
how it got there--

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:90%
I think it's not an accident.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it's our ticket
once we transcend

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:84%
to the level of sophistication
to understand it and use

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.620 align:middle line:84%
it correctly to then
use it as a portal

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:84%
to the ultimate reality
of the universe.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:90%


00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>> 5-MeO-DMT and N,N-DMT--

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.070 align:middle line:84%
studies have shown that they
are released by the body

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:84%
during moments of birth
and moments of death.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that's interesting
to me because they're

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.530 align:middle line:84%
like an intermediary between
states of consciousness.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.780 align:middle line:84%
They're like a guide
that welcome us

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.150 align:middle line:90%
into this realm of being human.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And then when the time
comes for us to die

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and for us to go on into
whatever comes next,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.130 align:middle line:84%
they guide us into that
next stage of our journey.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fascinating
that they're already

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:84%
present in the human
body and that they

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.370 align:middle line:84%
play some significant role
in this transition of states

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is DMT the only
psychedelic drug that seems

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:84%
to have taken up
residence in our brains?

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:84%
The theory is that
it helps us cope

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:84%
with such monumental
experiences that

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:84%
are beyond the
normal pale of life,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
sort of like a safety or a
buffer for these experiences

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.712 align:middle line:90%
that are so intense.

00:08:30.712 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the reasons why our
brain might produce DMT is

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.100 align:middle line:10%
because it's a neuroprotectant,
meaning in hypoxic or low

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:10%
oxygen environments,
such as cardiac arrest,

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:45.810 align:middle line:10%
there may be a DMT dump, which
accounts for why there are

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle line:10%
gamma spikes during
cardiac arrest.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And the DMT protects the neurons
from dying off prematurely.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.630 align:middle line:84%
That might be one of the reasons
why DMT is in our brain--

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
to actually protect the brain
against these low oxygen

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:90%
environments.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Many scientists posit that
our perception of reality is

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:84%
a construct of the brain, a kind
of controlled hallucination,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:84%
where our brain interprets
sensory data to create a model

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:84%
DMT experiences invite us
to reconsider and question

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.040 align:middle line:84%
the very structure and nature
of our everyday perception.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:10%
>> The 2019 study that came out
of University of Michigan that

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:10%
Jon Dean studied in rats how
they produce endogenous DMT,

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:10%
we came to find that the brain
produces DMT all the time.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:10%
So we have to start asking
why is it being produced all

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:10%
the time and in levels
comparable to serotonin,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:10%
dopamine, and norepinephrine.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:84%
These are functional
neurotransmitters.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:84%
If DMT is being produced around
the clock in comparable levels,

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
one could theorize that we are
constantly microdosing on DMT--

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.100 align:middle line:90%
all of us at all times.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So could this reality be
a shared hallucination?

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:84%
There is a basis for
this idea that we

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:84%
are living in a projected,
simulated reality

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:84%
from the consciousness
of all people,

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
meaning this is a
shared hallucination.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:10%
Actually, the most
recent Nobel Prize winner

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:10%
disproved local reality, meaning
that when nobody is observing

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.760 align:middle line:10%
something like a table
or a chair, that object

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:10%
does not exist anymore.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So much of what we would call
a part of our reality actually

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:90%
might be a shared hallucination.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people, unfamiliar
with DMT's effects,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.080 align:middle line:84%
might find a purely biological
explanation sufficient.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the DMT experience often
triggers a fundamental paradigm

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:90%
shift.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:84%
DMT's capacity to induce
extraordinary visions

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
challenges the notion of
its mere biological presence

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.720 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Could it instead be a portal
to spiritually profound realms,

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
suggesting a reality far more
intricate than we perceive?

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> When someone smokes DMT,
the effects are very quick.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:84%
It's usually people will
take a few inhalations

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:90%
of the medicine.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And before they're done
with the first inhalation,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
the world is starting to change
and transform around them.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.950 align:middle line:90%
And then the person lays down.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's a space
of like elevation.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Everything feels
like it's rising.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Sound will elevate.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Colors will start to unfold.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And then they're thrust
into another realm.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And the space itself
is-- sometimes,

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.070 align:middle line:84%
people describe it as
like being in a large dome

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:84%
or in an alien landscape or
connecting with ancestors

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:90%
or entities from another space.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And it can feel
very overwhelming

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:84%
because of the amount of
stimulation that's occurring--

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:21.090 align:middle line:84%
hyper vivid colors,
sounds, music changes,

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:84%
the duration of the
peak of the journey

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
is typically four
to seven minutes.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:84%
People might move
around a lot or unwind

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
as they release and clear old
stuckness in their bodies.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.435 align:middle line:90%
[SHIVERING]

00:12:41.435 --> 00:12:46.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Stay with it.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.000 align:middle line:10%
Just as you start to orient
to it, within a few minutes,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.610 align:middle line:10%
you start to come back out of
it and reconnect to the body

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:10%
and become more conscious
of this consensus space.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> There's points where I could
feel the experience move itself

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:84%
from my visual perspective and
put itself kind of directly

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.680 align:middle line:90%
into my body and in my mind.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
So it was more about
downloads and the feeling

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.760 align:middle line:90%
of other entities being around--

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.650 align:middle line:84%
all around and getting certain
bits and pieces of information

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:90%
from them.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And then they just kind of
like let me kind of coast

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:90%
back down back here.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Not long after that,
you're back to normal reality,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.470 align:middle line:84%
completely sober but just have
had a sometimes life-changing

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:48.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Within the
psychedelic ecosystem,

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
experiences often align
closely with personal traumas

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:90%
or current life events.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
In the case of N, N-DMT,
a notable number of users

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:84%
share reports of
encountering similar entities

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and having comparable
experiences.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> DMT seems to
transport you to another,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.090 align:middle line:84%
very structured reality,
meaning something gave it that

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
entities or beings

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.070 align:middle line:90%
that we connect to only on DMT.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.740 align:middle line:10%
>> You encountered beings
in this experience?

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Their eyes were very--

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:90%
they were large.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:90%
But they kind of angled more.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:90%
And they were slanted back more.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:90%
The head was an odd elongation.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there
was a few instances

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.260 align:middle line:84%
where I noticed that
there was no mouth.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So why is there this chemical
inside the brain in that,

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
let's say, reality channel,
you can connect with these very

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:90%
highly intelligent beings.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't just say
that DMT is only there

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:84%
as an anti-inflammatory
and a neuroprotective.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do a breathing
technique that upregulates DMT

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and you're now communicating
with pan dimensional entities,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.145 align:middle line:84%
God wouldn't have done
that for no reason.

00:15:08.145 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the ways that DMT is
qualitatively different than

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:84%
other psychedelics and
in particular N,N-DMT,

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
which is my favorite, is
how similar the reports

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:84%
of experiences that people
have, including my own.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Whether you have a different
people in the same room doing

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:84%
DMT at the same time,
they may come back

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.620 align:middle line:84%
saying that they've
seen the same entities.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:84%
It can be that
level of specificity

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
but the same overall
type of experience.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.880 align:middle line:84%
When you do it
the next time, you

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:84%
may feel like you're seeing
the same intelligence again.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:84%
You're just popping
by a little cameo

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:84%
role on that ever
present universe, which

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:84%
is very different than,
say, taking mushrooms.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Oftentimes, when people
take these medicines together,

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
they're done in a ceremonial
context and spiritual

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.960 align:middle line:84%
communities with a particular
community intention.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not uncommon
at all for people

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:84%
to experience the same
beings coming into the space

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
or something that's very similar
to other people's experiences.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it does bring up
questions of, What is reality?

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.865 align:middle line:84%
And it's just bigger
than what we think it is.

00:16:23.865 --> 00:16:27.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Alternatively, 5-MeO
intensifies the focus

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:90%
on internal bodily processes.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Trauma and somatic experts
view such experiences

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:84%
as potential pathways to
unlocking repressed emotions

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.700 align:middle line:90%
or memories.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It is suggested that the somatic
amplification offered by 5-MeO

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
may present opportunities
for emotional release

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:90%
and nervous system reset.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether someone's coming
to heal a significant trauma

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.760 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, whether it's
a combat veteran or someone

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:84%
who's struggling with addiction,
the medicine will meet us where

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.930 align:middle line:90%
we are.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And it will give us
whatever it is that we need.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:84%
What's consistent
is that peak state

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.019 align:middle line:84%
of oneness, where, again,
the mind is turned off,

00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:15.819 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:84%
It's like a state of,
again, non-duality,

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:90%
where there is no mind.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:84%
There is no
subject-object narrative.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And when the mind is
turned off, the body

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:90%
has this opportunity to release.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:84%
What it's releasing
is trauma that's

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
been accumulated for a lifetime,
perhaps for many lifetimes.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will come
back from the experience

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and say that they
encountered ancestors

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and that they were releasing
ancestral traumas that

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.440 align:middle line:84%
have been passed down from
generation to generation.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2006, computer scientist
and researcher Marko A.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.870 align:middle line:10%
Rodriguez formulated an
intriguing proposal--

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.090 align:middle line:10%
to determine the
reality of entities

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.670 align:middle line:10%
encountered during
DMT experiences

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:10%
by asking them to factorize
large numbers into primes.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:10%
This concept was intended to
explore the tangible reality

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:10%
of these entities, frequently
reported in DMT induced states

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:10%
by involving them in a
sophisticated mathematical

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.060 align:middle line:10%
challenge.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Marko Rodriguez has proposed
in a scientific paper one

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:84%
experiencer asking an entity
to factor a large prime number,

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:84%
which the human couldn't do, but
then another experiencer going

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
in and contacting the same
entity and bringing back that

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:90%
answer.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.270 align:middle line:10%
That would indicate
both some type

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:10%
of superhuman intelligence,
almost like a Rupert Sheldrake

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:10%
morphogenetic field that's
accessible to different people,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.650 align:middle line:10%
transmitting
verifiable information.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a couple of things
that are being proposed on how

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:84%
to test the objective
reality of these entities.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And one would be to, Can we
retrieve information from them

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
that we wouldn't possibly
be able to know, like a math

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:90%
solution?

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Another would be to put two
people into the experience

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and see if they have
similar experiences

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:90%
with the same entities.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Envision a method
to harness DMT's power,

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:84%
enabling extended exploration
of the universe and prolonged

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:84%
encounters with
interdimensional beings.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.370 align:middle line:84%
At Imperial College
London, researchers

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:84%
are developing such a technique,
named Extended-State DMT.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:84%
It involves administering
DMT intravenously,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
much like anesthesia, opening
new avenues in understanding

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:90%
consciousness and the cosmos.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>> In Extended-State DMT,
this would take what would be

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
the craziest 15-minute
psychedelic experience

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.960 align:middle line:84%
of your life and extends it
theoretically as long as you

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:90%
have the DMT.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:84%
With an infusion,
there's a loading dose

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:84%
to get you blasted
through this veil that

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.630 align:middle line:90%
seems to happen in DMT.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:84%
When people say I broke
through to the other side,

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that's breaking
through this veil.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:84%
The loading dose brings
you past that point.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the maintenance
dose keeps you

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.440 align:middle line:90%
in the peak DMT state.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And so there are a lot of
things that people are trying

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
to do with that, such as people
try to do with people having

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:90%
lucid dreams--

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.930 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with the people
while they're in the DMT state

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and to ask them, to
relate to them real time

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:90%
what they're experiencing.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that introduces the
possibility of a conversation

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:84%
with the entities
they see there to try

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:84%
to bring back verifiable,
objective evidence

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.930 align:middle line:84%
of the reality of
these encounters

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.880 align:middle line:90%
as measured by science.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And this machine can be
programmed at different levels

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:90%
of dosages.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can also program
intensity and duration.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And if there was a
crisis or a struggle,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.910 align:middle line:84%
somebody was in a space that
was uncomfortable to them,

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
turn the machine off.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And it would bring
them right back.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And they've done
this in the studies

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%
at the Imperial
College of London,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:84%
where they've done 30
minute extended state

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.450 align:middle line:90%
journeys with DMT.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And then theoretically,
it could be

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:90%
several hours or even longer.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would places like Johns
Hopkins and Imperial College

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:84%
London go to this route to say,
we need to check if the DMT

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:84%
state is actually inhabited
with these entities.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's
because we are getting

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:84%
to a point of global catastrophe
and existential risk, where we

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:90%
need outside-the-box thinking.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you can keep
somebody in the DMT state

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.080 align:middle line:84%
long enough to where they
can ask relevant questions,

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
pass the threshold back
into baseline consciousness,

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.460 align:middle line:84%
then we may be able to get
unconventional wisdom back

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.830 align:middle line:84%
into this world, where
it can be put into use

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.160 align:middle line:84%
so we can avoid maybe some of
the biggest apocalyptic events

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.540 align:middle line:90%
that we're facing right now.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:39.260 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> In the realms
accessed via DMT,

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.470 align:middle line:84%
there is potential to uncover
answers to long standing

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:90%
mysteries.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:10%
J. Allen Hynek, an American
astronomer and ufologist,

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:10%
deeply involved with the
US Air Force's UFO Studies,

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.250 align:middle line:10%
including Project Blue Book,
left many of his questions

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.540 align:middle line:10%
unanswered.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:10%
These queries have
driven his son

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:10%
Paul Hynek to seek solutions,
potentially through DMT

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.950 align:middle line:10%
research.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> He felt that the
extraterrestrial hypothesis

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:84%
didn't explain the
whole phenomenon.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:10%
So he leaned, like
Jacques Vallée and others,

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.970 align:middle line:10%
to interdimensional.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.700 align:middle line:10%
So my friend told me about the
book "Alien Information Theory"

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:10%
by Andrew Gallimore, which
states that DMT is likely

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:10%
a portal to another dimension.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So I thought,
well, look, if that

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.830 align:middle line:84%
is a ticket to another
dimension and my father thinks

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:84%
UFOs might be another
dimension, I need to go there.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.040 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And in that very
first DMT experience,

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I felt this presence, this
intelligence all around me.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And I asked, Are you what we
perceive to be UFOs and aliens?

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And I felt trillions of miles
of synapses and neurons firing.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.380 align:middle line:90%
And the answer came down to me.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
We can't explain in a way
that you would understand.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And my first thought
was, well, that's not no.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, well, if
there is this connective tissue

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:84%
between UFOs and DMT and maybe
ghosts and other phenomena,

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I could see how that
would be well beyond my ability

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.450 align:middle line:90%
And so I felt emboldened.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the right track here.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I've had confirmation
from what seems

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:84%
to be this universal
intelligence that there

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:84%
is a link between what we
altogether too often silo

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:90%
as different phenomena.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Altered states of
consciousness through

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.390 align:middle line:84%
the exploration of breath are
gaining attention in scientific

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Researchers are delving into how
methods like Wim Hof breathing

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.110 align:middle line:84%
might naturally influence
the brain's chemistry

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and its potential
to induce states

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.880 align:middle line:90%
akin to psychedelic experiences.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.720 align:middle line:10%
>> John Chavez from DMT
Quest, he brought a Wim Hof

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:10%
practitioner into the lab,
hooked him up to an EEG,

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.870 align:middle line:10%
and had him do this
Wim Hof breathing,

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:10%
which is belly breathing.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.730 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
hyperventilating

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:90%
for 75 breaths--

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:24.360 align:middle line:84%
to see whether there are
gamma spikes in the brainwaves

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:84%
because gamma
doesn't happen often.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And usually, when gamma
spikes are noticed,

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:84%
this is either near cardiac
arrest or it's near death

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:39.420 align:middle line:84%
experiences or it is
in didgeridoo playing.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:90%
It's in meditation.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Or it's in psychedelic
experiences.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you upregulate
DMT in the brain,

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:90%
you would notice gamma.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:84%
John Chavez right there showed
there is more room for study.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.030 align:middle line:84%
We need to find out whether
the Wim Hof breathing does

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:01.930 align:middle line:84%
upregulate DMT because that
means your breath is one

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.900 align:middle line:84%
of the prime ways that you
can upregulate DMT and have

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.645 align:middle line:84%
a mystical experience
without ingesting anything.

00:26:07.645 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:90%


00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I just made a film
with Aubrey Marcus,

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:84%
where he went into a
dark room for seven days.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
By day three, the pineal gland
stopped producing melatonin.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:10%
And there are theories that
when melatonin is used up,

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:10%
it starts producing
pinoline, which

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:10%
would allow for DMT to
build up inside the brain

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:10%
without getting metabolized
and broken down.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to ask ourselves,
does dark upregulate DMT?

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Does breath upregulate DMT?

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.785 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe our
ancestors were doing this.

00:26:44.785 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The varied experience is
triggered by different types

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.750 align:middle line:84%
of DMT, highlights its
appeal to a wide audience,

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:84%
from those seeking profound
healing to those exploring

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.410 align:middle line:90%
personal and scientific realms.

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Given its extensive
influence, who

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.650 align:middle line:84%
is the ideal candidate
for DMT experiences?

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And in what ways can it meet
various needs and goals?

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's two
paths with DMT,

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.280 align:middle line:84%
like those who do
need real healing,

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
both physical healing and
psychological healing.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:84%
It's good for depression
and anxiety as well.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:10%
But it's not just for healing
it's also for exploration.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Scientists can use it for
creative problem solving.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I think the applications are
across the board when it comes

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:90%
to working with this medicine.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:43.690 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> While DMT presents a spectrum
of possibilities for healing

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and exploration, it's crucial to
approach its use with awareness

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.100 align:middle line:90%
and caution.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's always important
to be aware of the potential

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.100 align:middle line:84%
that there could
be adverse effects.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.780 align:middle line:10%
These adverse effects or
challenging experiences

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:10%
can either be
avoided or supported

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:10%
in ways where we can actually
turn it into a really

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.490 align:middle line:10%
valuable experience.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:16.030 align:middle line:84%
These challenging
experiences are valuable

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
silver linings.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.050 align:middle line:84%
It's also a matter of having
a guide or a practitioner

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.170 align:middle line:84%
or an integrationist
who can support us

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:84%
in a healthy way
through the experience

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and through the
integration process

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:84%
because, ultimately, every
challenging experience presents

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.850 align:middle line:90%
an opportunity to grow.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Within the complex realm
of DMT's varied effects lies

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:49.370 align:middle line:84%
the profound potential of
mindful psychedelic exploration

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.310 align:middle line:84%
for personal and
societal evolution.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> We helped co-create that.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:84%
We helped change the laws, with
the intention that we could use

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:84%
these medicines to not only
heal physical injury or trauma

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and life experience but
heal collective trauma

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and maybe help people
think more clearly

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.190 align:middle line:84%
so that they can live their
lives to their fullest

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:14.450 align:middle line:84%
potential and then to bring
back possible solutions

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:19.100 align:middle line:84%
to real, global struggles
that we're holding.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But I truly believe
that that's possible.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm doing this work.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Medicine has taught
me that all is well.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:32.390 align:middle line:84%
It has given me a glimpse
into eternity, into divinity,

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:84%
into a place or a
state of being where

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.710 align:middle line:90%
there is no right and wrong.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:45.380 align:middle line:10%
>> If you take DMT and you have
this breakthrough experience,

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:50.870 align:middle line:10%
I'm quite sure it will be
the most profound experience

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:56.120 align:middle line:10%
of your life, almost
certainly enjoyable,

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.245 align:middle line:10%
and something that will change
the way you relate to reality.

00:30:00.245 --> 00:30:04.020 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The DMT journey
transcends imagination,

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.790 align:middle line:84%
breaking boundaries to reveal
new horizons of infinite

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:90%
possibilities.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.200 align:middle line:84%
These explorations
have the potential

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.520 align:middle line:84%
to transform one's sense of
self and deepen connections

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.170 align:middle line:84%
with the universe, highlighting
the boundless possibilities

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.440 align:middle line:90%
that lie within our reach.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.160 align:middle line:84%
