quantum mechanics matter given

that it's all little tiny
stuff, and who cares?

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:84%
There are three
possible answers.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.213 align:middle line:84%
From a practical point of view,
it doesn't make any difference

00:01:52.213 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you still have to go
to work and drive your car

a quantum mechanical effect.

important part is

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:84%
the third one,
which is essentially

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.280 align:middle line:90%
a philosophical issue.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Why are philosophers
so passionate

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.680 align:middle line:84%
about deconstruction, the
assumptions of the world?

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:90%
I finally got it.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I got it as a result of
looking at quantum mechanics

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and comparing it to
classical mechanics.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.090 align:middle line:84%
They present two very different
ways of thinking about the way

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:84%
that the world works
and about what we are.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So from a classical
perspective, we are machines.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:84%
In a machine, there's no room
for conscious experience.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
if a machine dies.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.280 align:middle line:90%
You can kill a machine.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.405 align:middle line:90%
You can throw it in a dump.

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
If that is the way
that the world is,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.033 align:middle line:84%
then people will
behave in that way.

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But there's another way of
thinking about the world, which

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
is suggested-- it's pointed
to by quantum mechanics, which

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the world is
not this clockwork thing,

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:90%
but it's more like an organism.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a highly interconnected
organismic thing

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.090 align:middle line:84%
of some type, which extends
through space and time.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
environment, what I think

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and the way that I behave,
has a much greater impact

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
not only on myself but
on the rest of the world,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.250 align:middle line:84%
than it would if it
was a classical world.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So from a very basic
point of view, having

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:90%
to do with morals and ethics.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:90%
What I think affects the world.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in a sense that's really
the key for why a worldview

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:90%
change is important.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.628 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about
the subatomic world,

00:03:38.628 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll talk about what
it's telling us about reality.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I want to tell
you about the subatomic world

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
is it's totally
a fantasy created

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:84%
by mad physicists
trying to figure out

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:84%
what the heck is
going on when they

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:90%
do these little experiments.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:84%
By little experiments, I mean
big energy in little spaces

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:90%
and little pieces of time.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
It gets pretty nutty at
that realm of things.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And so subatomic
physics was invented

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.370 align:middle line:90%
to try to figure that all out.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
We need a new
science down there.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's called quantum
physics, and it

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
is subject to a whole range
of debatable hypotheses,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.330 align:middle line:84%
thoughts, feelings, intuitions
as to what the heck is really

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
>> So on the one hand, you
had a theory which from

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:84%
the conceptual standpoint
was profoundly puzzling.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, from
the practical standpoint,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
was vastly more
successful than anything

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.860 align:middle line:90%
we had ever seen before.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of situation
that produces the tension

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:84%
that all of the
investigations of foundations

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
of quantum mechanics are
feeding off of since then.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one
hand, this is an acutely

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.840 align:middle line:84%
paradoxical, puzzling,
conceptually confusing theory.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
we have no option

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of throwing
it out or neglecting it,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:84%
because it is the most powerful
proven tool for predicting

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:84%
the behaviors of
physical systems

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
that we have ever
had in our hands.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>> The universe is very strange.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.980 align:middle line:84%
There seem to be two sets of
laws that govern the universe.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
In our everyday,
classical world,

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
meaning at roughly our
size and time scales,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.180 align:middle line:84%
things are described
by Newton's laws

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
of motion set down hundreds
and hundreds of years ago.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And they worked very well
for billiard balls and cannon

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:90%
balls and gravity.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.200 align:middle line:84%
However when we get
down to a small scale,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:84%
when we get down to
say the level of atoms,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:84%
a different set
of laws take over.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:84%
These are the quantum
laws, quantum theory,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:90%
quantum mechanics.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:10%
And at that level, particles
may be in multiple places

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:10%
They may behave
as waves, smeared

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:10%
out spatially and temporally.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:10%
They may be interconnected
over great distances.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:10%
They may be unified
into one quantum state,

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:10%
into one state governed
by one way function.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And the border
line, the threshold,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
this curtain between the quantum
world and the classical world

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:90%
is really mysterious.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.600 align:middle line:84%
It's called, sometimes, the
collapse of the wave function,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
because at the quantum world,
everything is in superposition

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:90%
of multiple possibilities.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And in the classical world,
these multiple possibilities

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.210 align:middle line:84%
seem to collapse to
particular definite choices.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So everything is in
one particular place.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> When electrons move
about the atomic nucleus,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:90%
they do so in orbits.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
You have seen such models of
the atom in high school books.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:90%
You can easily recall them.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But the subtle
part comes when we

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:84%
think of how does the
electron jump from one

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:84%
target to the other,
a jump that is

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
associated with the emission
of light from atoms.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:90%
Atoms emit light in the process.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But how does the electron jump
from one orbit to another?

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Niels Bohr was the first
one to point this out.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And these radical
electrons never

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
go through the intermediate,
intervening space.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Electrons never
traverse any space

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:90%
in making this transition.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.790 align:middle line:84%
They just are in
the higher orbit,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and then they are
in the lower orbit.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.210 align:middle line:90%
No space in between.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:90%
So how does one make the jump?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
If you think in terms of
continuity of movement,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:90%
you can't find answers to that.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So quantum, fundamentally
then, needs a discontinuity.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:84%
This word quantum-- originally,
it just meant quantity.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
In Latin, it just
means quantity.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the way we
use it in quantum physics.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:84%
From the beginning, we use the
word quantum in quantum physics

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle line:90%
to signify discreteness.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And now, signify a quantum
leap, a discontinuous movement.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Quantum mechanics guarantees
that the deeper you go,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:84%
the more energetic
nature becomes.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.280 align:middle line:84%
It's for this reason
that nuclear power

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
is a million times more
powerful than chemical power.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Because chemical
power represents

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:90%
the molecular manipulation.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Nuclear power emerges from
a nuclear manipulation,

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:84%
but the nucleus is a million
times smaller and a million

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:84%
times more fundamental and a
million times more powerful

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.910 align:middle line:90%
than the chemical level.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So the deeper you go,
the smaller you go,

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.940 align:middle line:84%
quantum mechanics says the
more dynamic you become.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:84%
The unified field exists
at the ultimate scale

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.140 align:middle line:84%
of the Planck scale, 10 to
the minus 33 centimeters.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The Planck scale is the
very smallest level of reality.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:84%
If we go down in scale,
we're at meters, centimeters.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:10%
If we go down to
atoms, they're 10

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.520 align:middle line:10%
to the minus eighth centimeters.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:10%
Keep going down
and down and down.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:10%
Space time is
smooth until we get

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:10%
to the basement floor,
the bottom level,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.140 align:middle line:10%
where there's a pattern.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.430 align:middle line:90%
There's a fabric, if you will.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind of
coarseness or irregularity.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's at-- what's
called the Planck scale,

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:84%
after Max Planck, the
German physicist--

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:84%
roughly 10 to the
minus 33 centimeters.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And the Planck time is 10
to the minus 43 seconds.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So things are very, very small
and happen very, very fast.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, despite the fact that
they're very, very small,

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:90%
space time is everywhere.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So the entire universe
is created at this level.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein's relativity says
when this fabric curves up,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:90%
it forms mass.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.248 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
matters is made of.

00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The notion that things that
we touch with our hands, feel,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.902 align:middle line:84%
are made of ideas or concepts
actually is probably an older

00:09:36.902 --> 00:09:38.235 align:middle line:90%
idea that we might have thought.

00:09:38.235 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's a difficult idea to
really grasp or get a hold of,

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.030 align:middle line:84%
but let me try to
explain it this way.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:84%
When we began to look at
small corners of space

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and little pieces
of time, we began

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:84%
to see that the objects
that we discovered

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:84%
in these regions
of space and time

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:84%
weren't just
persistently existing.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.490 align:middle line:84%
They were kind of popping,
like bubbles in bubble wrap.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Pop, pop, pop.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:90%
On and off, on and off.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And in order to explain
that, we wondered

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:84%
what they were doing when they
weren't appearing as pops.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:90%
What were they before that?

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Then we did more
refined experiments,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and we found that we could take
objects and let them interact,

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:84%
then fly apart, and
then measure something

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:90%
about one of the objects.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And we'd find that the
other object would also

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:84%
change at the same time that
the first object was even

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.830 align:middle line:90%
looked at.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was if something
popped over here-- instantly,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.870 align:middle line:84%
the other one would pop, whereas
if we hadn't popped this one,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.670 align:middle line:90%
this one will just pop randomly.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So how could pop one
be connected to pop two

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:90%
when they weren't separated?

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So this gradually
led into some notions

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
that there was an invisible
connection between everything.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Physicists give this a name.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.150 align:middle line:84%
They call it entanglement,
or we can now

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.680 align:middle line:84%
speak of it in terms of a
state or an invisible state.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
We call it a state vector
or a quantum wave function,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:90%
because it seems wavy.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.890 align:middle line:84%
It seems spread out over
space and time, rather than

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.990 align:middle line:84%
concentrically localized
in one place at one time.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:84%
However, this wave
function isn't just

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.390 align:middle line:84%
a wave of matter like an
ocean wave or a sound wave

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.310 align:middle line:90%
or any kind of wave of matter.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a wave of possibility.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a kind of thought wave.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And because it is a wave of
thought or possibility or not

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:90%
matter, it's invisible to us.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
But we can't explain
what we do see

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:84%
as matter in these small
corners of space and time

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:84%
unless we picture that these
matter particles somehow

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.630 align:middle line:84%
come out from, or emerge
from these thought

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:84%
wave patterns which
are invisible to us.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Quantum mechanics is
really the play and display

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.400 align:middle line:84%
of information, the play
and display of potentiality.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Waves of information, waves
of potential electron--

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's important,
the word potential.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the
world of electrons.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the world of
potential electrons.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:84%
But you have to ask the
question, waves of what,

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:90%
really?

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:84%
What is the field
that is waving?

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Is it the ocean?

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a universal ocean, an
ocean of pure potentiality,

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.990 align:middle line:84%
an ocean of abstract
potential existence.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:84%
We call it the unified field
or super strength field.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.116 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're made of.

00:12:37.116 --> 00:12:41.580 align:middle line:84%

It's very difficult to
wrap your mind around that,

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
but Erwin Schrodinger
said-- he's

one of the founders
of quantum mechanics--

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.570 align:middle line:84%
that entanglement, which is
this idea of this connectivity,

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:84%
is not just a property
of quantum mechanics.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:90%
It's the property.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:84%
It's the property of quantum
mechanics that makes it

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.440 align:middle line:84%
very, very strange,
and it doesn't

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:10.050 align:middle line:84%
seem to fit in with our ordinary

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.930 align:middle line:90%

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Atoms make up molecules.

Molecules make up materials,

But atoms, actually,
are mostly empty.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, if this ball
were the nucleus of an atom--

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
a proton and a hydrogen
atom for example--

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:84%
then the electron
circling this, which

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:84%
would describe the outer
limits of that atom,

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:84%
would be out by that
mountain over there,

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle line:90%
roughly 20 miles away.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And everything in
between is empty.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the universe
is mostly empty.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:84%
However when we go down
in scale, in the emptiness

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:84%
we eventually come to
a fundamental level

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:45.970 align:middle line:84%
of space time geometry, the fine
basement level of the universe

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.590 align:middle line:90%
where there's information.

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:90%
There's a pattern.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Planck scale, and it's

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:90%
the fabric of the universe.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And at that level,
there's information that's

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:90%
been there since the Big Bang.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So most of the universe, even
of matter, is actually empty.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people think
that the vacuum is empty.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:84%
But for internal
self consistency

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
of quantum mechanics
and relativity theory,

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:18.480 align:middle line:84%
there is required to
be the equivalent of 10

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:90%
to the 94 grams of mass energy.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%

Now that's a huge number, but
what does it mean practically?

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Practically, if I can assume
that the universe is flat--

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and more and more,
astronomical data

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:84%
is showing it's
pretty darn flat--

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:84%
if I can assume that,
then if I take the volume

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.870 align:middle line:84%
or take the vacuum within
a single hydrogen atom,

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.060 align:middle line:84%
that's about 10 to the
minus 23 cubic centimeters.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.920 align:middle line:84%
If I take that amount of vacuum
and I take the latent energy

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.100 align:middle line:84%
in that, there is a
trillion times more energy

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:84%
there than in all of the
mass of all of the stars

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and all of the planets out
to 20 billion light years.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:90%
That's big.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:84%
That's big, and if
consciousness allows

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:21.099 align:middle line:84%
you to control even a
small fraction of that,

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:84%
creating a Big
Bang is no problem.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.702 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.702 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Organizations like NASA,
British Aerospace are all

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:84%
trying to tap into
this incredible,

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:90%
unimaginably large energy sea.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And they feel if
they can tap this,

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
we can travel to
different galaxies.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So they understand
that in empty space,

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:84%
there is this
unbelievable energy.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>> When you begin to
really grasp this,

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:84%
you begin to grasp the enormity
of the energy that would be

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
involved in going
down this rabbit hole.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:84%
What is available for
us to use in the future

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.370 align:middle line:90%
to take us to the stars?

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:04.580 align:middle line:84%
The issue is we are perturbing
this with consciousness.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.050 align:middle line:84%
With directed consciousness
and intention,

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
we are changing
things at the vacuum

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:84%
level which then allow us to
access a new level of physics.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So we can do that at
that level, not so much

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:90%
at the atom molecule level.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.750 align:middle line:90%
That's a secondary effect.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So we were already
doing it, in essence.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:84%
We're already getting into the
rabbit hole by using intention.

Quantum mechanics is
just the play and display

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:90%
of potentiality.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> If you put it that there
is an intangible world that

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:84%
affects the tangible
world of our experience,

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and if you then say that's
what quantum mechanics says--

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.578 align:middle line:84%
and granted, that's
a fair way of trying

00:18:49.578 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:84%
to put into English
something which is very, very

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:90%
difficult to grasp--

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:57.440 align:middle line:84%
but it then leads quite
naturally to the conclusion

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:84%
that quantum mechanics says that
there is a spiritual world that

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:90%
makes this choice.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:84%
There is another world
that is intangible

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:84%
that affects and influences
the physical world.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And really, while that
statement might be true,

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:84%
quantum mechanics absolutely
does not say that.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:23.450 align:middle line:84%
That intangibility, however,
is itself the bedrock

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:90%
of physical reality.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:84%
It may be intangible,
but it is--

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:84%
we can't really say what
it is or why it's there.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.747 align:middle line:84%
But it is, in fact, the most
fundamental feature of matter.

00:19:38.747 --> 00:19:40.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can say, well, if
it's a feature of matter,

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:90%
that's not intangible.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.992 align:middle line:84%
I mean, matter is the
most tangible of things.

00:19:44.992 --> 00:19:46.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these are word games.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter is that
matter is not what we have long

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.260 align:middle line:90%
thought it to be.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:84%
To the scientists,
matter has always

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:84%
been thought of as
sort of the ultimate

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.890 align:middle line:84%
in that which is
static and predictable.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And the more you understand the
material aspect of something,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
the more perfectly
predictable it is.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.020 align:middle line:84%
What quantum
mechanics illustrates

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.915 align:middle line:84%
is that, that is
simply not true.

slightly differently,

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
these equations entail that for

And people usually
chop these asymmetries

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.930 align:middle line:90%
up into three different levels.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Level one, there
are all sorts of

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:90%
ordinary physical processes--

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
ice melting, smoke spreading
out in a room, people

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:84%

old, so on and so forth--

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.160 align:middle line:84%
that we never see
happening in reverse.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Two, we have a very different
kind of epistemic access

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.400 align:middle line:84%
to the past than we
do to the future.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.870 align:middle line:84%
That is that the ease with
which we can know things

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.960 align:middle line:84%
about the past and the way in
which we come to know things

about the past and the detail
with which we can know things

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.650 align:middle line:84%
about the past is utterly
different than the ease

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and the access and the detail
that we have to the future.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:58.720 align:middle line:84%

of the fundamental equations

these three asymmetries

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:90%
are extremely mysterious.

that play an incredibly
fundamental role

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:90%
in every second of our lives.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's been a puzzle hanging
over physics for a long time.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Where does this asymmetry
come from if not

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:90%
the equations of motion?

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.130 align:middle line:84%
The equations of
motion are supposed

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.220 align:middle line:84%
to be the whole story
about how the world works.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But in that story,
these asymmetries

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.480 align:middle line:90%
don't show up at all.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet, these asymmetries
are profound, ubiquitous,

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:84%
inescapable features of
every second of our lives

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.150 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.235 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most
unpalatable ideas still,

00:25:52.235 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:84%
in spite of the fact that
quantum physics has been around

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:84%
a long time, is the possibility
or the notion that the future

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:84%
can have a causative
effect on the present.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:84%
We believe that the past
can have a causative effect

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:06.820 align:middle line:90%
on the present.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:90%
I hold the ball.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.030 align:middle line:90%
I drop it, it falls.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Cause, effect-- when
it hits the ground.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.370 align:middle line:84%
But could the
ground be the cause

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.835 align:middle line:84%
of my dropping the ball
in the first place?

00:26:17.835 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It's only in conscious
experience that it seems that

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.140 align:middle line:90%
we move forward in time.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:84%
In quantum theory, you can
also go backwards in time.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
suggestion that processes

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
in the brain related to
consciousness project backwards

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.550 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the late
1970s a neurophysiologist

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.630 align:middle line:84%
at University of
California San Francisco

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:84%
named Ben Libet did some
very famous experiments.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:84%
What Libet did
was study patients

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
who were having neurosurgery
on their brains,

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.753 align:middle line:84%
with their brains exposed,
while they were awake.

00:26:48.753 --> 00:26:50.170 align:middle line:84%
They were given a
local anesthetic

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.300 align:middle line:84%
to numb the area of
the skull and scalp

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:90%
to access their brains.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were awake, and Ben
would talk to these people.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So for example, what he did was
stimulate their little finger

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and look at the part
of the sensory cortex

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.010 align:middle line:84%
on the opposite side
that was related to that,

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.380 align:middle line:84%
record from it electrically,
and ask the patient

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.710 align:middle line:84%
when he or she felt the
stimulus on the little finger.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And he would also stimulate at
that particular area of cortex.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Now what you would
think would be

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.180 align:middle line:84%
that if you stimulate
the little finger,

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:84%
it takes a finite period of
time to get to the opposite side

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.910 align:middle line:90%
of the cortex.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So the patient would report
it a fraction of a second

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.135 align:middle line:90%
later after the stimulus.

00:27:27.135 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you
stimulated directly,

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:84%
the patient would
report it immediately.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.960 align:middle line:90%
He found just the opposite.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.690 align:middle line:84%
When you stimulated
the little finger,

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:90%
the patient felt it immediately.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And when he stimulated
directly on the cortex,

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.473 align:middle line:90%
there was a delay.

00:27:40.473 --> 00:27:41.890 align:middle line:84%
After sorting
through all the data

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:43.755 align:middle line:84%
and repeating this
over and over,

00:27:43.755 --> 00:27:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Libet came to the conclusion
that somehow the brain

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:84%
was projecting information
backwards in time.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So it did take a
finite amount of time

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.780 align:middle line:84%
to get to the sensory
cortex, but the brain

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.970 align:middle line:84%
projected it
backwards in time so

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.440 align:middle line:84%
that the conscious
perception was

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.340 align:middle line:84%
that the stimulus was felt when
the pinch actually occurred.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been some studies
which have shown that when

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:84%
people are beginning to move
a hand or beginning to say

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.810 align:middle line:84%
something, there's actually
activity in the brain

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
in certain nerve
cells of the brain,

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.940 align:middle line:84%
even before they become
consciously aware of what

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to do.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>> In baseball, scientists
showed that if you study how

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.290 align:middle line:84%
a batter can hit a pitch
coming at 100 miles an hour--

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:26.350 align:middle line:84%
considering the recognition,
the visual processing,

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:84%
the motor response, the
reflexes, synaptic delays--

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.180 align:middle line:90%
it's impossible.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.760 align:middle line:90%
That was his conclusion.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.770 align:middle line:90%
How could it be accomplished?

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, one possibility is that
as the batter is standing there,

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.530 align:middle line:84%
the ball comes across
the plate and the batter

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle line:84%
sees where the ball is,
recognizes it, and decides

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.290 align:middle line:84%
where to swing by
the time the ball

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:84%
is already in the
catcher's mitt.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.350 align:middle line:84%
But the information is
projected backwards in time

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:55.390 align:middle line:84%
so that he or she swings
at the previous time

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:84%
when the ball is just
coming across the plate.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.890 align:middle line:84%
This could be
happening all the time

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.863 align:middle line:84%
in our normal everyday
consciousness.

00:29:01.863 --> 00:29:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
other experiments

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.155 align:middle line:90%
that have shown this.

00:29:04.155 --> 00:29:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Dick Berman and Dean Radin
have done some experiments

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:09.970 align:middle line:84%
where a subject sits
at a computer screen

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and watches a series of images,
which may be somewhat bland

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.390 align:middle line:84%
or may have highly
emotional content.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And they just study their
galvanic skin response

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.450 align:middle line:90%
as a means of emotion.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.043 align:middle line:84%
And they vary the timing of when
the pictures going to occur.

00:29:25.043 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So the subject doesn't
know exactly when

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:27.760 align:middle line:90%
it's going to occur.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.190 align:middle line:84%
What they find is
that, not surprisingly,

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.060 align:middle line:84%
the emotional pictures give
a much greater response.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.910 align:middle line:84%
But both the emotional and
the unemotional responses

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.830 align:middle line:84%
show up a half a
second to two seconds

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:41.980 align:middle line:84%
before the stimulus actually
occurs on the screen.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And a fellow named Chester
Wiley replicated this, not only

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.590 align:middle line:90%
in humans but in worms.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So this may be possibly a
very widespread phenomenon

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.290 align:middle line:90%
of backwards projection in time.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.540 align:middle line:84%
The only explanation is
through quantum physics.

>> Pat Price was a
fantastic remote viewer.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was supposed to
draw where his traveler was

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.290 align:middle line:90%
going, as usual.

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And he drew two tanks
and a swimming pool.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And when the investigators
looked at it,

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.740 align:middle line:84%
the scientist said Pat
must've just got it

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.460 align:middle line:84%
wrong this time, because he was
right about the swimming pool.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.270 align:middle line:84%
They had sent their
traveling partner

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:22.600 align:middle line:84%
to the municipal swimming
pool in Palo Alto.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And they said Pat just
got it wrong this time.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Months later, one
of the scientists

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:33.970 align:middle line:84%
received something from the
Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And it had images of
the municipal swimming

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.220 align:middle line:90%
pool 50 years earlier.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And what they saw was
the swimming pool,

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:84%
but two tanks exactly
where Pat had drawn them.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And so what Pat's
mind had done was not

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:53.740 align:middle line:84%
to see what the swimming
pool was in present time.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.015 align:middle line:84%

it was 50 years ago.

professor, was, I think,

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:16.550 align:middle line:84%
one of the prime inventors

parallel universes and time

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.910 align:middle line:84%

paradoxes now of time travel.

before they have
you and come back,

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're still
alive and no paradox.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And even to explain
that is difficult to do,

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.950 align:middle line:84%
but nevertheless, put them
in a parallel universe

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:38.147 align:middle line:90%
and it's no problem.

So these are the
kinds of things we're

doing in physics right now.

00:32:22.588 --> 00:32:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you know this shit?

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:28.588 align:middle line:90%
>> I read "Dr. Quantum" comics.

00:32:28.588 --> 00:32:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks it's just kid's
stuff, but I know it's real.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:34.356 align:middle line:84%
It's how I do my
magic on the court.

00:32:34.356 --> 00:32:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yo!

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.580 align:middle line:84%
What they taught us in
school isn't really the way

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:43.710 align:middle line:84%
it is, and our senses
are playing tricks on us.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:47.280 align:middle line:84%
We've just got to wonder,
what is this reality that we

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.500 align:middle line:90%
find ourselves in?

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics says it's all
just waves of information.

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Do I believe that?

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.090 align:middle line:90%
I hope so!

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:00.727 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.727 --> 00:33:01.527 align:middle line:90%
Yikes!

00:33:01.527 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It's how I do my
magic on the court.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I always choose the
wonder boy first.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Quantum says
everybody's got it.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.860 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's doing it.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And doing it constantly,
each and every time you look.
