>> Do you have any
favorite rabbit holes?

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you can
start with the brain.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.555 align:middle line:84%
And most people look
at the brain operating

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:84%
as a neural network,
as a bunch of neurons--

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.520 align:middle line:90%
100 billion or however many--

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:84%
talking to each other like
nodes or switches in a computer,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:84%
with synapses
being the switches.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And that gives rise
to consciousness.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that can
explain consciousness.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>> The brain is meat.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the mind.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Meat of the human
nervous system.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Has the remarkable capability
of reflecting consciousness

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.265 align:middle line:90%
because it is so designed.

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't create
consciousness, it reflects it.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Which gives us a unique
advantage over other objects

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:84%
like rocks, which appear so
inert because they don't have

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:84%
this ability to
reflect what is there

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:84%
at the deeper levels
of nature, which

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:90%
is pervasive consciousness.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So I feel like, God exists
not so much in the brain,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:84%
as in the body mind throughout
our entire psychosomatic

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:84%
But if I were going to choose
the most interesting piece,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:84%
it would have to be the
place of highest evolution.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Once again, your frontal cortex.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And you really see this
very methodical development

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
of more and more frontal
cortex as you progress up

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:90%
the evolutionary scale.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And another role of
the frontal cortex is--

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say
suppress emotions,

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.660 align:middle line:84%
but, kind of, slow down
the choices around it.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, consciousness
is the tip of the iceberg

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.140 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Because most of
what the brain does

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
is subconscious
or proto-conscious

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.413 align:middle line:90%
or pre-conscious.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And only a small
part of the brain

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
that is involved in actual
consciousness at any one time.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.017 align:middle line:84%
But the rest of it is
important for the latitude

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:03.600 align:middle line:84%
of the possibilities
of consciousness.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is understanding all
this stuff about the brain

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.470 align:middle line:90%
important?

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, studying the
brain isn't important.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Studying consciousness through
the brain to produce mind

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:84%
When we can understand
the functioning

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
brain or a brain in action
or a brain in motion,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:90%
we call that mind.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And when we can gather
information-- for example,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
when a person is
person is anxious

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and their basal ganglia
and our brain scan

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.570 align:middle line:84%
is hot because their
idle is running high.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Or a person who has
problems concentrating,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:84%
that their frontal
lobe doesn't work--

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.280 align:middle line:84%
it gives us enough
information to tell us

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
when a person's brain isn't
working, they're not working.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.550 align:middle line:90%
It's the bottom line.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So the brain is the
instrument that we

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
use to facilitate consciousness
on this level to produce mind

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.320 align:middle line:90%
to be able to learn and evolve.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.830 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk about
we're just a piece of meat.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk about
this as being an illusion.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:84%
But you see, we're not
evolved to that point

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:84%
to be able to embrace
that understanding.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we still
experience cold.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.330 align:middle line:90%
We still experience pain.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
We still experience
sensation and hunger.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's not an illusion.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Because we haven't
gotten the training

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
to be able to manipulate
reality to that extent.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:84%
That's something
way down the line.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But we're just beginning
to stand up and accept

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:90%
an unconventional point of view.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And that unconventional
point of view

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
gives people the
opportunity to step

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:84%
outside the
boundaries and the way

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:84%
which they routinely
and automatically fire

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:90%
those circuits.

emotional human beings.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:90%
That's not a bad thing.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
It only becomes
a limitation when

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
we keep accessing
those same emotions

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and those same attitudes
on a daily basis

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:84%

of our change or evolution

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:90%

day?

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
What we're actually
saying is, I have

to reconfirm who I am

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:90%
I have to do this.

I have to go here.

quite an enormous

and perceptions.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:84%
It challenges your

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It challenges even your
emotional agreements.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, people have agreements
with people and things

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:90%
and places and times and events.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And all those agreements
have some chemical makeup

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:84%
that supports who they are as
an individual, as an identity,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:90%
as a personality.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%

scan, it's kind of depressing.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.737 align:middle line:84%
You see many different
areas of the personality,

electrical activity that

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.580 align:middle line:90%
seems to have no coordination.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.523 align:middle line:84%
It's like a symphony
with no conductor.

00:05:51.523 --> 00:05:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden, if
the conductor steps up

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:84%
to the plate, the whole
brain would function

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:90%
in unity and coherence.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:84%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a part of the
brain called the hypothalamus.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And the hypothalamus is
like a little mini factory.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And it is a place that
assembles certain chemicals that

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:84%
matches certain emotions
that we experience.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And those particular
chemicals are called peptides.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:84%
They're small, chain
amino acid sequences.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:84%
They body's basically,
a carbon unit

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
that makes about 20 different
amino acids, all together

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.270 align:middle line:84%
to formulate its
physical structure.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:84%
The hypothalamus is
actually a structure

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:90%
that's a little bit more--

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
right below the
thalamus, usually right

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:90%
in this area here.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
You can see it as a little
bit of a yellow area.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.415 align:middle line:84%
And a little later
on, it'll actually--

00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
we'll show how it turns on
during these experiences.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.320 align:middle line:84%
But the hypothalamus is a main
controller of body functions.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.660 align:middle line:84%
It regulates all of our
basic body functions-- heart

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:90%
rate, blood pressure.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:84%
It helps to regulate
most of our hormones

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:84%
including our sex hormones,
stress hormones, and so forth.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:84%
It helps to regulate
our immune function.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is the key regulator of
the autonomic nervous system.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>> In the hypothalamus, we take
small chain proteins called

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.055 align:middle line:84%
peptides and we assemble them
into certain neuropeptides

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:84%
or neurohormones that match
the emotional states that we

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:90%
experience on a daily basis.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's chemicals
for anger, and there's

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
chemicals for
sadness, and there's

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.250 align:middle line:90%
chemicals for victimization.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.050 align:middle line:90%
There's chemicals for lust.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:84%

experience that emotional state

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:84%
in our body or in our

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
will immediately
assemble the peptide,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:84%
that then releases it
through the pituitary

into the bloodstream.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:84%

and working through the

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.210 align:middle line:84%

so many different types

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:90%
of therapies.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.900 align:middle line:84%
There's therapies
that are geared more

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.650 align:middle line:84%
at looking at emotions, more
at looking at cognitions,

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:84%
more looking at
behavioral ways you

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
can help yourself to
get out of a pattern.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think, again, looking
at the human organism,

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:84%
as every living system,
as a integrated whole,

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:84%
that if there are ways of
integrating cognition, emotion,

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
behavior, physiology in
your approach to change,

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
then that's what's ultimately
going to be most helpful.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are a variety
of techniques that

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:90%
can help a person to do that.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.750 align:middle line:84%
See, I think what you want
here is an answer, what

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:90%
is this thing a person can do.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
there is a thing.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
process that somebody who

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:84%
is in that kind of a pattern,
there is a process of things

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that person has to go through
before they can really

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:84%
do that in a consistent
way, repeatedly,

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:84%
so that actually
they've relearned

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.480 align:middle line:90%
a new way of behaving.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a human propensity
for the mind to consistently

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.550 align:middle line:90%
move back to the past.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.260 align:middle line:84%
That's a natural
mechanism that's

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:90%
been developed over eons.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.700 align:middle line:84%
When we have a new experience,
whatever that experience is,

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:84%
that experience allows
circuits and connections

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:84%
in the brain to
begin to formulate.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.610 align:middle line:84%
As those connections formulate,
they release chemicals,

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and those chemicals
make a feeling.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So emotions and feelings
are the end product

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.350 align:middle line:90%
of every experience.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And feelings and emotions help
us to remember experiences

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:84%
We know where we were
on 9/11 because there

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
was a feeling that was
associated with it.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, what typically
happens for most people

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:84%
when they have a novel
or a new experience,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.510 align:middle line:84%
they repeat that experience
over in their mind again.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural propensity.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we do that
is because if we can fire

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.680 align:middle line:84%
those circuits over
and over again,

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:84%
by the act of repetition,
we can remember them.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.470 align:middle line:90%
So we learn from an experience.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Learning is making
new connections.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Remembering is maintaining
those connections.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a natural order
in which we review something

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:90%
in order to remember it.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem is,
with most people,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:84%
is that they become so
immersed in the feelings

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:84%
of certain experiences
is that feelings

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:90%
become the means of thinking.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words, feelings
determine their thinking.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.190 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, we only
are living from the past,

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:84%
because by definition,
feelings are

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle line:90%
associated to some past event.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So if we determine
our future based

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:84%
on a feeling, what
we're really saying

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.640 align:middle line:84%
is I'm trying to create
a future situation

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.350 align:middle line:90%
from a past situation.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And invariably, we will
always continuously recreate

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:90%
the future based on the past.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And that future will
be more of the past.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.670 align:middle line:90%
So what will we see?

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
People who are wired
in victimization,

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:84%
people who are
wired in suffering,

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:84%
people who are wired
in their insecurity.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And the feelings become the
barometer of their reality.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Then in their future
experience, they

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:84%
could only create reality
based on how they're wired.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.850 align:middle line:84%
They'll recreate the
victimization in their life

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:90%
because it's all that they know.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.950 align:middle line:84%
In order to create
a new future, we

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.980 align:middle line:84%
have to leave the feelings
of the past behind.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:84%
We have to abandon the
way in which feeling

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:90%
is the means of thinking.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we're able
to do that, we're

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
breaking the association in
the neurological networks that

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
are attached to that thinking
and feeling mechanism

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:84%
so that we're focusing on
an abstraction, an idea,

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:84%
a concept, a dream that
we haven't yet experienced

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
because it has no emotion,
but it's something

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:84%
that we would like
to experience.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And that process of being able
to abandon the means of feeling

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
for a future potential
is the greatest test

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:90%
for the human being.

>> Our experiences
color what we know.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:32.510 align:middle line:84%
So there is no completely
objective appraisal of anything

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
because our appraisal
of everything

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
has to do with our previous
experiences and our emotions.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything has an
emotional weighting to it.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%

>> Science knows now that
the hypothalamus makes

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
neuropeptides, and those
neuropeptides are strong

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:90%
chemicals.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It was in the early '70s that
Saul Snider and myself first

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:21.080 align:middle line:84%
identified opiate receptors
in the brain and developed

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:90%
a method for measuring them.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, people said,
hey, what are they doing there?

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Why would we have receptors?

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Why would God put
receptors in our brain?

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:84%
What would be the
point of all this?

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.182 align:middle line:84%
And then people
started to say, well,

00:16:36.182 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:84%
there must be an
endogenous ligand.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And ligand is an
interesting word.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the same root
word as religion, ligare,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:90%
that which binds.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And people started to
look, and before long, they

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:59.690 align:middle line:84%
found a peptide, which is
called endorphin or enkephalin.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of science around it

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of
interesting information

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.822 align:middle line:84%
upon what systems in
your body it regulates.

00:17:06.822 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's where it came from.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And then following that,
the Valium receptor was big.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:84%
People found it and looked
for endogenous Valium.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And now marijuana receptors and
endogenous marijuana is hot.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.220 align:middle line:84%
There's enough
data now to suggest

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:84%
that no psychoactive
drug works unless it's

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.820 align:middle line:84%
binding to a receptor
that's normally

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:90%
meant for an internal juice.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean I can make
LSD if I wanted to?

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, you
do, but you know,

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:84%
it won't be
chemically identical.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Time magazine
had a mistake there.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:84%
They said that
morphine was chemically

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:90%
related to endorphins.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's not true, because
morphine is a different kind

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:90%
of chemical structure.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Endorphins are a peptide.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But they both fit into
the same receptor.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So LSD and all the
psychoactive mushrooms

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and different analogs, they
hit a variety of receptors,

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.330 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not their
chemical structure,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
it's having the right shape
and electrostatic charge

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:90%
to fit into the receptor.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's the story of
the peptide and the cell.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:84%
The peptides find the
receptors and dock onto them

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:90%
and stay attached.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Then they come off, and then
they can come back on again.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And while they're there,
they are changing the cell.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.350 align:middle line:84%
A receptor that has a
peptide sitting in it

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.960 align:middle line:84%
sets off a whole cascade
of biochemical events,

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:84%
some of which changes
nucleus of the cell.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:10%
One of the sources of evidence
that the molecules of emotion

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:10%
are the molecules
of emotion is we

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:10%
have the same identical
molecules in the simplest

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:10%
even one-celled creatures.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And so emotions are preserved
throughout evolution.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, endorphins are
in yeast and tetrahymena,

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:90%
a simple, one-celled organism.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So pleasure is so
basic, and we were

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:90%
designed to run on pleasure.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
addicted to pleasure,

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and our brain is set up to
record pleasure and seek

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:90%
pleasure.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
final endpoint, is

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:90%
to find pleasure and avoid pain.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.758 align:middle line:84%
And that's what drives
human evolution.

up to the brain, saying--

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Hungry.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>> --we haven't
gotten our fix today.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to start selling
impressions to the brain,

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and the brain is going to
start to formulate imagery.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.100 align:middle line:84%
It's going to sound
like voices in our head.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm hungry.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>> To think of a reason
why we should be depressed,

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:84%
think of a reason why
we should be confused,

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
think of a reason for
our own suffering.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And the body is going to be
telling the brain that it's not

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:84%
getting its chemical
need, chemical needs met.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And so the brain will
then activate and start

is a very powerful word today.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And I conclude that it is one
of the most important words

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:46.950 align:middle line:84%
of all ages because it fits
into the concept of regeneration

no one here or in your

if you can't control
your emotional state,

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.642 align:middle line:90%

And his work has shown
that so much of addiction

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:90%
is really learning.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's really ironic that
things that seem unpleasant,

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:84%
like anger, to me--
you know, I don't like
