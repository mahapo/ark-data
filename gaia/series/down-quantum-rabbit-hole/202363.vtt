00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And here we are, the
granddaddy of all quantum

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.730 align:middle line:84%
weirdness, the infamous
double slit experiment.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The first people who
did these experiments--

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and these experiments
have-- experiments,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.150 align:middle line:84%
crude experiments of
this kind were first

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:84%
performed almost 50 years
ago, or more, 60 years ago.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Those people were flabbergasted.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>> To understand
this experiment,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:84%
we first need to
see how particles,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.110 align:middle line:90%
or little balls of matter, act.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
If we randomly shoot a
small object, say a marble,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
at the screen, we see a
pattern on the back wall

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.720 align:middle line:84%
where they went through
the slit and hit.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we add a
second slit, we would

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:84%
expect to see a second band
duplicated to the right.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Now let's look at waves.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:84%
The waves hit the
slit and radiate out,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:84%
striking the back wall
with the most intensity

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:90%
directly in line with the slit.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.440 align:middle line:84%
The line of brightness
on the back screen

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:90%
shows that intensity.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.260 align:middle line:84%
This is similar to the
line the marbles make.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But when we had the second slit,
something different happens.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:84%
If the top of one wave meets
the bottom of another wave,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:90%
they cancel each other out.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So now there is an interference
pattern on the back wall.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Places where the two tops meet
are the highest intensity,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:90%
the bright lines.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And where they cancel,
there is nothing.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So when we throw things, that
is, matter, through two slits,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:90%
we get this, two bands of hits.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And with waves, we get
an interference pattern

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:90%
of many bands.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Good, so far.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.385 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go quantum.

00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> This is just to break
down your prejudice that says

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:90%
a particle is a particle.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to--
you've got to understand

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%
it's a particle and a wave.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>> An electron is a
tiny, tiny bit of matter,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:90%
like a tiny marble.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's fire a stream
through one slit.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:84%
It behaves just like the
marble, a single band.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So if we shoot these tiny
bits through two slits,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
we should get, like
the marbles, two bands.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:90%
An interference pattern.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
We fired electrons, tiny
bits of matter through.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.060 align:middle line:84%
But we get a pattern like
waves, not like little marbles.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
How could pieces of matter
create an interference pattern

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:90%
like a wave?

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't make sense.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to understand,
it's a particle and a wave.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Now that you've taken
that leap, let's

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.280 align:middle line:84%
get one step closer
to the reality.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.680 align:middle line:90%
It ain't either of those either.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's both at the same time.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>> But physicists are clever.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.020 align:middle line:84%
They thought, maybe
those little balls

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:84%
are bouncing off each other
and creating that pattern.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So they decide to shoot
electrons through one

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
There is no way they could
interfere with each other.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.970 align:middle line:84%
But after an hour of this,
the same interference pattern

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:90%
is seen to emerge.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:90%
The conclusion is inescapable.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.410 align:middle line:84%
The single electron
leaves as a particle,

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:84%
becomes a wave of potentials,
goes through both slits,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and interferes with itself to
hit the wall, like a particle.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.810 align:middle line:84%
But mathematically,
it's even stranger.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:84%
It goes through both slits
and it goes through neither.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through just one and
it goes through just the other.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
All of these possibilities
are in superposition

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.080 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> We did these experiments,
and we got certain results.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And in the light
of these results,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:84%
we asked a question
of the form, gee,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:84%
which path could the electron
have taken through this two

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.297 align:middle line:90%
paths apparatus?

00:04:43.297 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And if there are two
options like that,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
it's just a matter of
standard classical logic,

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:84%
there are four logical
possibilities, A, B, both,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:90%
neither.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
We went through those
possibilities one by one

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and designed an
experiment in each case

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.850 align:middle line:90%
to test that possibility.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And the answer in each of
the four cases was negative.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go through route
A. How do we know that?

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Because when we put in a total
of nothing box in route A,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:84%
it has an effect
on this particle.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:84%
The total of nothing boxes don't
have any effect on particles

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.380 align:middle line:90%
that pass through them.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go through route
B for the same reason.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go
through both routes.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Because if we stopped the
experiment in the middle,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
we always find it either
on one route or the other,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.820 align:middle line:90%
but not both.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
take neither route,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
because if we just
block up the two routes

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and leave everything else
open, nothing gets through.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So we can systematically,
piece by piece,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
eliminate all of the four
logical possibilities, given

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:84%
the assumption that it makes
sense to ask the question,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:90%
which route did it take.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
That's how we're forced
into a position, gee,

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:90%
the only thing left to do here--

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:84%
it's analogous to,
think about the case

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
of inquiring into the marital
status of the number 5.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Somebody says, gee, is
the number 5 married?

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.750 align:middle line:84%
You say, no, that's not
the right thing to say.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.110 align:middle line:84%
The guy says, I see,
number 5 is a bachelor.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
You say, no, that's
not right either.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Guy says, well,
what else is there?

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:84%
You say, look, the
deal about the number 5

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:84%
is, it's not married, it's
not a bachelor, that's

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:90%
not a logical contradiction.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.990 align:middle line:84%
The trouble here is
that the whole question

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:84%
of the marital status
of the number 5

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.560 align:middle line:84%
is a question that can't
sensibly be raised.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're finding
out about these particles.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:90%
We say, did it take route A?

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.640 align:middle line:84%
We can eliminate
it experimentally.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Did it take route B?

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:84%
We can eliminate
that experimentally.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Did it take both?

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:90%
We can eliminate that.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Did it take neither?

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:90%
We can eliminate that.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:84%
All that leaves us with
is going this route

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.070 align:middle line:90%
that we go with the number 5.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Although in this case,
it's astonishing.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:84%
With the case of the
number 5, it was easy.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.370 align:middle line:84%
What this must be telling
us is that it somehow

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:84%
fails to make
sense even to raise

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.230 align:middle line:84%
the question in a
situation like this,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.780 align:middle line:84%
which route did
the particle take?

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Physicists were
completely baffled by this,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:36.700 align:middle line:84%
so they decided to peek and
see which slit it actually goes

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
They put a measuring
device by one slit

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to see which one it went
through and let it fly.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But the quantum world
is far more mysterious

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:90%
than they could have imagined.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:84%
When they observed,
the electron went back

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:84%
to behaving like
a little marble.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:84%
It produced a pattern of two
bands, not an interference

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:90%
pattern of many.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:84%
The very act of
measuring, or observing,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
which slit it went
through meant it only

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:90%
went through one, not both.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.850 align:middle line:84%
The electron decided
to act differently,

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
as though it was aware
it was being watched.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So the electron
is very peculiar.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Electron is very
peculiar in the sense

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:84%
that when you are not
looking, electron can be here,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.850 align:middle line:84%
can be there, or it
can be over there,

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:90%
in the corner of this room.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:84%
It can be all over this
storm, so to speak.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But whenever we look,
this is the strange thing

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:90%
about this electron.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we
look, we always find

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
them to be in one
particular Geiger counter.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Although we may have a room
full of Geiger counters,

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
we never hear the Geiger counter
sticking all over the room.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:84%
This is the fundamentally
important stuff

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:90%
about the electrons.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It was here that
physicists stepped forever

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
into the strange never
world of quantum events.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:90%
What is matter?

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Marbles or waves?

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:90%
And waves of what?

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And what does an observer
have to do with any of this?

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:33.370 align:middle line:84%
The observer collapsed the wave
function simply by observing.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>> We are always the observer.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.190 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we
identify with the event

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:84%
so much so that we even lose
the aspect of the observer.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.253 align:middle line:84%
That's why the materialist
gets totally lost

00:09:53.253 --> 00:09:55.295 align:middle line:84%
and thinks that we could
do without the observer.

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The physics data tells us
that an object itself is really

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.840 align:middle line:84%
a simplification for
what we call out there,

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.510 align:middle line:84%
what is particularly when we're
looking at atomic and subatomic

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.680 align:middle line:84%
particles, or atomic and
subatomic matter in any form.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.530 align:middle line:84%
What we find is how
we go to look at it,

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:84%
what we choose to
examine it with,

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:84%
actually changes the
properties of what

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:90%
we observe to be out there.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this the observer,
and which is so intricate

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.540 align:middle line:84%
to understanding the wacky,
weird world of quantum

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:90%
particles and how they react?

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Is this then the observer?

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And even though we cannot
have a quantum field without

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.300 align:middle line:84%
the observation of scientists
who have gone there,

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
who have uncovered it, layer
after layer after layer,

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:90%
they're all observers.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.640 align:middle line:84%
But not one of them
agree conclusively

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:84%
on all points in the
field, because they

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
are perceiving the
field mathematically

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:84%
from different
angles of perception.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Mathematics shows us clearly
that the movement of objects

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:10%
are describable only in
terms of possibilities,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.590 align:middle line:10%
not the actual events that
happens in our experience.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:10%
Quantum physics calculates
only possibilities,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:10%
that if we accept this, then
the question immediately comes,

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.210 align:middle line:10%
who, what chooses among
these possibilities

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:10%
to bring the actual
event of experience.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So we directly, immediately
see that consciousness must be

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:84%
involved. the observer
cannot be ignored.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Observer is part of the
description of the world.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.560 align:middle line:84%
But the observer is not
included in quantum physics.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:84%
We can only describe the
objects, not the subject.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:84%
So we get the idea that
the subject must be more

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:90%
fundamental than the objects.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
more fundamental.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't know, in
quantum mechanics,

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.590 align:middle line:84%
how to hook ourselves as
observers up with the world.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
to treat ourselves

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:84%
as observers, as just another
part of the physical system

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.997 align:middle line:90%
that we're describing.

00:12:32.997 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:84%
The only way we know how to
do quantum mechanics as it's

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.580 align:middle line:84%
traditionally
formulated is to keep

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:84%
the observer outside of the
system you're describing.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.325 align:middle line:84%
The minute you put him in,
you get all these paradoxes.

00:12:45.325 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're forced to say
things in quantum mechanics

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:84%
like, look, the book is
doing what it's doing

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:90%
because of quantum mechanics.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And I see that because
I'm there and I see it,

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and you'd better
not try to analyze

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that second part of
the sentence in terms

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:84%
of applying quantum
mechanics to it,

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
to break down.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why there are these two
separate laws of the evolutions

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.832 align:middle line:84%
of physical systems,
one that applies

00:13:05.832 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:84%
when you're not looking
at them, the other that

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.230 align:middle line:90%
applies when you are.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:90%
But that's crazy.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no way that we're
ever going to mathematize,

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.530 align:middle line:84%
or put into
mathematical formula,

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.890 align:middle line:84%
this very act in which a
conscious observer comes up

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:90%
with the answer.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh, the measuring
instruments, the recorder

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:90%
records it and there it is.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:24.680 align:middle line:90%
It's on the tape.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:90%
It's recorded.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.130 align:middle line:84%
You forgot one part
of the equation.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Somebody has to
look at the tape.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And till somebody looks at the
tape, it ain't recorded at all.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Until there's an ear, there
is no sound in the forest.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The extreme view
would be idealism.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Bishop Berkeley and
the Hindu approach,

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:84%
which says that consciousness
is all there is,

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and that all there
is my consciousness,

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm creating you, and the
camera and the world around me,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.470 align:middle line:90%
and all there is is me.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But that is a view that's
impossible to refute,

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.990 align:middle line:84%
because I can't
really prove that you

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:84%
are out there in reality and
have your own consciousness.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can't prove
that I'm conscious.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So idealism, both from the
Western standpoint, from what

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Bishop Berkeley said,
and the Hindu tradition,

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:90%
is one possibility.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Another possibility, the
Copenhagen interpretation

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.250 align:middle line:84%
says we create reality
by, an observation

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:90%
collapses the wave function.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
that is it doesn't

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:90%
say what observation is.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say what
consciousness is.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Why is our brain different from
a measuring device or anything

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:90%
else?

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And what is-- and
it kind of puts

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.600 align:middle line:90%
consciousness outside science.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So my view is somewhere
in the middle,

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.966 align:middle line:84%
with the Penrose
objective reduction, where

00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:44.870 align:middle line:84%
you have a superposition which
reaches threshold and self

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:84%
collapses and chooses a
reality at that point,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:84%
of a number of-- it's
kind of a multiple choice.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not like starting from
scratch, anything you want.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a multiple choice,
multiple possibilities

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:90%
for each specific collapse.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty is,
according to-- this

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:84%
is one of Roger's
great contributions,

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I think-- is that he said the
platonic information embedded

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.040 align:middle line:84%
in the fundamental level of
the universe helps to choose

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:84%
or influences, influences
which choice is made.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:84%
This only occurs in the
objective reduction.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you make a
conscious choice,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
if you're mindful
about it and don't

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:84%
act rashly or reflexively,
maybe think about it

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself
to be influenced

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:84%
by what you want
to call instinct

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:31.190 align:middle line:84%
or intuition or your higher
power or the way of the Dao

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:84%
or may the force be with you,
however you want to put in,

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
the quantum information
embedded at the Planck scale

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:84%
will influence your decision one
way or the other for the good,

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:90%
generally.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
a way of bringing

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of spiritual
divine guidance, if you will.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the important
innovations of quantum

00:15:53.540 --> 00:16:00.410 align:middle line:84%
mechanics is that a certain
fantasy that held in physics up

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:05.180 align:middle line:84%
until then about the possibility
of observing something entirely

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:84%
passively, observing it without
affecting it in the process

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:84%
of observing it,
however things turn out,

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
it's fairly clear now that
quantum mechanics will have

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:90%
ended that permanently.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Looking at things involves
interacting with them,

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and it involves
interacting with them

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
in a way whose effect
can't be minimized,

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.830 align:middle line:84%
no matter how delicate
your technology is.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Ultimately, science
says we have an influence

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.390 align:middle line:90%
on the observed.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Strict separability,
strict objectivity,

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.730 align:middle line:84%
where we can stand
back and observe nature

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
without really
entering into nature

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and even modifying nature.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:84%
That strict separability
is no longer possible.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
We understand that now
from quantum mechanics.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:84%
At the very core of life, the
very foundation of experience,

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
it's all created
by consciousness.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:84%
The very earliest experience,
the beginning of the universe,

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:84%
you could say is when
pure consciousness,

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:12.030 align:middle line:84%
the unified field, seeing itself
creates within its essentially

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%

From that, at that
deepest level of reality,

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:90%
consciousness creates creation.

a tremendous impact on what

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.700 align:middle line:90%
reality is all about.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And because of how consciousness
works for us as human beings,

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
because of the possible effects
the consciousness may have

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:84%
on things that are out
there in the world,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.210 align:middle line:84%
we can see that there
is some relationship

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:84%
between what is observed and
what the observer is doing.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
So if, in that
regard, the observer

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.120 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to effect
what is being observed,

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:84%
then yes, there is some way
in which the observer can

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:84%
ultimately impact or affect
the thing that you are,

in fact, trying to look at.

is that the man who makes

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:84%
the breakthrough in quantum
uncertainty, for example,

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Heisenberg's principle did a
great thing when he did that,

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
because he realized that there
was uncertainty that even he

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
couldn't observe but
only as uncertainty.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And that only meant that
someone else was guiding them

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.830 align:middle line:90%

And yet, they are completely
beyond understanding.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:84%
For instance, what we
were just talking about,

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:84%
superposition and the
notion that something

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:32.810 align:middle line:84%
can exist in two
places at once and yet

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.910 align:middle line:84%
be in neither of
those two places.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, that's a perfectly
good English sentence, I think.

But you can't actually
make sense out of it.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And I can write an
equation that basically

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
says in mathematical
terms what I just

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:84%
said in English that gives the
probability that if you look,

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.310 align:middle line:84%
you'll find the
object to the left

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and a certain other
probability that when you look,

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:90%
you'll find it to the right.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
That's all neat and clean
and the mathematics of it,

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:90%
brooks no contradiction.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:84%
But to say that before
you look, the object

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:84%
is in both places
and yet neither

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and it isn't that when you
look, like lifting a shell up

either the bead is there

or it isn't there,
it isn't that way.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Before you take the
shell off, the bead

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:33.530 align:middle line:84%

whether the bead is there

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.240 align:middle line:84%

determined by anything

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>> To go down the rabbit
hole and to get away from

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:90%
the mundane is thrilling.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Everybody secretly
is an adventurer.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:84%
When we head down
a rabbit hole, we

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:84%
have to reformat
all of our knowledge

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and our present
understanding and we

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:58.790 align:middle line:84%
have to be able to combine
knowledge in a different way

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:84%
than we've processed
it up to this point.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84%
It means that we have
to step outside the box

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:84%
of our most familiar, most
common way of thinking.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.998 align:middle line:84%
We have to begin to perceive the
question or the understanding

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:14.290 align:middle line:90%
from a different point of view.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
do that, you have

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.970 align:middle line:90%
to mix circuits in the brain.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It's tricky.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
want to go there.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.450 align:middle line:90%
You do want to go there?

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So entanglement is space
separated and time separated.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.700 align:middle line:84%
One way of looking
very specifically

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:84%
at the time separation
aspect, it's

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.630 align:middle line:84%
much easier to do this with
one individual rather than two.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Because who are you better
entangled with than anyone?

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:90%
It's yourself.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It's your future self
that you're entangled with

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:90%
and your past self.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So the experiment that I
developed to look at this

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.700 align:middle line:84%
is we wire you up,
typically to look

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.260 align:middle line:84%
at skin conductance
but also heart

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:90%
rate and other parameters.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.730 align:middle line:84%
You will sit in front
of a computer screen

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:00.987 align:middle line:90%
and you press a button.

00:28:00.987 --> 00:28:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know that five
seconds later, you're

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.183 align:middle line:90%
going to see a picture.

00:28:04.183 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:84%
It could a very calm
picture or it might

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.620 align:middle line:90%
be a very emotional picture.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's randomly
selected by the computer

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:12.283 align:middle line:90%
immediately before it's shown.

00:28:12.283 --> 00:28:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you press the
button, the future

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.050 align:middle line:90%
is not yet determined.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So you would need
real precognition

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to jump into
the future and get it somehow.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So since we're looking
at your physiology,

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.110 align:middle line:84%
we know what happens
to physiology after you

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:90%
see an emotional image.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And we know what happens
after you see a calm image.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:84%
The question is, does
that future experience

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.720 align:middle line:90%
leak into your present?

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Does it happen before
you see the picture?

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And through this experiment,
you can see what happens.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Electrical activity
of the heart, EKG.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.830 align:middle line:84%
This is
photoplethysmograph, which

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:47.940 align:middle line:84%
is the amount of blood in the
fingertip, and respiration,

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.630 align:middle line:90%
breathing in, breathing out.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Press the button.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.805 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens
to physiology?

00:28:51.805 --> 00:28:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it starts rising
before the image appears,

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.583 align:middle line:84%
it may suggest that you're about
to get an emotional picture.

00:28:59.583 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And if it stays calm,
it suggests maybe you're

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.890 align:middle line:90%
going to get a calm picture.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So we've done this
kind of experiment

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.650 align:middle line:84%
for several hundred
people, and colleagues have

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:90%
run this experiment as well.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out, that
is exactly what you see.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.260 align:middle line:84%
People become aroused before
randomly selected pictures

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
in the future that
happen to be emotional

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and they remain calm before
randomly selected pictures that

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:90%
are calm.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.500 align:middle line:84%
This has been seen in heart rate
changes, in skin conductance,

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.290 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, and
basically systemically

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:31.370 align:middle line:90%
throughout the body.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.740 align:middle line:84%
We are entangled with
our future selves.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.500 align:middle line:90%


00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Wormholes, or
topological fluctuations,

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.710 align:middle line:84%
really channels of communication
that connect distant parts

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:90%
of the universe instantaneously.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Even time travel is possible.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The way I understand the
rabbit hole is that it is

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:90%
a portal to another reality.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Now that could be the most
banal thing in the world,

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:84%
if I just open a door
and go through it,

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.090 align:middle line:84%
portal means very
little in that sense.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But in the sense we're
talking about it here,

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.240 align:middle line:84%
we're talking
about how we access

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.730 align:middle line:90%
another dimension of reality.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You now can see in numerous
labs around United States

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
objects that are large enough
to be seen by the naked eye

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and they are in two
places simultaneously.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.790 align:middle line:84%
You can actually take
a photograph of that.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Now I suppose if you showed
a photograph, they'd say, oh,

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.050 align:middle line:84%
great, here's this nice
blob of colored light

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.493 align:middle line:84%
and I see there's a
bit of it over here

00:30:38.493 --> 00:30:39.410 align:middle line:90%
and another bit of it.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a
picture of two dots.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.140 align:middle line:90%
What's the big deal?

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Superposition
is pre-detection.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:49.394 align:middle line:84%
What I was speaking about in
the film is post detection.

00:30:49.394 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Now under normal
circumstances, a single object,

00:30:54.910 --> 00:31:00.130 align:middle line:84%
once it has been detected,
is in just one position.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.890 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
states of matter

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:84%
that have been created
now in which objects

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.210 align:middle line:84%
can be in multiple
positions simultaneously,

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:16.850 align:middle line:84%
not just two, but actually
as many as 3,000 positions.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:84%
The first of these objects
were called Bose Einstein

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.480 align:middle line:90%
condensates.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And they are single
wave functions,

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.900 align:middle line:84%
meaning they are
single particles.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.510 align:middle line:84%
But even though they're
a single wave function,

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:35.900 align:middle line:84%
the wave function has
multiple positions.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And, if so, well,
look, but look.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Look right in the chamber.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:90%
You can see it right there.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see two things there.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.212 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, no, no,
that's not two things.

00:31:42.212 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
in two places.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Tricky point here is that
it's still a single wave

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.490 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:55.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not 3,000 separate
wave functions.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.770 align:middle line:90%
It's one wave function.

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.095 align:middle line:90%
So it's one particle.

00:32:00.095 --> 00:32:03.840 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that people's
jaw would drop about it.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think
people really believe it.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean that people
say, oh, you're lying,

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:16.490 align:middle line:84%
or, oh, the scientists
are confused.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it is so mysterious
that you can't even

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:21.740 align:middle line:90%
understand how amazing it is.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:27.173 align:middle line:84%
One particle in 3,000
different locations.

00:32:27.173 --> 00:32:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Now if you were
to weigh one of them,

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.850 align:middle line:84%
would it weight one
three thousandth?

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well you can't
weigh one of them.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it's one particle.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it's one
indivisible particle.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.300 align:middle line:90%


00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>> But if it's in
different locations,

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.890 align:middle line:90%
can't you put a scale under one?

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's inseparable.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not a-- this is the tricky
conceptual part, that it's not

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.360 align:middle line:90%
3,000 separate parts.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though it
looks that way.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:01.440 align:middle line:90%
You can look at it and--

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't actually
see the one with 3,000,

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.675 align:middle line:84%
but you can look at the
simpler ones, the ones that

00:33:05.675 --> 00:33:07.990 align:middle line:84%
are two or three or four,
and you can see the--

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:12.130 align:middle line:84%
you can see-- as to say, if you
go on, if you go onto the web,

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.840 align:middle line:84%
you'll see photographs
of these, you'll

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.365 align:middle line:84%
see these little dots
floating in space.

00:33:17.365 --> 00:33:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And these are the different
parts of one object.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:25.565 align:middle line:90%
It's not, they're not separable.

00:33:25.565 --> 00:33:27.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not four different objects
or six different objects,

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.480 align:middle line:84%
it's one wave function,
it's one object.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.398 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a real
brain fart, isn't it?

00:33:33.398 --> 00:33:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Because when you think
about it, you just--

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.570 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, no, no, no,
they're like here, here, here.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's obviously
one, two, three.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>> No, and you can't pull
one away from the others.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:84%
If you try to pull one
away from the others,

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.618 align:middle line:84%
the entire thing
will just disappear.

00:33:46.618 --> 00:33:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And then furthermore, you
know, you've seen "Star Trek"

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.933 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot, beam me up, Scotty.

00:33:50.933 --> 00:33:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Beam me up, Scotty.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.290 align:middle line:84%
