00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We took two simple
black boxes like this.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Inside is a very
simple electric circuit

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.460 align:middle line:84%
with a few diodes,
oscillator, EEPROM,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.620 align:middle line:90%
some resistors and capacitors.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Basically, that's it.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:90%
We wrapped one in aluminum foil.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:84%
We put it in an
electrically-grounded Faraday

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.810 align:middle line:90%
cage.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And the other-- we sat on a
tabletop around which four very

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:84%
well-qualified
meditators, highly

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.450 align:middle line:84%
inner self-managed
individuals sit.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And they go into a
deep meditative state.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:90%
They cleanse the environment.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.080 align:middle line:84%
They make it essentially
a sacred space,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:84%
using their
mind-cleansing procedures

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and their intentions.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the four
speaks the specific intention

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:90%
for this device.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:84%
The intention is to influence a
particular target experiment--

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:84%
might be to increase
the pH of purified water

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:84%
by one full pH unit or to
decrease the pH by one full pH

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.510 align:middle line:90%
unit.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
We had used these devices
on all those experiments

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and have been
robustly successful.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:90%
In the meditative process--

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:84%
then after one speaks
the particular intention,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:84%
it's held various ways by
the four for maybe 15 minutes

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:90%
and then so be it.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:90%
It's let go.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And then a subsidiary
intention is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
stated to seal that
imprint into the device.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
We take one of these devices
with this aluminum foil.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:90%
We put it in a soft package.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:90%
We put in a FedEx packet.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:84%
We ship it 2,000 miles
away to the laboratory we

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:90%
we're using up in Minnesota.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as it
arrives there, it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:84%
goes into its own electrically
routed Faraday cage.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:84%
The next day, we do the
same with the control.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:90%
The experiment is running.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And basically, then one
just takes the device out,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
sets it beside the experiment
within 6 inches to a foot,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and turns it on for
a period of time.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, we learned over
some period of time

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:90%
that there was another factor.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:90%
We found that the use of these--

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:84%
we call them intention
imprinted electrical devices.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:84%
The continued use of
this somehow conditions

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:84%
the space to some higher
level of symmetry.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And we start getting
new phenomena.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:90%
That is, the devices work.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
That is, the pH,
which is normal,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
starts rising one full pH
unit if that was the imprint

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:90%
or starts dropping.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Living system-- you go
plus or minus 1/2 a pH unit

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.350 align:middle line:84%
in either direction,
you're dead on both ends.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:90%
So these are very big effects.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, in
terms of healing,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that we
ultimately expect to do

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to broadcast
this so that we create

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.626 align:middle line:84%
an environment
where people are 500

00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:84%
or 1,000 miles away
or 10,000 miles away,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
wherein they can
use their intention

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:90%
to enhance their health.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The question is when you're
studying the mind/matter

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
interface, how do you
go about studying it?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
From a naive point of view,
you would think that maybe we

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
should just get
a feather and see

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
if we can make it float or
get an object and push it.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, though,
that happens so rarely.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Even spontaneously, it
happens extremely rarely.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
It basically never
happens in the laboratory.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think the reason that the
mind/matter interface does not

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:84%
work very well on a
large physical object

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:84%
is because that object has
an enormous amount of inertia

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:90%
to stay where it is.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.783 align:middle line:84%
You might be thinking thoughts
at it, saying, push, move.

00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's thinking thoughts
back at you saying,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.997 align:middle line:90%
no, I don't want to.

00:03:59.997 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, it would take an enormous
amount of physical force

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:90%
in order to make it move.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So back in the 1600s,
when Francis Bacon

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
was developing
empiricism in science,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:84%
he actually wrote
in one of his books

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
about ways of studying the
mind/matter interaction

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and mentioned dice
as a possibility.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Because every time
a die bounces,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
it can trace all the way
down to quantum events, which

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.050 align:middle line:84%
cause it to turn this
way versus that way.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So if it bounces
a bunch of times,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.900 align:middle line:84%
it basically becomes a quantum
mechanical uncertainty, even

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
in something as
large as the die.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
So back in the
1930s, researchers

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:84%
started using dice as a form
to see if mind can somehow

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:84%
get into the quantum uncertainty
and bias what is happening

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.420 align:middle line:90%
in the die as it was rolling.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Around the 1960s, when
electronics came around,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:84%
someone had the
idea of simulating

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:90%
a die in electronic circuits.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
that became useful

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
was because it became very easy
to measure precisely what was

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
happening in every single bounce
or equivalent of a bounce.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And you could record
it automatically.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.987 align:middle line:84%
You can create new
kinds of experiments

00:05:14.987 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:84%
where you didn't
have to worry anymore

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.790 align:middle line:84%
about whether the
recording was correct

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.250 align:middle line:84%
or whether the die
became unbalanced.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:84%
So random number generators,
modern versions of it

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
were created as a
refinement of techniques

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that had been used
in the laboratory

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And could you go over some
of your findings on that?

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>> One type of random
number generator experiment

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that's been conducted
many, many times,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of times over the
past four decades or so, since

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
around the 1960s, has been
a random generator that only

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
produces sequences
of random bits--

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:90%
0s and 1s, like flipping coins.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And you would simply ask
somebody to press a button.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:90%
It would produce 200 bits.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And you would ask
them to say, well,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:84%
try to make it produce
more 1 bits than 0 bits.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.963 align:middle line:84%
And when you take the
entire body of literature,

00:06:07.963 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:84%
all of the hundreds
of experiments

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:84%
that have been done, you
can ask a single question--

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle line:84%
did it matter that people were
trying to push it towards 1s

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:90%
or push it towards 0s?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And the overall answer
is, yes, it does matter,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:84%
that somehow intention is
correlated with the operation,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.670 align:middle line:84%
with the output of these
random number generators,

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:84%
such that if you
wish for more 1s,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:84%
somehow the generators
produce more 1s.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:10%
The last analysis
that I did, which

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:10%
looked at all of
these experiments

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:10%
that the final analysis
is, 50,000 to 1,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:10%
the odds against
chance are 50,000 to 1

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.112 align:middle line:10%
that the behavior of the
random number generators

00:06:47.112 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:10%
would go in the
direction that they

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.350 align:middle line:10%
did that were consistent
with what intention

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:10%
was wishing them to do.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So when they talk about
in quantum physics being

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle line:84%
a completely arbitrary
and random process,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.740 align:middle line:84%
what they're not accounting
for is the extraordinary effect

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:84%
of human thought,
of human intention.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>> When the OJ Simpson trial
was going on, lots of people are

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
watching television, because
of the courtroom drama that was

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.650 align:middle line:90%
unfolding.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And [INAUDIBLE]
intuited that there must

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.110 align:middle line:90%
be a lot of intention going on.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll preface it with why
we thought of doing that

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So for 30 years, people
in the laboratory

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
have been taking the random
number generator and the human

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and asking the human to try to
interact with the generator.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:90%
And we see small effects.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while, after
repeating it over and over

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.560 align:middle line:90%
again, basically it gets boring.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:90%
What else does it mean?

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the implications
of what it means

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:84%
is that we're not
dealing-- when we

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.980 align:middle line:84%
deal with stuff
in the laboratory,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.060 align:middle line:84%
it's an artificial and
constrained environment.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely difficult
to produce real intention

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and real motivation
in a laboratory,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
but that's where these
big things happen.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking for ways of
getting out of the laboratory,

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.260 align:middle line:84%
but still maintaining control
over what we're measuring.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So you take a random
number generator

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
into an environment like
a group that's meditating,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.822 align:middle line:90%
long-term meditators.

00:08:11.822 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:90%
They know what they're doing.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.287 align:middle line:84%
They become extremely
coherent as a group.

00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, well,
that would be a good place

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
to take a random
number generator.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe their
intention is infiltrating out

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:84%
into the environment and
creating a form of order,

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
mind order that would
be reflected in matter.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll take our
form of matter, which

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:90%
is a random number generator.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.340 align:middle line:84%
We know how to look for
order in these things,

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:84%
because the only thing that
can happen in a random number

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%
generator that's unusual
is to become less random.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So we use statistical
ways of detecting that.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, my colleagues,
Roger Nelson, Dick Bierman,

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:84%
many others around the world
have taken the random number

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:84%
generators within groups that
are doing coherent things.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, the
random number generators

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.680 align:middle line:90%
become coherent.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.803 align:middle line:90%
So the matter becomes ordered.

00:09:00.803 --> 00:09:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
thinking, well,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.660 align:middle line:84%
what would happen if we're not
dealing with groups of a couple

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.830 align:middle line:84%
dozen, but with hundreds of
millions of people, all of whom

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:84%
had their attention focused
suddenly on something?

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And as it turned out, that
about a month from the time

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.130 align:middle line:84%
I had that thought was going
to be the reading of the OJ

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Simpson verdict.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So this was an unusual
point in human history,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
I think, in that people
knew far in advance

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:84%
that within a
fraction of a second,

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
either saying the words
guilty or not guilty,

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.140 align:middle line:84%
something of very high
interest would occur,

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
which would attract hundreds
of millions of people live.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I figured, OK, we have to do
this as an experiment then.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I had three random number
generators running in my lab.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And I asked a colleague to
run a generator in Amsterdam

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.710 align:middle line:90%
and another in Princeton.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:84%
We had five random
number generators going.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I figured it's a
worldwide effect.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we would see a
change in the generators

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
as we approach that moment in
time when the verdict was read.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So we ran the
generators afterwards

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.010 align:middle line:90%
and evaluated the results.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, we saw a
spike with odds of 1,000 to 1

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:90%
at actually two places.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.000 align:middle line:84%
One was when the camera switched
from outside the courthouse

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:84%
to inside the chambers,
it was a huge rise

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
of attention,
which was reflected

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:90%
in the random generators.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And then at the moment
that the verdict was read,

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
it was this large
spike of coherence

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:90%
and all five generators at once.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So this was taking an idea that
we had seen in the laboratory

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and scaling it up to
the world at large.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:84%
no great outbreaks of
infectious disease as a result

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:90%
of the tsunami disaster.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.060 align:middle line:84%
With a repetition
of similar actions,

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.365 align:middle line:84%
people may start regaining
faith in prayers.

00:16:56.365 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, in other words, there
may be more disasters, be it

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.359 align:middle line:84%
natural or man made,
that would create

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:90%
more casualties along the way.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Through these
experiences, more people

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.920 align:middle line:84%
may be able to perceive
these problems as their own,

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.930 align:middle line:84%
that they are all
responsible as well.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>> If we really learn to love,
these particular problems

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:36.290 align:middle line:84%
of separateness will just
disappear like a flimsy mist

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
when the morning
sun comes about.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So we do the
OJ Simpson thing.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And we have an amazing result.
A number of years go by.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And a number of us-- more
of us are getting interested

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
in this thing, this kind of
idea of taking random number

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.330 align:middle line:84%
generators and seeing whether
we can detect the world reacting

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So an unhappy event
occurred where Princess Di

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:90%
died in an accident.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And somewhat similar
to the OJ thing,

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
everyone knew a week
in advance that there

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.308 align:middle line:84%
was going to be a live
broadcast of the funeral.

00:18:09.308 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And this was such a
shock around the world,

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.308 align:middle line:84%
that we knew that it would
probably attract something

00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:90%
like a billion viewers live.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So this case, we had 12
colleagues, each of whom

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.430 align:middle line:84%
had a similar kind of
random number generator

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.690 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And we all got together
and recorded data before,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:84%
during, and after the funeral
and came up with a formal test

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
to see whether or not there was
a deviation in the generators.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And as it turned out, there
was, a significant deviation

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:84%
among all of these
generators around the world.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Another year or so goes by.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And we start thinking,
these one-shot experiments

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:90%
are interesting.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.097 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to miss things
that happened spontaneously.

00:18:46.097 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
interesting to know

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:84%
what would have happened when
the first news broadcast went

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:90%
out that Princess Di had died.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So this generated the notion
of the Global Consciousness

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Project, which is headed by
Roger Nelson at Princeton.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is to take
random number generators,

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:10%
locate them around the world,
run them 24 hours a day.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And every five minutes,
send all the data

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.110 align:middle line:84%
up to a single web
server at Princeton.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:90%
So we have a continuous record.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And we've had it
now for eight years,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:84%
a continuous record
of randomness

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.590 align:middle line:90%
from around the world.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
We have data now for two
basic types of events.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:90%
We have planned events like Y2K.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It was, again, a moment
of a stroke of midnight

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:84%
where everyone was going to be
paying attention in each time

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:90%
zone.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
spontaneous events like 9/11

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.378 align:middle line:90%
that weren't planned.

00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:10%
But we're able to
look at all of them

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.070 align:middle line:10%
now in terms of what
happened to this randomness,

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:10%
this physical measure of
randomness around the world

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:50.060 align:middle line:10%
when a lot of minds suddenly
became focused on something.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And the short story
of this is that we

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
have hundreds of events now,
both planned and unplanned.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And it is very clear that,
overall, the randomness is not

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
as random as it ought
to be, by theory, when

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.220 align:middle line:90%
these events are occurring.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Large-scale events that
attract a lot of attention

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:84%
create a certain
mental coherence,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:84%
which seems to be
reflected in what's

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.150 align:middle line:84%
going on in random
generators around the world.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.280 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing of interest.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
of interest is--

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and we noticed this
first when 9/11 occurred.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
We analyzed it very closely
to see what was happening.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
There were 37 random
generators running that day.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:90%
We go into the data.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And you look at it over
the course of the day--

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:90%
9/11.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:84%
You find a very unusual
statistical structure

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:90%
in the data.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.680 align:middle line:84%
You find a six-standard
deviation change.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It's as though if you
think about the results

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:84%
of this experiment
like a bell shape,

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:84%
we're constantly recreating
a bell-shaped curve.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
statistics look like.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're interested in,
how does the bell ring?

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:90%
How does it swing?

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:90%
How does it vibrate over time?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the way of thinking
about the statistic.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
On 9/11, the bell
rang extremely loud.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:90%
It swung hard in one direction.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And it swung hard in the
other direction, basically.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we thought,
well, that's unusual.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:90%
So we compared it to other days.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
We started comparing it to
more or more days around 9/11.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that 9/11,
within the year 2001,

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.300 align:middle line:84%
was the loudest
ringing of the bell,

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:84%
while it was probably also the
most focused day of attention

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.525 align:middle line:90%
for 2001 and maybe since then.

00:21:35.525 --> 00:21:36.900 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that was interest

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
is that the bell started
to swing before 8:30

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.000 align:middle line:90%
in the morning Eastern Time.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:84%
It began to swing noticeably
before the events unfolded,

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:84%
which suggested something
like a premonition.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
There was something beginning
to build statistically

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:84%
that then basically
exploded at them

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.570 align:middle line:90%
and when the events unraveled.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.132 align:middle line:90%
But something was a premonition.

00:22:01.132 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most interesting
experiments with random event

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:84%
generators occurred when
it was really out of time.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Some of the Princeton
investigators

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
other ones decided

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
that they would try
to see whether or not

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.840 align:middle line:84%
you could affect a random
machine after it had run.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.160 align:middle line:90%
So they converted it.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Instead of having a computer
with a visual screen,

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:84%
they had a computerized
situation that was audiotapes.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And they had it with
clicks in the left ear

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:90%
and clicks in the right ear.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And they already played
this with nobody listening

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:84%
to it so that it
had already ran.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:90%
They put that in a vault.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And they then gave the already
run tape to a participant

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:90%
and said, take it home.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.980 align:middle line:90%
I want you to listen to it.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to make more
left ear clicks than right ear

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:90%
clicks with it.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Send your intention to it.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:90%
So the person did.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.220 align:middle line:90%
They handed back the tape.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:90%
And they played it.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:90%
And lo and behold--

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.128 align:middle line:84%
and they played the
one in the vault, too.

00:23:03.128 --> 00:23:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered that
they were both the same.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And they both had more left
clicks than right clicks.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:90%
So what was going on here?

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, it wasn't as though the
person who was the participant

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
had actually affected it at the
moment he was listening to it.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.230 align:middle line:84%
His thoughts and
his attention had

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:84%
moved back down the
timeline and affected it

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:90%
at the moment it was generated.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people don't affect
reality in a consistent,

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:84%
substantial way, because
they don't believe they can.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Cannot believe people who
say that none of this is so.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:84%
"None of this is so" is relative
to them and their following.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.550 align:middle line:90%
What would you rather choose?

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:47.430 align:middle line:90%
That it isn't so or it is so?

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:51.630 align:middle line:90%
And who bags the truth?

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Who holds the bag of truth--

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
someone out there
that's saying this

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.610 align:middle line:84%
is impossible or somebody out
there that said, absolutely is?

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:90%
Who holds the bag of truth?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I like the placebo effect,
because it has to do with

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.300 align:middle line:90%
a person's acceptance.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.743 align:middle line:90%
It's really what it's about.

00:24:09.743 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, they
took these group

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:84%
of people that had
Parkinson's disease.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And in Parkinson's
disease, there's

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
a problem in the brain
with making dopamine.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a little nuclei
called a substantia nigra

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:90%
that stops making dopamine.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when
there's no dopamine,

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.190 align:middle line:84%
the body starts to
respond differently.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.730 align:middle line:84%
We have musculoskeletal
problems.

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:84%
We have tremors and what's
called intention tremors.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So we have foot shuffling,
or we have pill rolling.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And these are muscular
actions that supersede

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:90%
our voluntary control.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:90%
We can't control those.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So I took a group of people
that had Parkinson's disease.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.838 align:middle line:84%
And they said to
them, now, listen,

00:24:47.838 --> 00:24:51.180 align:middle line:84%
we have this injection that's
going to make you better.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, 50% of the people that got
the injection, all of a sudden,

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.230 align:middle line:84%
lost all their
motor dysfunction.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
weren't pill rolling.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.730 align:middle line:84%
They weren't shuffling
their feet anymore.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
intention tremors

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.190 align:middle line:84%
when they were
grabbing for objects.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So the doctor said, well, that's
a great example of a placebo.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:90%
It's all in your mind.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:84%
But when they checked
the dopamine levels that

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.930 align:middle line:84%
were produced in the brain, the
interesting thing that happened

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.530 align:middle line:84%
was that the brain
started making dopamine,

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.110 align:middle line:84%
because they accepted
that they were well.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:84%
In other words, their thought
that they were well allowed

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:90%
them to begin to be well.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you're being well
in the quantum field,

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:84%
the observer has to
supply the chemistry

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.070 align:middle line:90%
to match who you're being.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The issue of whether we do a
detailed statement of intention

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
or if we do it in such a
way that we leave it open

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:84%
for the universe to
find a way to do it,

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:90%
generally it's the latter.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Certainly for the
water, it's the latter.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
For example, one of the
four sitters, meditators,

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.790 align:middle line:84%
thinks of it when
the intention is red,

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:90%
and it's to increase the pH.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Person visualizes a
thermometer and it's going up.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.770 align:middle line:90%
That's it, OK?

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So each uses its
own visualization.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But in this particular
case, then, it's

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:90%
just a pure intention.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And the intention seems to
act like a true thermodynamic

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.690 align:middle line:84%
potential, every bit as much
as pressure and temperature

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:90%
and the universe.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.000 align:middle line:84%
That thermodynamic
driving force,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:84%
if you'll call it
that for intention,

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:84%
then acts on the
available processes.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And those processes
do their thing.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:41.830 align:middle line:90%
And the effect happens.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we do create our
own reality all the time,

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.630 align:middle line:90%
have always done so.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:84%
But the type of reality that we
create with all its limitations

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and its suffering, disease,
lack, accidents, vicissitudes

00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:90%
of various kinds--

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:04.590 align:middle line:84%
that mirrors the consciousness
that we express through.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:84%
So we are creating our
own reality every day,

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:84%
though we find that very
hard to accept with--

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing more
exquisitely pleasant

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.420 align:middle line:84%
than to blame somebody
else for the way we are.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.600 align:middle line:84%
It's her fault or his
fault. It's the system.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.050 align:middle line:90%
It's God.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:90%
It's my parents.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the stage.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But in quantum physics, we're
brought back to reality.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Whatever way we observe
the world around

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:90%
us is what comes back to us.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why my
life, for instance,

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:38.300 align:middle line:84%
is so lacking in joy and
happiness and fulfillment

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:43.340 align:middle line:84%
is because my focus is lacking
in those same things exactly.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we're
talking about here

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.880 align:middle line:90%
in creating our own reality--

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:84%
it's not something
[SNAPS FINGERS] like that.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about what is
deeply and fully accepted

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:90%
in my being about life.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.930 align:middle line:84%
That slowly manifests
itself every day.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So if I go into a
grocery store and I

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:06.350 align:middle line:84%
want to manifest $100 bill
to pay for my groceries,

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:07.573 align:middle line:90%
I'm not talking about that.

00:28:07.573 --> 00:28:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
something that's

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.050 align:middle line:84%
much more slow to come
into manifestation.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, the life that we
experience-- if we're victims,

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:19.040 align:middle line:84%
we should ask ourselves,
have I a victim mentality?

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.670 align:middle line:84%
If I'm continually meeting
misfortunes and accidents

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and tragedies, maybe
it's because my mentality

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.620 align:middle line:84%
is basically attuned to
accepting that this is the way

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:90%
life is, and so it happens.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, why can I not
achieve those things?

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Fundamentally,
through lack of focus.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The average person loses
their attention span every 6

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.080 align:middle line:90%
to 10 seconds per minute.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> When one wants
to focus intent,

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.160 align:middle line:84%
you want to be a
singleness of mind.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why some of the
old occult teachings

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.835 align:middle line:84%
teach people to
focus on a flame--

00:28:55.835 --> 00:28:58.940 align:middle line:84%
a match flame, in
fact, so that you

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:05.360 align:middle line:84%
learn to bring your attention
into a very sharp channel

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.690 align:middle line:84%
so that the energy
density becomes greater.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>> To create something like $100
bill or a gold coin in my hand

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:16.760 align:middle line:84%
demands that I have to have
absolute control of my thoughts

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and absolute acceptance
that it will happen.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we do combine
those two things--

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
difficult to achieve,

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.810 align:middle line:90%
but not at all impossible--

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:28.430 align:middle line:90%
then they will happen.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics will laugh
and scoff at that.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.430 align:middle line:90%
But again, time is on our side.

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And science, I think,
is also on our side.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Because it's showing
us more and more

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.590 align:middle line:84%
that this is, in fact,
how reality behaves.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It is absolutely attendant
upon a thought that is fully

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.230 align:middle line:90%
and deeply felt and accepted.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The mind is
structured in layers,

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:84%
just like the universe is
structured in layers from

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.920 align:middle line:90%
superficial to profound.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And if we use the mind in
a very superficial level

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:84%
of ordinary thought, we
have very limited power.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:07.370 align:middle line:84%
We can barely move a speck
of dust across a tabletop

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.720 align:middle line:90%
without using our hands.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.270 align:middle line:90%
So weak can consciousness be.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But at the deepest
level of consciousness,

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.830 align:middle line:90%
consciousness creates universe.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:20.020 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Unified field theories endow
this universal unified field

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.680 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
with such creativity,

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.710 align:middle line:84%
that it's constantly
effervescing universes,

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.530 align:middle line:84%
like bubbles from
effervescent ginger ale,

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:36.760 align:middle line:84%
an uncountable infinity
of simultaneously emerging

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.290 align:middle line:90%
universes.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:39.850 align:middle line:90%
Many of these are duds.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.400 align:middle line:90%
They don't last very long.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.410 align:middle line:84%
But many of them undergo
cosmological inflation,

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:90%
exponential expansion.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.070 align:middle line:84%
They spawn galaxies
by the trillions.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:51.535 align:middle line:84%
>> But we always
wonder, then, don't we,

00:30:51.535 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
when we wish for all of us to
be able to heal with a touch,

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and to raise the dead, and
to manifest a loaf of bread

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.730 align:middle line:90%
in our hand?

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And we always wonder
why we can't do that.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.950 align:middle line:84%
But we can never ask a
question that we don't already

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.320 align:middle line:90%
know the answer to.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is because we
don't believe we could do it.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And it interferes
with our agenda

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:26.040 align:middle line:84%
of our own personal
addictions that define us.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:30.440 align:middle line:10%
We have never had enough
time to care for anyone

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:10%
else other than our own
emotional, addictive needs.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.000 align:middle line:90%
