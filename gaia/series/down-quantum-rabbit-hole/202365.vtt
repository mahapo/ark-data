one of the implications,
which was not

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:84%
appreciated at the time,
which was, that if a particle,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.610 align:middle line:84%
you can arrange
for two particles

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:90%

its anti-particle.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And you shoot them off
in opposite directions.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:84%
But they're in superposition,
it's two particles,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:90%
but they're in superposition.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're in a superposition
such that one state is

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:90%
this one up and the other down.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And the other state
is the reverse.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:90%
This one up and this one down.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Those are its two states.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's in both of those
states simultaneously.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's a so-called
two particle state.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It isn't that It has four
states, it only has two states.

This and this.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Now something comes along
and bumps the left-hand one

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and causes it to go into one
of its two possibilities.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:84%
It has two possibilities,
either up or down.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's say it goes up.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, then it means that
the other one must be down.

feedback between quantum events

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and matter itself,
the uncertainty,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
is that it's tighter
than a feedback loop.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:84%
It's that fact is simply
woven into the fabric

material bit of the universe.

Anytime there's a superposition,
and superpositions

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.240 align:middle line:84%
are happening all the
time, those superpositions

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:84%
are correlated with untold
other superpositions.

And what he meant
is, that when we

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
have our ordinary sense of the
way that the fabric of reality

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:84%
is, it seems like these two
places are absolutely in space,

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:84%
they're separate and never
the twain shall meet.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.983 align:middle line:84%
that makes them
strange, is the sense

00:08:48.983 --> 00:08:50.900 align:middle line:84%
there's some kind of
connection between what's

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:84%
going on inside
your head and things

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.640 align:middle line:84%
elsewhere, elsewhere
in space and in time.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So what this view of
quantum mechanics provides

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
is a way of framing what these
strange experiences are like.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And it reframes it from
somehow magically information

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.030 align:middle line:84%
is getting inside my head from
signals or forces or something

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:84%
into a different view,
which is that in a sense,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:84%
your head, yes, is here,
but it's also spread out.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.437 align:middle line:84%
Spread out through
space and time.

00:09:20.437 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>> What I think happens
in near-death experiences,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and maybe in death also,
is that prior to that,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
while the brain's functioning,
metabolism is occurring,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:84%
quantum coherence and quantum
competition is being driven

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:90%
by the metabolism.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:84%
When that ends, when
the blood stops flowing,

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.950 align:middle line:84%
the quantum information leaks
out to the universe at large.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Because it exists
in the Planck scale.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
It exists at the most
fundamental level.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Even during normal
consciousness,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
it's occurring at the most
basic level of the universe.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But the Planck scale,
the fundamental level

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.663 align:middle line:90%
between our ears in the brain.

00:09:52.663 --> 00:09:54.830 align:middle line:84%
But when the coherence is
lost, it kind of leaks out

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.360 align:middle line:90%
to the universe at large.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
dissipate entirely,

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:90%
because of entanglement.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And plus, the universe
is probably holographic,

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
so it remains with
a phase relationship

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and can persist, at least at
a subconscious dreamlike state

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:90%
outside the body.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Spread out through
space and time.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm able to
get a telepathic impression

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.130 align:middle line:84%
from somebody at
a distance, it's

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle line:84%
not because I somehow
jumped out there and got it,

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:84%
but because at some deep level,
my head and the other person's

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.533 align:middle line:90%
head are co-located.

00:10:25.533 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> We've become entitled all
the time when you communicate

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:90%
telepathically.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Those experiences
are so striking,

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I literally can
read your thoughts

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.482 align:middle line:90%
if I become entangled with you.

00:10:37.482 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:90%
And such things happen.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:84%
There are distant
viewing experiments.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:84%
There are even
experiments now that you

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.280 align:middle line:84%
are seeing light flashes
and your brain potential

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
picks up the signature of
those light flashes, what

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:84%
is called evoked
potential, that can

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
be measured in an EEG machine
connected to your brain.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And I am sitting over
there, no light flashes,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I cannot see you, and
still, my brain potential,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.490 align:middle line:84%
because I'm correlated with
you in terms of intention.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:84%
I intend to be
directly communicative

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:90%
with your experiences.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:84%
That intention
produces me, gives me

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:84%
the capability of simultaneously
having the similar brain

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:90%
potential in my brain.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.340 align:middle line:84%
It was first done
by Jacobo Grinberg

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.330 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Mexico, and now

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
repeated by Peter
Fenwick in London.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's say you wanted
to, you have interest in this

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:84%
notion of entangled
minds, entangled bodies.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.640 align:middle line:84%
How would you demonstrate
that in the lab?

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:84%
The way that we do it
is, we take two people.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.130 align:middle line:84%
We simply ask them to
keep each other in mind.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:84%
We entangle their minds
by asking them to do.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Just keep each other in mind.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the mental equivalent
of a physics experiment

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.930 align:middle line:90%
where you're entangling people.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
You wire them both
up physiologically.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:84%
You might measure the
heart rate in both of them,

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:84%
brainwaves, skin
conductance, you

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.540 align:middle line:84%
may measure what's
happening physiologically.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Then you separate
them into two places,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:84%
so that no ordinary
form of sensory leakage

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.200 align:middle line:90%
can pass between them.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So they can't interact then
any more by conventional means,

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.680 align:middle line:84%
as it's done in a
physics experiment.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And now you do the equivalent
of poke one of them

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and see if the
other one flinches.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And if it turns out that
you can poke that person

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and that person flinches as a
result, or at the right time,

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
that's a way of demonstrating
that they are still entangled,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:84%
even though they are no
longer in the same place.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:10%
What we're looking
at is the brainwave.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.830 align:middle line:10%
This is the raw brainwave
electroencephalogram.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.650 align:middle line:10%
This is skin conductance,
skin conductance level,

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle line:10%
and this is respiration.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.090 align:middle line:84%
It's going to run
all by itself now.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>> They had wired me up
and locked me in this room,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.770 align:middle line:84%
a massive multi-ton Faraday cage
used by the military to isolate

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:90%
sensitive defense computers.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:84%
The shielded room
was riding on springs

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:84%
to further eliminate all sonic,
vibrational and electromagnetic

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:90%
interference.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, Mark sat in another
room watching a monitor.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:84%
When my picture flashed
on, he was to focus on me.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Computers collected our
unconscious responses

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
to see if somehow, some
way we were entangled.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> You can see when
the sending occurs,

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.270 align:middle line:84%
there's a big
arousal effect here.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is descending side,
and this is the receiving side.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking for, is
on this side, a response.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.610 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.145 align:middle line:84%
Possible that that
is a response.

00:13:35.145 --> 00:13:51.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm pulling the data from
these computers into this one,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:84%
where I'll be able
to do the analysis.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:84%
We ran a session with
a sender and receiver.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:84%
The sender is the red line,
the receiver is the blue line.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Beginning of the
stimulus is here at 100

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.970 align:middle line:90%
and the end is at 200.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So what we're looking at is 10
seconds before the stimulus,

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:84%
the stimulus itself,
and then 10 seconds

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:90%
after the stimulus in each case.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So here, we're finding
the skin conductance

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:90%
relaxing and then meandering.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:84%
The stimulus occurs and there's
a big reaction in the sender,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:90%
which is what we would expect.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And what interestingly,
here's the receiver relaxing.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.080 align:middle line:84%
The stimulus occurs,
and suddenly he

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:90%
starts relaxing a lot quicker.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And gets to the end of the
period and stops relaxing.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So this is somewhat unusual, in
that you wouldn't expect skin

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:90%
conductance to suddenly drop.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.750 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I did
an analysis to see

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:84%
whether this is a
meaningful drop,

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.630 align:middle line:90%
and it turns out that it is.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Significantly faster drop than
you would expect by chance.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of unusual.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So on average, I would say that
looking at this one session

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.190 align:middle line:84%
with two people, it looks like
the receiver is responding

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:84%
to what the sender was trying
to do, to mentally connect.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.850 align:middle line:84%
In a large scale experiment,
we would do many sessions

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
We might be doing 30 or
40 sessions like this,

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and then combine all
of the data together

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.720 align:middle line:84%
to see whether we're
dealing with something

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:90%
which is true on average.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.752 align:middle line:84%
But that's the result
of this experiment.

00:15:24.752 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> A colleague of
mine, Alex Wendt,

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:84%
is a sociology professor
at Ohio State University.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's writing a
book on the premise

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.690 align:middle line:84%
that quantum
consciousness exists

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and there is subconscious
quantum entanglement

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:90%
between people.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
case, then it also

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:84%
exists among groups of people,
societies, governments,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:90%
politics and so forth.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And the implications of that,
for this subconscious quantum

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
entanglement interactions among
people and groups of people,

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:84%
has profound
implications on the way

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:84%
the world runs, on the way
society and governments

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.690 align:middle line:90%
and politics go on.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>> If we claim, for
example, based on research,

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:84%
that group meditation lowers
crime, prevents terrorism,

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:84%
even stops open warfare
in war-torn areas,

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
which is absolutely
true every time,

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:84%
that's such important research
it needs to be done again

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and again, published
again and again,

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.248 align:middle line:90%
presented again and again.

00:16:20.248 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a little bit
more involved now

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:84%
with the application of
the knowledge of unity,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:90%
how that applies to life.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:84%
How it can be accessed
through meditation

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and harnessed and utilized
through group meditation.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>> At the end of
"Entangled Minds,"

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I take five or six classes of
experiments that I've created

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.220 align:middle line:84%
or that I've analyzed, to
come up with a single number

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:84%
of the odds against chance
for telepathy in the conscious

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:51.070 align:middle line:84%
state, in the dream state, for
entangled minds and bodies,

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:84%
for mind matter interaction, for
those classes of experiments,

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
which is roughly
1,500 experiments.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And the overall figure
is 10 to the 104 to 1.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's a big number.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at some point,
you have to say, well,

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:07.900 align:middle line:84%
the evidence from
these experiments

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:84%
is so large against chance,
that chance as an explanation

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:90%
is simply not viable.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:19.089 align:middle line:84%
>> The difference between
ignorance and enlightenment is,

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
ignorance always uses reality
for a predictable outcome.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So no one in our life is
ever the love of our life.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:84%
No one in our life is ever
the angel in our life.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:84%
No one our life is ever
the bad person in our life.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:90%
No one.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:84%
It's only how we were at
two predictable emotions

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:90%
that we are addicted to.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Ingenius has none of them.
