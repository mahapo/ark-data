>> We can't just say, well,
it only took 20 nanoseconds

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:84%
for this healing to take
place, because we don't in that

person's subjective world what
the process was that got him up

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:84%
to that point of acceptance,
or what got them to the point

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:84%
where they could surrender
themselves to a greater order.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And so what appears
to be a nanosecond

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:84%
could be a person's
journey to acceptance.

When the soul emerges, when
a person begins to wake up,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:90%
they weigh.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:84%
They begin to weigh
what they know

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and what's working
for them against what

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.070 align:middle line:84%
is that inner urge
and that inner drive.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
it's a clean cut.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:90%
They make the break.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.940 align:middle line:84%
They understand
what it is, and they

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:84%
begin to gain knowledge
and apply that knowledge.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Other people have to have
their system fall apart.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
They have to go through the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:84%

based on how the person's wired.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So the tragedy in
one sense is really

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:90%
just the death of an old self.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:90%
And it allows then a birth.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And the birthing
process at times

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:84%
can be difficult,
because it's painful.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And what's painful about
it more than anything else

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:84%
is that we no longer are
producing the same thoughts

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:90%
that make the same chemicals.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:84%
We're breaking the addiction
to all those agreements

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:90%
chemically.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.160 align:middle line:84%
That is an uncomfortable
state for the human being,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
because they can't connect
to any person, place, thing,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:84%
or event out in their world,
and because that that discomfort

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:84%
gives them the sense of
no relation to anything.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:84%
That is borderline
nervous breakdown.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:90%
It's borderline insanity.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.993 align:middle line:84%
Because you look for some
evidence in your life

00:02:20.993 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing
the right thing.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere you look
for evidence in your life

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle line:84%
is with the people you've had
all those agreements with.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So you can't even turn
and talk to those people,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to ask you
to go back to the same person,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
so that they can keep
that agreement intact.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:84%
If the person has the knowledge
to be able to understand that,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and they can ride their
way all the way through it,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
they'll begin to understand
that a new self is emerging.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And those old patterns
will literally crumble.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:84%
They'll literally
disconnect in the brain.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And it'll give
them an opportunity

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:90%
to give birth to a new self.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
That new self will have a whole
new set of people in their life

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:90%
equal to who they've become.

>> When a person says,
do I create my reality?

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.270 align:middle line:84%
The answer is, but you
already are creating it.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Who you are is made up of the
reality that you are currently.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
To change that
would be to change

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:84%
one of those concepts of
people, because you became

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.800 align:middle line:84%
expanded that you've brought
into your neurological makeup

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:90%
an idea.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.670 align:middle line:84%
That new idea suddenly
augments present reality.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And because the idea
is now in your mind,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:84%
it's in your frontal
lobe, its reality forms.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly you go, wow, I
just had this great experience.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.963 align:middle line:84%
I had this idea, and then this
wonderful thing happened to me.

00:03:53.963 --> 00:03:54.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what was that?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
The answer is you
created reality.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, what did I create it from?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.880 align:middle line:90%
A source from an idea.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, why don't I do
that all the time?

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:90%
But you have.

you live, what you look
like, what you wear,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
who you talk to today, what
you're going to do tomorrow;

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:84%
you have all created this as
fundamentally your reality.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So everybody in your life
is an aspect of yourself.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And what you did is
you simply added to it.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:84%
You added a new
reality to that mix.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:84%

idea to the fish

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.085 align:middle line:84%
that it's a novel idea to
ask for a drink of water.

00:04:37.085 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So the fish asked
for a drink of water.

laughing, because the fish

is in the water.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of like saying,
how do I create my reality?

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, you are the reality.

That is something that Eric

of the Nobel Prize in
Medicine and Science,

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:90%
said very eloquently at a talk.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.900 align:middle line:84%

as this very rigid

it's carefully engineered

>> When people have a
mystical experience,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:84%
what usually happens--
how they describe,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.470 align:middle line:84%
is that they begin to lose the
usual sense of material reality

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.895 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if they go
far enough and they

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:22.520 align:middle line:84%
achieve a sense of absolute
unitary experience, then

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
all of the material world
as we typically know it,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:90%
basically goes away.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about there
is an experience of just pure--

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
being pure awareness,
pure consciousness.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's not-- it's
not necessarily

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
tied to anything material, and
because those experiences have

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:84%
been described in
extremely real terms,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:84%
meaning that when people have
that experience they perceive

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:84%
it to represent a more
fundamental level of reality

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:84%
than our everyday
material reality

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
that we normally live
in; it creates a very

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.600 align:middle line:90%
big philosophical problem.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Because when we actually
try to evaluate what is real

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and how we know what is
real, my colleagues and I

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
have ultimately come
to the conclusion

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that the only way to
really make a determination

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:84%
is based on how real it feels,
what the sense of it feels.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything ultimately is
reduced to that experience.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
How real of an
experience does it feel?

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
How much does it feel
like absolute reality?

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Well in that case, when we look
at the mystical experiences,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
they really are associated
with an experience of much more

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.170 align:middle line:84%
fundamental reality than what
our everyday reality is like.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even when
they're no longer having

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.880 align:middle line:84%
that mystical
experience, they still

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
perceive that reality
to be the more real,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle line:84%
to represent the more truer
form, the more fundamental form

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And the material
world that we live in,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a more
secondary reality for them.

>> The reason why people
are attracted to psychic

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.710 align:middle line:84%
experiences or mystical
experiences is because they

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.820 align:middle line:84%
feel it has enormous meaning,
like more meaning than usual.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is typically

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:84%
a feeling of connectedness,
a merging of your ego

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:90%
with something else.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And why that should
create this internal sense

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that it's important is
not entirely clear to me.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes a single
psychic experience

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.343 align:middle line:90%
can be life-transforming.

00:08:11.343 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Change is always interesting,
because it's like walking

across a stream.

You have a good idea

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
You say, there's life
on the other side.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I can predict everything
on this side of the river.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I can predict actions

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I can predict the comings and

And so we venture
across the river.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And as we start
entering into the river,

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:84%
we realize that it's cold, and
the water has a strong current,

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:90%
and is dangerous.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that we stop
to analyze how we're feeling,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.890 align:middle line:90%
we lose sight of the other side.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that
happens, we rush

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:84%
back to what's comfortable,
and what's familiar,

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and what's common.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we can say when we
do that, we'll see that change

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.090 align:middle line:90%
just didn't feel right.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Well that feeling
we were relying on

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:84%
was a feeling based
on reaffirming

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.970 align:middle line:90%
our old personality.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%

ability to hold a thought,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and to hold an ideal, and
to hold a vision in spite

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:17.180 align:middle line:84%

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:90%
to a greater reality.

boundaries are contracted,

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:84%
we become identified

we become unhappy.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea
then is to shift,

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.190 align:middle line:90%
to extend our boundaries.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:10%
And then whenever we have
expanded the boundaries,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:10%
we are in that extended bigger
self, non-ordinary state

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:10%

And there is just
sudden realization.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Now you come back
from the rabbit hole.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And you start to perform
in this world of illusion,

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:84%
that you are never going to

we're unable to see because
we're processing mind from

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.410 align:middle line:90%
the familiar.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
To learn knowledge means
we're learning new things.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And to learn new
things means we're

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.500 align:middle line:84%
gathering information and
creating the circuitry

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:84%
now to begin to develop
the sensitivity,

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.970 align:middle line:84%
to begin to see things
for the first time.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>> We are entangled.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
If you want to call it
quantum entanglement, fine.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:10%
But we are entangled.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And there is no real
separation between us,

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
so that what we do to another,
we do to an aspect of ourself.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do we not see
the entanglement?

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Because evolution has
pushed us to not see it.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And we get quite good
at not seeing it.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.050 align:middle line:84%
This sensory input
is designing and it's

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:84%
constructing this image of the
world in which the things are

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.980 align:middle line:90%
separate.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.693 align:middle line:84%
But we know through experiments,
we know through experience,

00:18:57.693 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:90%
that they're separate.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:84%
But at some level, they're
not so separate after all.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>> We're finding non-locality
everywhere-- in our bodies,

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:09.050 align:middle line:90%
in space, from stars.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:84%
In regions of the zero point
field, everything is connected.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this
involvement in everything.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:90%
We are our world.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no out there out there.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:84%
There's no place where we end
and everything else begins.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> You take this notion
of an entangled universe,

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and you apply it to
human experience,

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
because human experience is
part of the universe as well.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, let's assume
that experience is entangled.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Then how would it manifest?

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And we can start
going through ways

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle line:90%
in which it could manifest.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:84%
If there's a connection
with another mind,

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:90%
we call it telepathy.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:84%
If there's a connection to some
other object somewhere else,

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.040 align:middle line:90%
we'd call it clairvoyance.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.900 align:middle line:84%
If there's a connection that
happens that transcend time,

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:90%
we call it precognition.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.265 align:middle line:84%
If there's a connection in which
my intention is expressed out

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:00.890 align:middle line:84%
in the world some
way, we might call it

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:84%
psychokinesis, or
distant healing,

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:90%
or something of that sort.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So you can go through
a list of perhaps 12

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
kinds of psychic experience
that have gotten labels

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:90%
over the years, like telepathy.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.300 align:middle line:84%
But this is really just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I think entanglement
and collapse in one system,

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:84%
inducing collapse another,
is exactly what happens

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:90%
in para-psychological phenomena.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's also true that
time can go backwards.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So they don't even have
to be simultaneously.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:84%
One can occur before
or after the other.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And near-death experiences,
particularly when

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:84%
patients report
leaving their body

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.622 align:middle line:84%
and floating above
them, their bodies

00:20:40.622 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:84%
watching themselves
being worked on

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and then returning to their
body, could be due to the fact

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.480 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is
ultimately a process

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:84%
in fundamental
space-time geometry.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And when the coherence
driving the system

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
stops due to the metabolic
insult to the brain,

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
the information is still
in fundamental space-time

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:90%
geometry, which is everywhere.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So it would tend to
start to dissipate.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.010 align:middle line:84%
However due to
quantum entanglement,

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
would tend to stay
somewhat localized,

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and float above, maybe go
out in the waiting room

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and visit with relatives
which has been reported

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:90%
in near-death experiences.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But then when the body
is resuscitated, revived,

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and the metabolic drive
in the brain resumes,

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:84%
the information returns
to its host, the brain.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>> We are all connected.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think the most
fundamental thing is we're all

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.290 align:middle line:90%
connected by an energy field.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:84%
We swim in a sea of
light, basically,

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:90%
which is the zero point field.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And I say, first
of all, you have

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.387 align:middle line:84%
to get away from the whole
idea of separateness.

00:21:39.387 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Because separateness is the
biggest problem in the world

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever way we observe the
world around us is what comes

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.312 align:middle line:90%
back to us.

00:21:48.312 --> 00:21:49.761 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:49.761 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>> One then begins to see
others as a part of themselves.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
One begins to see that it's best
just to love others, and not

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:12.120 align:middle line:84%
judge them, that what you
do to build another actually

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.770 align:middle line:90%
builds yourself.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:15.660 align:middle line:84%
You begin to see that
you're connected,

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:90%
you're part of a large family.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Loving one's neighbor I think
is based upon the recognition

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:90%
of neighbor as oneself.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately of course, when
consciousness is developed

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and education is working, one
will perceive other as oneself,

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.760 align:middle line:90%
because we are all one unity.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:90%
There is only one consciousness.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:90%
There's only one unified field.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Jesus' teaching love your
neighbor as yourself was

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:84%
actually a teaching about
the higher frequencies

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of reality.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he didn't
say love your neighbor,

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:90%
because it's a good thing to do.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Be nice to your neighbor,
and God will reward you.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.920 align:middle line:84%
He was, I suppose, you
could say practicing

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.430 align:middle line:84%
enlightened self-interest
at its best.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.732 align:middle line:84%
Because what he knew,
that with the intent

00:23:05.732 --> 00:23:07.440 align:middle line:84%
which we call the
observer in the quantum

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.370 align:middle line:84%
world, the intent of the
observer towards another, what

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.330 align:middle line:84%
you express towards another, is
what you create for yourself.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you express love, or
hate, or harm to another,

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:90%
you're creating it.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:28.343 align:middle line:84%
And the prime beneficiary
in all creation is yourself.

00:23:28.343 --> 00:23:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So when he said
love your neighbor

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and do good to those who
hate you and so forth,

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.428 align:middle line:84%
he was actually paying tribute
to the role of the observer

00:23:36.428 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:90%
in everything that we do.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the consequences
of this entanglement issue is

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:49.170 align:middle line:84%
that every thought is received
by every other person who can

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:90%
think.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts have
action, have intentions,

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:84%
have consequences that
spread out into the world.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:84%
From a personal basis, my
thought is a drop in the ocean.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So probably what I think
doesn't matter a whole lot.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:84%
But if there are
a billion of me,

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and we happen to be thinking
along the same lines,

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:14.730 align:middle line:84%
it probably will be picked up
and influence other thinking

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.140 align:middle line:90%
creatures.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, if this
line of thinking plays out,

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
then one of the
consequences may be

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
that we need to be more
responsible for our thoughts.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.010 align:middle line:84%

None of us are innocent
in that regard.

If there's something
out there we don't like,

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:47.350 align:middle line:84%
we can't really turn
our backs on it,

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.590 align:middle line:84%
because we're co-creators,
somehow or other.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do
the right things

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:01.593 align:middle line:84%
to try to get the future

wherever there is consciousness,
is merely consciousness

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:10%
by virtue of the fact
that my consciousness,

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:10%
your consciousness
are ultimately that.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.020 align:middle line:84%

We are really
united at our core.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately the
understanding that's emerging

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:31.290 align:middle line:84%
will be that there is only one
consciousness in this room,

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and it is you, and it is me, and
it is each and every one of us.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.620 align:middle line:84%
We individualize
our consciousness

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
through the filter of
our nervous system.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.730 align:middle line:84%
But the consciousness itself,
our very inner subjectivity,

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:84%
the self in the big
sense, that is universal.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that, knowing
it through experience,

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.640 align:middle line:84%
is called enlightenment, and
has been called enlightenment

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.440 align:middle line:90%
through the ages.
