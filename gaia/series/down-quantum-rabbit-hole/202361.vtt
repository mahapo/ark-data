00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.690 align:middle line:84%
a god of horticulture,
a god of irrigation.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And the temple priests were
the scribes and technologists

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:84%
investigating these
fields of knowledge.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Greece, philosophers
asking the questions

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
of why are we here,
develop the theory

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
of the atom, celestial
movements, and human ethics.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Medieval Europe--
the Western church

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:84%
arose to a position
of supreme power.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Kingmaker, landowner,
and purveyor

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:84%
of the truth, the Church
took it upon themselves

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to be the one knower
of everything.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.380 align:middle line:90%
The dogma was law.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it probably goes
back to a conviction that some

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:84%
of the books of the scriptures,
like the Book of Genesis which

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:84%
deals with beginnings, is
actually telling us about

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:90%
the origins of the world.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, in fact, any biblical
scholar will tell you--

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:90%
and this is not news--

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
that the Book of
Genesis was never

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.530 align:middle line:84%
meant to be about the
origins of the world.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:84%
But many churchmen believed
that in the Book of Genesis

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:84%
you had actual
sort of live news,

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.370 align:middle line:84%
like CNN, about the
beginnings of creation.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:10%
And therefore you had many
people down through the ages,

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:36.200 align:middle line:10%
like the famous Archbishop
James Ussher in Ireland in 1650,

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:10%
who calculated all the ages
of the patriarchs back along

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.080 align:middle line:10%
and worked out to
his own satisfaction

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:10%
that the creation of the world
occurred in the year 4004

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:10%
BC on the 17th of September
at 9 o'clock in the morning.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Yet science had moved forward
and now challenged the dogma

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:10%
that the Earth was the
center of the universe.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:10%
Copernicus, Bruno,
and Galileo all

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:10%
felt the heavy
hand of the Church.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:84%
The tragedy-- unable to
suppress science anymore,

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.180 align:middle line:84%
the Church and
science divided up

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:90%
knowledge and human endeavor.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Descartes invented dualism.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.580 align:middle line:10%
The Church had the
unseen, science the seen.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:90%
And materialism was born.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Descartes invented dualism
to avoid the problem between

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:90%
the Church and science.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> A long time ago, we made
the decision to separate sort

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:84%
of spirit from science
and that science--

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and we were in this
low asymmetry state.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Because there, the
effects of most humans,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:84%
of their consciousness,
is very small.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we were able to
learn how to do science.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But now we've
learned, and now we

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.990 align:middle line:84%
can take on the richer task
of learning to do science

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.780 align:middle line:84%
when consciousness,
a significant amount

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, is
part of the experiment.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And uneasy truths.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Scientists were no
longer being bound,

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and they reacted
with a vengeance.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:84%
All the unseen is
fantasy, delusion.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
We are strictly little
machines running

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:84%
in a predictable machine
universe governed

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.290 align:middle line:90%
by strict, immutable laws.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:90%
The Church pushed back.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Soulless scientists
were condemned to hell.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Back in the 17th century,
we came out of a period of time

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
where we saw the
universe as this living,

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:84%
vibrant entity to that of
the world as a machine.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And with that
scientists came along

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.380 align:middle line:84%
such as Descartes and Newton,
which solidified that concept,

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
because they were describing
science and mathematics

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
of a non-living world
of inanimate objects

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and did some very
beautiful calculations,

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and enhanced our understanding
of non-living systems.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Descartes really looked
at the world as a machine.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:84%
He was very
interested in clocks.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is they
applied this model

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:84%
of a clock or a wind-up toy
soldier to living systems

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.680 align:middle line:84%
as if we understood the parts,
the different components

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:84%
of the system well
enough we would

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.560 align:middle line:84%
understand how the system
works, as in a clock.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The key underlying assumption
that most scientists still work

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.160 align:middle line:84%
under is that we live in
a clockwork universe--

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:84%
we live in a
mechanistic universe

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that is conceived of
as gears and knobs

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:90%
sort of linking together.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
That is going to change because
we know that that is not true.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:84%
We know from a physics
point of view it's not true.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
The impact of that change
is still somewhat difficult

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to guess, but one
of the areas that I

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:84%
know is going to
make a big impact

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
is in how we understand the
nature of human experience,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.820 align:middle line:84%
because human experience in a
clockwork world doesn't fit.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in mainstream
psychology for many years

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
the very idea of an
internal experience

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.490 align:middle line:90%
was considered to be laughable.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.290 align:middle line:84%
There was no
internal experience.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:90%
It was explained away.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it
was explained away

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:84%
is because of this idea of
living in a clockwork world.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Darwin countered the
creator's nothing, nowhere.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.660 align:middle line:84%
We are random mutations,
simply a carrier

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:84%
of DNA's relentless quest for
more in a meaningless universe.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, both science and
religion were hitting the wall.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
If everything was mechanistic
and God was the only creator,

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:84%
then what were we
humans supposed to do?

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Science dug ever deeper
into a dead universe

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and stumbled upon and
unlocked a mystery.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> In the material
way of thinking,

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:84%
what happens is that we
always shortchange ourselves

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.970 align:middle line:84%
because we cannot understand
love, justice, or even meaning.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So we think that the
world is meaningless,

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:84%
love and justice are
figments of our imagination

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:84%
which has no meaning
in the first place.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems that on
the one hand, say,

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:15.760 align:middle line:84%
physics is going to be
urging that we look at people

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:84%
as if they were
mechanical devices.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And other kinds of
discourses we have

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.465 align:middle line:84%
about love, about literature,
about art, something like that

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
asking us to look

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:84%
at people in a very
different way than that.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm interested
at the point at which

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:90%
those two bang into each other.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in the points at
which those two points of view

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that one can take on the world
come into conflict with one

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:84%
another, come into
collision with one another.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm interested in
studying those collisions.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> In tiny corners
of space and time,

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.380 align:middle line:84%
scientists found unfathomable
energy and mind-numbing

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.670 align:middle line:90%
mysteries--

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:84%
mysteries that suggest
we are all connected,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.840 align:middle line:84%
that the physical universe
is essentially non-physical.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Time and space are
just constructs

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:90%
of this non-materialness.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that by looking at
where this intersection between

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:10%
science and religion is is going
to be our best way of really

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:10%
being able to address those
issues and to go ahead and do

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:21.340 align:middle line:10%
science appropriately and
morally and respectfully

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:10%
but also preserve who we are
as human beings because while

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.180 align:middle line:10%
science can do a lot
of things for us,

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:10%
it still doesn't necessarily
change who we are as human

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:10%
beings, which probably is the
ultimate reason why we have

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:10%
our problems.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Bringing mind and matter back
together again is not so easy

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.110 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:84%
We've-- the problem is we've
been trained so well in science

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.190 align:middle line:84%
to work with the idea that mind
is outside of science that we

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:84%
don't have any way of testing
to find mind in science.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand the objection
from physicists who say that

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.040 align:middle line:84%
trying to link the spookiness
of quantum mechanics

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:84%
to the slipperiness of psychic
phenomena is illegitimate.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And my response is that I
understand the objection.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:84%
One is mathematically
precise and able

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to be replicated easily
in the laboratory,

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.119 align:middle line:84%
and the other one
is very slippery is

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:84%
full of psychological
complexities and all kinds

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:84%
of stuff including a history
of charlatanism and imbeciles

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of stuff.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that that's
there, so, of course,

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.920 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't-- you'd want to
stiff arm the competition.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.110 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
you look clearly

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:36.790 align:middle line:84%
at what is the fundamental thing
that both of these realms say.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.294 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about a
form of interconnectedness.

00:17:40.294 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And today, renegade
scientists are meeting with

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:90%
religious leaders.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Conferences pushing forward a
meeting of science and spirit

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:84%
are springing up as the
20th century blew open

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.070 align:middle line:90%
the doors of a mechanistic view.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:10%
Will the 21st century
blow down the iron wall

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.250 align:middle line:10%
between the church
and laboratory?

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:84%
This is your Is News Real
reporter signing off.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that there must
be a scientific explanation

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:90%
for spirituality.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's been
a good one until recently.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.810 align:middle line:84%
To me, the only one
that makes sense

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:84%
is that proto consciousness,
platonic values, goodness,

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.320 align:middle line:84%
truth exist at this fundamental
level of spacetime geometry,

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
which can influence our
actions if we're open to them,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and interconnects us to all
other beings to the universe

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.500 align:middle line:90%
at large.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:42.498 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.498 --> 00:18:44.797 align:middle line:90%
>> It's time to get wise.

00:18:44.797 --> 00:18:50.401 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Science creates the stories
that we live by, and science

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.600 align:middle line:10%
has told us a very bleak story.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:84%
It's told us that we're some
sort of genetic mistake,

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
that we have genes
that use us basically

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.850 align:middle line:84%
to move on to the
next generation,

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:90%
and that we randomly mutate.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:84%
It's said that we are
outside of our universe,

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are alone,
that we are separate,

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and that we are this
sort of lonely mistake

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
on a lonely planet
in a lonely universe.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And that informs our
view of the world.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:84%
It informs our
view of ourselves.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're now realizing
that this view,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:84%
this view of
separateness, is one

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:90%
of the most destructive things.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:38.614 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that creates
all the problems in the world.

00:19:38.614 --> 00:19:41.542 align:middle line:90%
>> It's time to get wise.

00:19:41.542 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're now realizing
that that paradigm is wrong,

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:90%
that we aren't separate.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.160 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:90%
We're all together.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:84%
At the very nether most element
of our being, we are connected.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And so we're under-- trying
to understand and absorb what

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.480 align:middle line:90%
are the implications of that.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.885 align:middle line:84%
What does this really
mean to me in my life?

00:20:03.885 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> We need a new
spiritual milieu.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.130 align:middle line:84%
We need a new spiritual
way of understanding

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:84%
the nature of what it
is to be a human being

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:15.190 align:middle line:84%
because the old ways, the old
mythologies, the old monarchy

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
king, god versus the old
lawful scientist way of doing

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:90%
everything are dead.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:90%
They need to be buried.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.210 align:middle line:84%
We need a new
realm, a new vision,

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and I think quantum
physics if anything

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:84%
could help us get a step
up in the right direction.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the reasons why
among them is a wide variety

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:84%
of things that I
could have done,

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:84%
that I settled on psychic
phenomenon is because I

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:41.020 align:middle line:84%
convinced myself through my
own experiments and through

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:84%
watching the experiments of
others that these effects are

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.600 align:middle line:90%
real.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And if they are
real, then it means

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:84%
that the large bulk of
science has completely

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:84%
sidestepped something of
profound interest and probably

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:90%
profound importance.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Because anytime science
has ignored something

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:84%
or partitioned off
this area of the world

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.040 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
look at, it means

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.975 align:middle line:84%
that we're not getting a
comprehensive view of reality.

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Every civilization is a
reflection of its knowledge.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Civilization is based upon
knowledge, the prevailing

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:90%
paradigm.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Now you look at the globe today,
our rainbow-colored globe,

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:23.610 align:middle line:84%
you see arbitrary divisions
among nations, among peoples.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.950 align:middle line:84%
These are completely
random, completely arbitrary

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:84%
based upon who owned at what
period of time in history.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody in
the future looks back

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:84%
upon our globe of
today, they're going

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
to say this is a fragmented
world based upon a fragmented

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:90%
worldview.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a quite
noticeable shift in the thrust

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
of the teachings of Jesus from
say the teachings of the Old

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:90%
Testament.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
For instance, he
said it was said

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
to the man of old, quoting
Moses, an eye for an eye

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and a tooth for a
tooth, but I say

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:90%
to you forgive your enemies.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.885 align:middle line:84%
And he always stressed how
important that thought was.

00:22:02.885 --> 00:22:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In the new paradigm, it would
be certainly a lot different

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:06.950 align:middle line:90%
than it is now.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:84%
We-- I'm just thinking
of how any garbage that

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.180 align:middle line:84%
comes into anyone's
mind, any garbage

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:90%
is strewn out onto the airwaves.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Children grew up hearing
garbage, playing garbage.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And every time you take an
extreme view, every time

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.040 align:middle line:84%
a little man kills another
little man in a computer game,

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.085 align:middle line:84%
something has changed in
the brain of that kid.

00:22:34.085 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Anytime a worldview changes,
it will affect behavior.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.585 align:middle line:90%
It affects society.

00:22:39.585 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:90%
It affects economy.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Everything reflects the sense
of what the worldview is.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So if we imagine the worldview
as a giant machine that's

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.780 align:middle line:84%
there to be exploited, then
that's the way we'll do.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what will happen.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.048 align:middle line:90%
That's the way we'll operate.

00:22:53.048 --> 00:22:54.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why business
goes crazy sometimes

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:84%
because the nature of the game
is get as much as you can.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Once-- if that changes,
probably the closest parallel

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I can think of is
the ecology movement.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Before an ecology
movement, the notion

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.170 align:middle line:84%
of sustainability,
of rare resources,

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:17.660 align:middle line:84%
of paying attention to the world
as an organism was laughable,

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.638 align:middle line:84%
and we saw the-- we still
see the effects worldwide

00:23:20.638 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:84%
when people don't pay
attention to the fact

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that we have a-- we're
living in a closed space.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a limited
amount of stuff to use.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:90%
That makes a big difference.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So how will it make a
difference if people

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.670 align:middle line:84%
imagine that the ecology
extends into the mind?

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, it might be kind of
a closed space there, too.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:84%
You start making it
dirty and putting

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.540 align:middle line:84%
in bunch of bad stuff
in there, you're

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.495 align:middle line:84%
going to end up with a
bad mind environment.

00:23:44.495 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that the
children are our canaries,

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and they are like the canaries
in the mines that were keeling

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:84%
over to warn the miners
that they better get out.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I think some of the things we're
seeing with the children today

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.880 align:middle line:84%
is a sign that the culture
is in the wrong paradigm

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.106 align:middle line:84%
and not appreciating
the power of thought.

00:24:06.106 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It may very well be that
what's going on inside of you

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:84%
in your brain, in
your nervous system,

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
in your nature of
observation how memory works,

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.810 align:middle line:84%
how mind works, it may very well
be that what is happening there

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:24.210 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of observer matter
interrelationship which is

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:84%
indeed making
things real for you,

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.700 align:middle line:84%
affecting how you
perceive reality.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not changing that
reality out there.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.160 align:middle line:84%
You're not changing big
chairs and big trucks

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.887 align:middle line:84%
and bulldozers and
rockets taking off.

00:24:37.887 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:90%
You're not changing those.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But you're changing
how you perceive things

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and maybe how you
think about the things,

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
how you feel about things,
how you sense the world.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The infinite information that
the brain is processing every

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:84%
single second tells us that
there's more to the world than

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.850 align:middle line:90%
we're perceiving.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:02.580 align:middle line:84%
However, every single time
we're immersed in an experience

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:90%
with our senses--

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.890 align:middle line:84%
seeing, smelling,
tasting, feeling--

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
as we're immersed
centrally in our reality.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We know nothing
about reality,

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and all of our sense of
so-called reality out there is

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.190 align:middle line:84%
filtered through
our sense organs.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:24.078 align:middle line:90%


00:25:24.078 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The brain processes 400
billion bits of information

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:84%
a second, but we're only
aware of 2,000 of those.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.550 align:middle line:84%
That means that reality
is happening in the brain

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.350 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:45.328 align:middle line:90%


00:25:45.328 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>> You should try it.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.154 align:middle line:90%


00:25:49.154 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:90%
How do I know what I'm doing?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.475 align:middle line:90%
I and the vase are one.

00:25:55.475 --> 00:25:58.046 align:middle line:90%
Hey, might help your work, too.

00:25:58.046 --> 00:26:00.038 align:middle line:90%

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.958 align:middle line:90%
Alternative reality.

nebulous nothing,

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.490 align:middle line:84%
touchy feely world of
shifting whatevers.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>> If it's real,
I want to see it.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.170 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Reality, what a concept.

00:26:28.187 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> What is reality, and
is it ever knowable?

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.695 align:middle line:90%


00:26:32.695 --> 00:26:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The easy answer to the
question as to whether reality

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:84%
is itself is illusory and it's
really all fuzzy and it's all

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.218 align:middle line:84%
just probabilities, the easy
answer to that would be yes.

00:26:43.218 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So if I were hurrying
off to a meeting

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.340 align:middle line:84%
instead of being interviewed
and somebody came up to me

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and pestered me on the street
and asked that question and I--

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:middle line:84%
say, yes, yes, that's
basically right.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's more complicated
than that because

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:84%
at the moment that you
interact with reality,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.580 align:middle line:84%
it does then come
into absolutely

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.740 align:middle line:90%
rock solid existence.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It's only fuzzy when you're
not interacting with it.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at some of
the modern scientific views

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:84%
of reality that have
tried to get down, down,

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:84%
down to the nitty gritty, we
see that at its ultimate level

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:84%
saying in theory or string
theory that reality is not

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:90%
solid.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly empty space.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And whatever solidity
it has seems more

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:84%
to resemble a hologram
picture rather than

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:90%
material harsh solid reality.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:52.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a shimmering
reality that seems

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.980 align:middle line:84%
to be very susceptible
to the power of thought.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Its very powerful mystical
experiences are perceivers

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
to represent a truer form of
reality and more fundamental

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.420 align:middle line:84%
levels of reality that makes
this material world really not

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:90%
mean as much.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Some people will describe
it as an illusion, which

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.487 align:middle line:84%
I think is sometimes
a little strong,

00:28:10.487 --> 00:28:12.320 align:middle line:84%
but I think the point
they're trying to make

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.290 align:middle line:84%
is that it just doesn't
have the realness,

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:84%
the quality of realness,
that these states have.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.075 align:middle line:84%
And the ultimate goal
of the mystic then,

00:28:20.075 --> 00:28:21.450 align:middle line:84%
once they've had
that experience,

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.840 align:middle line:84%
is to keep trying to get
back to that experience

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.510 align:middle line:84%
because that is
in their eyes what

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.520 align:middle line:84%
represents the fundamental
level of reality.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to go beyond
our senses to create a new

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.190 align:middle line:90%
paradigm.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Our senses determine everything
that exists in our world,

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.490 align:middle line:90%
that's the end of our world.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:84%
We have to embrace knowledge
that's unconventional,

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:90%
that's in the unseen.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And if we can wire it
in our brain first,

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.880 align:middle line:84%
then what has always existed
will now be seen by us.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.200 align:middle line:90%
That's the paradigm shift.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.032 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.032 --> 00:29:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You ever close your eyes
when you're making love.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The eyes are like the lens,
but the tape that's really

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.635 align:middle line:90%
seeing is the back of the brain.

00:29:10.635 --> 00:29:11.885 align:middle line:90%
It's called the visual cortex.

00:29:11.885 --> 00:29:12.760 align:middle line:90%
It's right back here.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like this
camera, this tape.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And the eyes are in some
senses a camcorder because they

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.830 align:middle line:84%
are taking that information
and they're storing it,

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.890 align:middle line:84%
but they're not-- you're not
really able to get it to mean

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:84%
anything until you actually
put it all together.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.075 align:middle line:84%
So in some senses, it
requires the editor's table

00:29:30.075 --> 00:29:31.700 align:middle line:84%
to really put the
whole thing together,

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to put the movie together of
what your life and your world

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:90%
is actually about.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:40.340 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The only movie that's playing
in the brain is what we have

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.540 align:middle line:90%
the ability to see.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible
our eyes, our cameras

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:56.160 align:middle line:84%
see more than what our
brain has the ability

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.750 align:middle line:90%
to consciously project?

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.852 align:middle line:90%


00:30:00.852 --> 00:30:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the way our
brain is wired up,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.650 align:middle line:84%
we only see what we
believe is possible.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:12.720 align:middle line:84%
We match patterns that
already exist within ourselves

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.190 align:middle line:90%
through conditioning.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So a wonderful story
that I believe is true

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.180 align:middle line:84%
is that when the Indians,
the Native American

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Indians on the
Caribbean Islands saw

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Columbus' ships
approaching, they

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:32.340 align:middle line:84%
could see them at all because
it was so unlike anything they

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.355 align:middle line:90%
had ever seen before.

00:30:33.355 --> 00:30:34.230 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't see it.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>> If I get out of bed in the
morning and I suddenly decide

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.540 align:middle line:84%
to take very
seriously the claim,

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:84%
which is surely a true claim,
that I don't know for sure

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:84%
if my eyes are working correctly
so that for all I know even

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.930 align:middle line:84%
though it looks like there
is a stable floor by the side

00:30:54.930 --> 00:31:00.120 align:middle line:84%
of my bed, there might be a
cliff or something like that.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:05.820 align:middle line:84%
If I am unable to order
those possibilities in terms

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.478 align:middle line:84%
of probabilities that
I assign to them,

00:31:08.478 --> 00:31:10.020 align:middle line:84%
then I'm not going
to get out of bed.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Seems to me I'm paralyzed in the
most literal sense of the word.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- I'm going to have
no idea how to literally take

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.660 align:middle line:90%
the next step.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely the
case that we know

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.200 align:middle line:84%
that my eyes might in principle
be deceiving me at any moment.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.870 align:middle line:84%
We've had experience of
people before subject

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:34.170 align:middle line:84%
to hallucinations, and
even if we didn't, we

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:37.530 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to prove
as a fundamental matter

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.630 align:middle line:90%
that our eyes never deceive us.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely right.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But when we make the decision to
get out of bed in the morning,

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:48.690 align:middle line:84%
we are assigning probabilities
to the various hypotheses

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.730 align:middle line:84%
compatible with my seeing
a floor by the bed.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.600 align:middle line:84%
One hypothesis is there
really is a floor there,

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.980 align:middle line:90%
and that's why I'm seeing it.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Another hypothesis is my seeing
the floor is a hallucination

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.238 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cliff there.

00:32:02.238 --> 00:32:03.780 align:middle line:84%
By getting out of
bed in the morning,

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.820 align:middle line:84%
you endorse one of those
hypotheses as more likely

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.620 align:middle line:90%
than another.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>> When Columbus' armada
landed in the Caribbean,

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:84%
none of the Natives were able to
see the ships even though they

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:90%
existed on the horizon.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.430 align:middle line:84%
The reason that they
never saw the ships

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.160 align:middle line:84%
was because they
had no knowledge

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:24.420 align:middle line:84%
in their brains or no experience
that clipper ships existed.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So the shaman starts to
notice that those ripples out

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.330 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean, but
he sees no ship.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.330 align:middle line:84%
But he starts to wonder
what's causing the effect.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:36.570 align:middle line:10%
So everyday he goes out and
looks and looks and looks,

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.840 align:middle line:10%
and after a period of time,
he's able to see the ships.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And once he sees the ships,
he tells everybody else

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:90%
that ships exist out there.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody trusted
and believed in him,

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:48.780 align:middle line:90%
they saw them also.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:33:01.956 align:middle line:90%


00:33:01.956 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>> By getting out of
bed in the morning,

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.330 align:middle line:84%
you endorse one of those
hypotheses is more likely than

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.130 align:middle line:90%
another.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the way we're
used to proceeding

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.580 align:middle line:90%
in our ordinary lives.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Why are you doing that?

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.340 align:middle line:90%
You have all kinds of memories.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We always perceive something
after reflection in the meter

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:90%
of memory.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.801 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.801 --> 00:33:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>> If I were to use a little
bit of poetic license and say,

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.210 align:middle line:84%
well, would happen if we could
actually tap into the different

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.520 align:middle line:84%
parts of the processing
steps of the visual--

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.740 align:middle line:84%
of how we actually
develop vision,

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.290 align:middle line:84%
the information, of course,
first strikes our eyes

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and strikes the retina.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.160 align:middle line:84%
But that information that
creates certain nerve

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.590 align:middle line:84%
signals that then connect
back to the primary parts

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.570 align:middle line:84%
of the brain where the
images really begin

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.110 align:middle line:90%
to form in the very basic--

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.732 align:middle line:84%
the primary visual cortex as
it's called, what we would see

00:33:54.732 --> 00:33:56.190 align:middle line:84%
is something a
little bit like this

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:57.750 align:middle line:84%
where we're basically
just talking

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.150 align:middle line:90%
about lines, shapes, colors.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:02.400 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing really
there that we can actually

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.422 align:middle line:84%
identify or see or
even talk about,

00:34:05.422 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and we're certainly not
conscious of this level

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:90%
of activity.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is really
just the raw data

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:13.260 align:middle line:84%
upon which is coming
in to the world,

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:84%
but we can't make
any sense of that.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So in that regard, vision
itself doesn't really

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.005 align:middle line:90%
occur in the eyes.

00:34:18.005 --> 00:34:19.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even
occur necessarily

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.480 align:middle line:84%
in the primary visual
area, but if we

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.699 align:middle line:84%
start to go up in
terms of the processing

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:26.280 align:middle line:84%
when we get to a secondary
level of processing,

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.739 align:middle line:84%
we're beginning to
coalesce forms and shapes.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:32.699 align:middle line:84%
We may be somewhat conscious
of this state, which is maybe

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:35.820 align:middle line:84%
associated with something called
blind sight where people don't

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.800 align:middle line:84%
have that highest level
of processing where

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.590 align:middle line:84%
we see the vivid world
because consciously they

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.360 align:middle line:90%
say I can't see.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask them to guess
what they're looking at

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:48.360 align:middle line:84%
or to navigate through a
room with objects in it,

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.460 align:middle line:84%
they can usually do
so reasonably well as

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.870 align:middle line:90%
if they can see.

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.889 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on we
don't know for sure,

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.597 align:middle line:84%
but it seems that
there's a disconnection

00:34:55.597 --> 00:34:57.060 align:middle line:90%
between the secondary and this--

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.350 align:middle line:90%
the final level of processing.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So we have some
degree of awareness,

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.570 align:middle line:84%
but it's still not really
that clear vivid rendition

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:04.620 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
happen until we get up

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:09.090 align:middle line:84%
to the final stages of
our processing, which

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.560 align:middle line:84%
is in what's called the
visual association area.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And when we see
that, this is where

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.450 align:middle line:84%
we would see this very
vivid picture of what

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:16.590 align:middle line:90%
the world is about.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:90%
We see all the colors.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:21.360 align:middle line:84%
We see everything as if we can
perceive it to be very real.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And not only do we have this
very real perception of it,

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.940 align:middle line:84%
but again these association
areas as they're

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.790 align:middle line:84%
called because they associate
different pieces of information

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:33.910 align:middle line:84%
across the brain, connect this
picture with memory banks,

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and if this is a
picture of a dog,

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:39.240 align:middle line:84%
it makes-- we
identify it as a dog.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.970 align:middle line:84%
We may have an emotional
response to it.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.460 align:middle line:84%
If we love dogs, then we
have a warm fuzzy feeling.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't
like dogs, then we

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.570 align:middle line:84%
may not like this
kind of a picture.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.720 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on what
you're actually--

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.700 align:middle line:84%
what your experiences have
been and how you ultimately

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.730 align:middle line:84%
process the information
that really does create

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:90%
for you your visual world.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So the brain itself
is really what

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.497 align:middle line:90%
is doing all of your sensing.

00:36:02.497 --> 00:36:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, the thing
that I've always

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.960 align:middle line:84%
been fascinated about on
just a very simplistic level

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.910 align:middle line:84%
is that when you stub
your toe walking--

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.887 align:middle line:84%
when you bang into
something, your toe hurts.

00:36:11.887 --> 00:36:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
hurting in your brain,

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's your brain that
actually perceives the hurt.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.670 align:middle line:84%
But you feel it all the
way down in your toe.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:20.446 align:middle line:84%
>> The experiment with
the upside down glasses.

00:36:20.446 --> 00:36:23.680 align:middle line:84%
This man Slater
built these glasses

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.170 align:middle line:84%
made of prisms and lenses
so that you saw things

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:26.970 align:middle line:90%
upside down.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:31.020 align:middle line:90%


00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And he had a group of
people wear these glasses,

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and he asked them to
sustain wearing them.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.220 align:middle line:84%
It was very
uncomfortable for them

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:41.660 align:middle line:84%
because they saw people
walking upside down.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.930 align:middle line:84%
But if they kept the glasses on,
then after two to three weeks,

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.360 align:middle line:84%
depending upon the individual,
that with the glasses

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.770 align:middle line:90%
on-- flip--

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:50.540 align:middle line:84%
they saw everything
right side up.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And if they took the
glasses off at that point--

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:55.980 align:middle line:84%
flip-- they'd see
things upside down.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So what happens,
the way I interpret

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:84%
that is that the mindset was
so strong that people walk

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.370 align:middle line:84%
right side up, that
with the glasses on,

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:12.140 align:middle line:84%
that mindset created a force
to cause the neural dendrites

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.920 align:middle line:84%
to grow in such a way as
to create an inversion

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.470 align:middle line:90%
mirror in the brain.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And then once that hard
wired structure was built

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and you take the
glasses off, now it

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:31.620 align:middle line:84%
has to dissolve that structure
in order to see things the way

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.257 align:middle line:90%
you expect to see them.

00:37:34.257 --> 00:37:35.590 align:middle line:90%
It's called neural learning now.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.990 align:middle line:90%
We do it all the time.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the way it goes.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:43.350 align:middle line:84%
The dilemma is people don't
manifest a lot of these things

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:44.970 align:middle line:90%
because their mindset.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:84%
The mindset of our world says
that we can't do those things.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Those things aren't real.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:55.000 align:middle line:90%
