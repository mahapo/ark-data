Now sometimes, because my mind
is examining all the things

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.130 align:middle line:84%

it takes me a little bit

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.765 align:middle line:90%

And the more I do
that, the more I

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:84%
build a neural net in my brain
that I accept that that's

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:84%
possible, gives me the
power and the incentive

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:90%

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the Super
Bowl this afternoon.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And the reality that
the Eagles are holding

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:84%
is a different reality than
what the Patriots are holding.

going to be the real reality.

So there's some
additive and there

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:90%
are interference patterns.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:90%

What happens?

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:90%
What goes on there?

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing to
realize is that the idea

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:84%
that you create
your own reality--

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.440 align:middle line:84%
if by you, you mean that
egoic person that you think

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:90%
it's probably wrong.

creating the reality

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:10%
non-ordinary state of being,
where the subject objects

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:10%
pretend to disappear.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The samadhi or satori that
I was telling you about.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And it is from this non-ordinary
state that I choose.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the ordinary
exaltation of the new wager

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:84%
also disappeared
until it was forced

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
to face the reality that there
is really, no free lunch.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
We have to meditate and
reach this non-ordinary state

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:84%
subconsciousness
before we become

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:90%
the creator of our own reality.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.160 align:middle line:90%
That took a while.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:84%
But now, I think finally,
people are recognizing

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:90%
that there is no shortcut.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%

that long, either.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not that hard.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not that hard.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
We have been engaging
in creativity

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.480 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:84%
We have created a great amount
of art and music, even science.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Great amount of it.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So there are many people
who are experienced

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
with creative process
that eventually leads

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:84%
to this discontinuous leap
towards this non-ordinary state

How does science disperse
this good news to everyone

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and yet, maintain the ethics of
being scientifically absolute

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.990 align:middle line:84%

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.468 align:middle line:84%
So that when we
look in the mirror,

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
we recognize that it's
ourselves that we're

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.980 align:middle line:84%

going on at the bottom of it.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Let it suffice to say this,
I'm putting myself back

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:90%
on the border, again.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.030 align:middle line:84%
The phenomenon of
consciousness seems, to me,

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.390 align:middle line:84%
one of the points at
which the collision

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:84%
between the
scientistic worldview

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and various
anti-scientistic worldviews

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.830 align:middle line:90%
are going to be the most acute.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's exactly for
this reason that I

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
think it's an enormously
important phenomenon

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.070 align:middle line:90%
to think about.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>> What is consciousness?

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I define consciousness
according to Penrose's view.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a particular
type of self-collapse

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.670 align:middle line:90%
of the wave function.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you know, things
can be in superposition

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:84%
of multiple possible
states or location.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
That's quantum superposition,
and that's the natural state

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.450 align:middle line:90%
in the quantum world.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't see that
in our classical world.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, one explanation is
that conscious observation

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:90%
causes collapse.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the Copenhagen
interpretation.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Another is that
every superposition

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
branches off and
forms a new universe--

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:90%
the multiple-worlds hypothesis.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Another is that interaction
of superposition

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:84%
with the environment
causes decoherence.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth possibility
is that superpositions

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:84%
grow until they meet some
kind of natural threshold

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:84%
inherent in nature, which
causes them to convert

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.340 align:middle line:84%
from the quantum-superposition
state to the classical state.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.020 align:middle line:84%
There are several types
of these theories, which

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:84%
are called objective reduction,
an objective threshold

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.220 align:middle line:90%
for quantum-state reduction.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
One is, if this system
grows too large,

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that's the
Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber, GRW,

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.623 align:middle line:84%
Another is Roger
Penrose's idea that--

00:10:20.623 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
well, first, he starts
with the question, what

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
is superposition,
and he says it's

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:84%
a separation in fundamental
reality at the most

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.370 align:middle line:90%
basic level.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So much like the
multiple-worlds view,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
the separate-- the universe
separates and begins

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to separate but that these
separations are bubbles,

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:84%
if you will, in reality
at the most basic level

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.200 align:middle line:84%
are unstable and,
after a while, will

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:84%
collapse to one or the other
and that this type of collapse,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.450 align:middle line:84%
this type of objective
reduction that

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:84%
occurs due to this
instability in the separation

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
is consciousness.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And it can only happen in
very special circumstances,

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.910 align:middle line:84%
because you need a system that's
isolated from the environment.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't-- it
has to be protected,

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't decohere, and it
has to be large enough to reach

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:90%
this threshold.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:90%
The threshold is given by--

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:84%
it's inversely related to the
size of the superposition.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So something very small like
an electron superposition,

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.518 align:middle line:84%
if protected from decoherence,
would take 10 million years

00:11:17.518 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:84%
to reach threshold,
and then it would

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:84%
have a very dull, tiny
moment of consciousness.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Something very large will
reach threshold quickly,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and in the brain, we think
that quantum computations

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
occur which reach threshold
roughly at 25 milliseconds.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So 40 times a second, we
have conscious moments--

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:84%
collapses, these
self-collapses in which

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
the superpositions collapse
to the classical world.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's a process
occurring at the most basic

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.390 align:middle line:84%
fundamental level of the
universe, at the Planck scale

basically, connected to the

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.520 align:middle line:84%
My parents had no belief, and
I grew up without any beliefs

at all.

00:15:51.642 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%

where did they tell you your
father went when he died?

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, they told
me he went to heaven.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I said, that sounds suspiciously
like a religious view to me.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And I went down
through the list,

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:84%
20 things or so-- you know,
belief in right or wrong,

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:84%
retribution for good and
bad deeds, et cetera--

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and on every single
one of them, he

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:22.170 align:middle line:84%
passed with flying colors as
a person with a profoundly

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:90%

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Religion is simply the study
of God, the mystery of God,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and then endeavoring to
take from scraps of people

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:84%
all about interpretation
and put it--

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:84%

ourselves up, and if we do this,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.120 align:middle line:84%
this is what God
is pleased about.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:84%
But you know,
that's just hogwash.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:10.859 align:middle line:84%
And, so, pleasing God gets
us off of the hook of living.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the very
fact that we had

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.950 align:middle line:84%
to have somebody die for our
sins is sort of a rip-off,

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:90%
don't you think?

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
we already really

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:84%
should have had the privilege
of living out our own sins,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and by virtue of
experience, be enriched

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:90%

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:84%

and all those things,

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.460 align:middle line:84%

achieved the wisdom that allows

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:90%
us to understand everybody.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think now our current
understanding of quantum

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.230 align:middle line:84%
physics is this understanding
of complete unity

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and so that we have to
derive our spirituality

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:90%
from a sense of unity.

way it ought to be.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, the single

in the field of human
endeavor has been religion,

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.860 align:middle line:84%

Frontal lobe.

>> So it begs the question,
what is free will?

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.680 align:middle line:84%
We really think that we have
free will when we make choices,

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.978 align:middle line:84%
but there was an experiment
done with people who

00:26:27.978 --> 00:26:29.270 align:middle line:90%
had damage to the frontal lobe.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.978 align:middle line:84%
The frontal lobe is
the area of the brain

00:26:30.978 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:84%
that we use to really
make free-will choices.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And these people all
had damage or strokes

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.930 align:middle line:84%
to their frontal lobe, and
they put them in a situation

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.640 align:middle line:84%
where they said, this
is a test, and there

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.330 align:middle line:84%
is no right or wrong
answer, but you

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.010 align:middle line:90%
can choose whatever you want.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, all the people who had
damage to the frontal lobe

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:90%
could not choose.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.920 align:middle line:84%
They could not choose
one answer or the other.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.530 align:middle line:90%
They could not make a choice.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.530 align:middle line:84%
When they repeated the
experiment and they said,

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.090 align:middle line:84%
now there's a right
or wrong answer,

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:84%
the moment they said there's
a right or wrong answer,

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.580 align:middle line:84%
these people were
able to choose.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So it has to cause us to
begin to question if we ever

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.100 align:middle line:84%
really choose based on
free will, or are we

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:84%
just choosing what
we already know?

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And that free will
means that we stop

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:23.690 align:middle line:84%
enough to be able to
separate all the knowns

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and speculate possibilities
and potentials that

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:90%
exist in the unknown.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.520 align:middle line:84%
When we live by those automatic
circuits that are already

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:84%
wired known patterns
of association,

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:84%
we're really not making
any free-will choices.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:40.160 align:middle line:84%
We're choosing based
on what we know,

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and as long as we choose
based on what we know,

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.812 align:middle line:90%
we'll always get what we know.

00:27:45.812 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:10%
>> So at the level of the brain,
you've got lots of neurons

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:49.770 align:middle line:10%
interacting locally.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.730 align:middle line:84%
They produce a
global intelligence

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:53.780 align:middle line:84%
that's associated with
the brain as a whole.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But then when you look
at individual neurons,

00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:01.960 align:middle line:84%
the interior of the neurons
is a different physical

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:84%
implementation of
the same principle.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, at every
scale as you go down,

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.860 align:middle line:84%
like Chinese boxes nested
the one in the other,

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:84%
each individual processing
element at one scale

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:84%
can be shown to be composed of
innumerable smaller processing

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.020 align:middle line:90%
elements within it.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And, ultimately, at
the lowest level,

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.370 align:middle line:84%
the analogy is not
going to be obvious,

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.670 align:middle line:84%
but, mathematically,
it's rigorous.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:84%
At the lowest level, the
process whereby proteins fold

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.200 align:middle line:84%
obeys essentially the same
mathematical self-organizing

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.700 align:middle line:84%
dynamic as how a neural
network processes information.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So the folding of a
protein is mathematically

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.550 align:middle line:84%
identical to the generation
of a thought, if you will,

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:84%
or the solving of a problem,
except that when you get down

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.330 align:middle line:84%
to that level, the
process whereby

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:84%
the so-called
neighbor-to-neighbor

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.670 align:middle line:84%
interactions take
place is subtly

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:10.630 align:middle line:84%
different in incorporating
quantum effects.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where the
notion of the quantum brain

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:19.890 align:middle line:84%
comes in, not that the
brain as a whole entity

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:84%
is a quantum entity, but
rather that quantum effects

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:31.770 align:middle line:84%
at the lowest level are not only
capable of but, of necessity,

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:36.270 align:middle line:84%
are amplified upwards because
of this nested Chinese-box

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:37.740 align:middle line:84%
arrangement of the
nervous system.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Consciousness enters this
physiology and animates this

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.680 align:middle line:84%
physiology by essentially
bubbling up through each

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.150 align:middle line:84%
individual cell and through
the DNA within each cell.

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.520 align:middle line:84%
The DNA is a
quantum-mechanical entity,

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.020 align:middle line:90%
but it's a macromolecule.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:84%
It's got one foot in the
macroscopic classical world

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and the other foot deep in
the quantum-mechanical world.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the bridge, if you wish,
between quantum mechanics

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.210 align:middle line:90%
and matter.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But having one foot in
quantum mechanics, which

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.120 align:middle line:84%
is the world of
thought, it basically

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.750 align:middle line:84%
transduces those impulses
of thought into chemicals

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and into the chemistry,
biochemistry, electrophysiology

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.500 align:middle line:90%
of thought.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Jeff's approach is that
quantum randomness influences

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:84%
neurons at the level
of microtubules,

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and I would say that
it's more than that.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:29.640 align:middle line:10%
I would say that quantum effects
act in concert coherently,

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.170 align:middle line:10%
more globally in
the brain, that we

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:32.980 align:middle line:10%
may have macroscopic
quantum states

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.560 align:middle line:10%
throughout large reasons--

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.780 align:middle line:10%
large regions, if
not the whole brain,

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.960 align:middle line:10%
that are basically
identified with

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.075 align:middle line:10%
or influence consciousness.

00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:44.700 align:middle line:84%
You go down a level
of neural networks,

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.550 align:middle line:84%
then to neurons, and inside the
neurons to the microtubules,

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:84%
which are acting as
quantum computers,

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:84%
and then you look at the
individual components

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.110 align:middle line:84%
of the microtubule,
which is a protein which

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.490 align:middle line:90%
changes its shape like that.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So on, off, yes, no,
one or zero, however you

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.450 align:middle line:84%
want to make a computer
analogy, and that

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.940 align:middle line:84%
is the bit-- the fundamental
bit inside neurons,

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:84%
inside cells that
controls what's going on.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, that in turn
is controlled by--

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.360 align:middle line:84%
there are little pockets inside
the proteins in which electrons

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.390 align:middle line:90%
are free to roam.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.860 align:middle line:84%
They're non-polar, so
they're able to roam,

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and if they're in one
position, say an electron here

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.270 align:middle line:90%
and here, the proteins open.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.890 align:middle line:84%
If it's here and
here, it's closed.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So the movements of these
individual electrons,

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.700 align:middle line:84%
which are governed by what are
called van der Waals forces,

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.520 align:middle line:84%
control the state of the
protein, which in turn computes

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.310 align:middle line:84%
in the microtubule, which in
turn controls the neuron, which

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:41.730 align:middle line:84%
in turn leads to the brain
functioning as a whole.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, the electron movement
of these van der Waals forces

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.280 align:middle line:84%
are also related to
the quantum field

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and the zero-point energies
in the quantum vacuum.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Through the workings
of the nervous system

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and the particular way that it
implements quantum effects--

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.840 align:middle line:84%
very distinct specific way,
not general, not fuzzy,

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.580 align:middle line:90%
not imprecise--

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:08.050 align:middle line:84%
that it absolutely does
open the door for free will

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.570 align:middle line:84%
being a possibility
that does not

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:84%
violate modern scientific
tenets and that's

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:18.400 align:middle line:84%
consistent to a certain
extent with people's

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.160 align:middle line:84%
subjective impression
that we do have free will.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> What separates us from all
other species is the ratio

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.090 align:middle line:84%
of our frontal lobe to
the rest of the brain.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.610 align:middle line:84%
The frontal lobe is an area of
the brain that's responsible

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:34.210 align:middle line:84%
for firm intention, for
decision-making, for regulating

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.490 align:middle line:90%
behavior, for inspiration.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It is the seat of what
causes us to take information

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:44.380 align:middle line:84%
from our environment and process
it and store it in our brain

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.777 align:middle line:84%
to make decisions
or choices that

00:32:46.777 --> 00:32:48.610 align:middle line:84%
are different than the
decisions and choices

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:49.777 align:middle line:90%
that we've made in the past.

00:32:49.777 --> 00:32:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Free will resides
in our frontal cortex,

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and we can train
ourself to have--

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to make more-intelligent
choices and to be

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.220 align:middle line:84%
conscious of the
choices we're making.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people use very little
bit of their frontal lobe,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:08.890 align:middle line:84%
so most people already
have a lobotomy,

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and most people don't
really pay attention.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.180 align:middle line:90%
So everybody has ADD.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And the result of it
is that it's easier

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:19.270 align:middle line:84%
to use the already-wired
circuits and the stimulus

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and chemistry that's
involved with using

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:24.130 align:middle line:84%
those automatic circuits
than to stop those circuits

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and begin to look at
possibilities and potentials.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.935 align:middle line:84%
So the point is that, when we're
using those automatic programs

00:33:30.935 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:84%
that are already
wired, they take place

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.260 align:middle line:84%
in the rest of the brain,
and the frontal lobe

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.950 align:middle line:90%
gets to go to sleep.

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So even though we think we
have the free will to choose,

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.100 align:middle line:90%
we don't really have free will.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.908 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is choosing
what we already know.

00:33:44.908 --> 00:33:47.540 align:middle line:90%

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The brain is made up of tiny
nerve cells called neurons.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.880 align:middle line:84%
These neurons have
tiny branches that

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.540 align:middle line:84%
reach out and connect to other
neurons to form a neural net.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Each place where they
connect is integrated

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.880 align:middle line:90%
into a thought or a memory.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>> A neural net basically has to
do with a group of neurons that

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.030 align:middle line:84%
are functioning together
that have a particular type

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.320 align:middle line:90%
of function.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.239 align:middle line:84%
People have looked
at these in terms

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:14.120 align:middle line:84%
of what have been called
cognitive modules, so

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.790 align:middle line:84%
that there may be neural
nets, a group of nerve

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:18.920 align:middle line:84%
cells in either
the same structure

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.310 align:middle line:84%
or across the brain, that
have certain functions that

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:25.560 align:middle line:84%
allow us to process information
in a particular way.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the brain builds up
all its concepts by the law

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:90%
of associate of memory.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:84%
For example, ideas,
thoughts, and feelings

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.909 align:middle line:84%
are all constructed
and interconnected

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:37.940 align:middle line:84%
in this neural net, and all
have a possible relationship

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.230 align:middle line:90%
with one another.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.730 align:middle line:84%
The concept and the
feeling of love,

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:43.980 align:middle line:84%
for instance, is stored
in this vast neural net,

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.580 align:middle line:84%
but we build the concept of love
for many other different ideas.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Some people have love
connected to disappointment.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.460 align:middle line:84%
When they think about
love, they experience

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.620 align:middle line:84%
the memory of pain, sorrow,
anger, and even rage.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Rage may be linked
to hurt, which

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.230 align:middle line:84%
may be linked to a
specific person, which

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:03.690 align:middle line:90%
then is connected back to love.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Every observation can
be looked upon as a quantum

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:06.830 align:middle line:90%
measurement.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:10.050 align:middle line:84%
This quantum measurement
produces memory.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:14.670 align:middle line:84%
We always perceive
something after reflection

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.040 align:middle line:90%
in the meter of memory.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.590 align:middle line:84%
It is this reflection
in the meter of memory

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:24.300 align:middle line:84%
that gives us that sense
of I-ness, who I am.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The brain does not know the
difference between what it sees

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.210 align:middle line:84%
in its environment
and what it remembers,

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:35.130 align:middle line:84%
because the same specific
neural nets are then firing.

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:38.310 align:middle line:84%
We know, physiologically, that
nerve cells that fire together

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.330 align:middle line:90%
wire together.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.250 align:middle line:84%
If you practice something
over and over again,

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.860 align:middle line:84%
those nerve cells have a
long-term relationship.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.000 align:middle line:84%
If you get angry
on a daily basis,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.390 align:middle line:84%
if you get frustrated
on a daily basis,

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.500 align:middle line:84%
if you suffer on a daily
basis, if you give reasons

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.070 align:middle line:84%
for the victimization
in your life,

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.270 align:middle line:84%
you're rewiring
and reintegrating

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:84%
that neural net
on a daily basis,

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and that neural net now has
a long-term relationship

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.490 align:middle line:84%
with all those other nerve
cells called an identity.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.640 align:middle line:84%
We also know that nerve cells
that don't fire together

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.440 align:middle line:90%
no longer wire together.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.080 align:middle line:84%
They lose their
long-term relationship,

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:84%
because every time we interrupt
the thought process that

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.350 align:middle line:84%
produces a chemical
response in the body--

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:22.290 align:middle line:84%
every time we interrupt
it, those nerve cells

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.630 align:middle line:84%
that are connected to
each other start breaking

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.450 align:middle line:90%
the long-term relationship.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> If we practice our mental
rehearsal and our skill

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.220 align:middle line:84%
in being able to do it,
we'll show that certain brain

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.560 align:middle line:84%
circuits will grow as
a result of our effort.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.870 align:middle line:84%
We'll get-- it'll get easier
to do, in other words.

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:44.040 align:middle line:84%
If we accept that
idea, then it will

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.390 align:middle line:84%
allow us to go back the next day
and do it with more certainty

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:51.240 align:middle line:90%
and with more acceptance.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.890 align:middle line:84%
That in itself is no
different than praying.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.070 align:middle line:84%
You see, there is no
religious text that

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:90%
says thought doesn't matter.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.540 align:middle line:84%
There's no religious
text that doesn't say,

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:08.280 align:middle line:84%
your prayer and your intention
shouldn't be answered by God.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But explaining how
that happens is

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.390 align:middle line:84%
what quantum physics and
the observer is all about.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But, still, when
we can make thought

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.090 align:middle line:84%
more real than anything
else, our brain

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.515 align:middle line:90%
is designed to do that.

00:37:22.515 --> 00:37:26.040 align:middle line:84%
The frontal lobe with
its enormous space

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.830 align:middle line:84%
is the alter in which
we place the thought,

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and it gives us the
permission to hold the thought

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.390 align:middle line:84%
for an extended period of
time, and it lowers the volume

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:37.890 align:middle line:90%
to the external stimuli.

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:40.240 align:middle line:90%
We lose track of time and space.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.860 align:middle line:84%
That's the moment we're
stepping into the quantum field.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.350 align:middle line:84%
That's the moment that
now we're making thought

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:90%
more real than anything else.
