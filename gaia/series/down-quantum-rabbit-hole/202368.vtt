00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:40.754 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING)

00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:55.600 align:middle line:84%
When your road deserts you
and your feet disappear,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:90%
you'll find some orchards.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.419 align:middle line:90%
Wasted one, without appeal.

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:11.842 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:19.177 align:middle line:90%
Where will you go from here?

00:01:19.177 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Our mind literally
creates our body.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>> But it all
starts in the cell.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And who gives the
cells the order?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:84%
The orders come from the
neural net in our brains,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:84%
which are based on the
experiences and information

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:90%
that we've lodged in there.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.210 align:middle line:84%
When we use a certain box
of solutions to our life,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that causes chemistry
to take place.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So in order for us to
change the chemistry,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
we would literally
have to change

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
the neural net, which means we'd
have to change our identity.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Which means we'd have
to change our attitude

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
or change the way in which we
interact with our environment.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And every time we keep
being the same person

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and keep experiencing the same
attitudes, all we're doing

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.780 align:middle line:84%
is reinforcing ourselves
as our identity.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I once did a little gig in a
woman's prison of-- they're all

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:90%
heroin addicts.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And by teaching them that they
have receptors for the heroin

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and that the more
heroin that they take,

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
their ability to make their
own internal endorphins,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
their own internal heroin
basically starts to decline.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And then their receptors
start to become sub-sensitive

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:84%
or there's actually
less of them.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So there's these
actual changes and then

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:84%
this new information
about how less brain

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:90%
cells are being made.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So that people get, kind
of, in all addictions,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.100 align:middle line:90%
they get stuck in old patterns.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The person's mental life
becomes dominated by pain.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Such that everything
that they perceive

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:90%
is colored by the pain.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, every
way that they react

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and everything that they do
becomes all about their pain.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things about
receptors is they change

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:90%
in their sensitivity.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.410 align:middle line:84%
If a given receptor for a
given drug or internal juice

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:84%
is being bombarded for a long
time at a high intensity,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:90%
it will literally shrink up.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
There will be less of them or it
will be cooked up in such a way

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:84%
that it is desensitized
or down regulating.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So the same amount of
drug or internal juice

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.585 align:middle line:84%
will elicit a much
smaller response.

00:03:43.585 --> 00:03:50.874 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.874 --> 00:03:53.354 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:53.354 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>> If we're bombarding the
cell with the same attitude

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and the same chemistry over and
over again on a daily basis,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:84%
when that cell finally
decides to divide,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle line:84%
when it produces a sister
cell or a daughter cell,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:84%
that next cell will have
more receptor sites for those

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.090 align:middle line:84%
particular emotional neural
peptides and less receptor

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:84%
sites for vitamins, minerals,
nutrients, fluid exchange,

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
or even the release of
waste products or toxins.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, all aging is a result of
improper protein production.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:90%
What happens when we age?

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Our skin loses elasticity.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, elastin is a protein.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our enzymes?

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:90%
We don't digest as well.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
What happens to
our synovial fluid?

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.957 align:middle line:84%
Those are proteins that
become brittle and stiff.

00:05:14.957 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our bones?

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.500 align:middle line:90%
They become thin.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.318 align:middle line:84%
So all aging is a result of
improper protein production.

00:05:22.318 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So then the question
arises, does it really

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:90%
matter what we eat?

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And does nutrition
really have an effect

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
if the cell doesn't
even have the receptor

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
sites after 20 years
of emotional abuse

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
to even receive or let
in the nutrients that

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:90%
are necessary for its health.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So if the muscle cells
making healthy muscle protein

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and over years and years of
producing the same attitude

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:84%
chemically, that cell starts
to produce the normal muscle

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
protein, but now in the sequence
is the amino acid sequence

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:90%
of sadness.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:90%
That's not the same protein.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Because we know scientifically,
that if we alter the amino acid

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:84%
sequence, we've
changed the protein.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So we have normal muscle
protein with the signal

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
of the attitude mixed in
with that particular protein.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's a cheaper
grade of protein.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a weaker protein.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at the
human body when it ages,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
it ages because the proteins
that we've produced once

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
when we were 16 or
17 years old are now

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.520 align:middle line:84%
a cheaper grade of protein than
when we're 50 or 60 years old.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And who gives the orders for
the signaling from the brain

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the receptor site
is our own personal attitude.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Now they'll tell you if you
read any scientific texts

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:90%
that genetics causes diseases.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Genetics cause disease.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And then recently, science
now says, well, no.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not genetics
that causes disease.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the environment that
stimulates the genetics that

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:90%
caused disease.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying is it's
our reaction to the environment

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.380 align:middle line:84%
that stimulates the affects of
genetics that causes disease

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we change
our attitude, that

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.135 align:middle line:84%
means we're going to change
the effects neuro chemically,

00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
which means we're
going to change

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.225 align:middle line:90%
our effects biologically.

00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Which means we're
going to change

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:84%
the effects of the
receptor site, which

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
means we're going to change
the expression of DNA.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Which means we're going
to change the expression

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:84%
protein, which means
we're going to change

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:84%
the expression of
life, which means

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.200 align:middle line:84%
we're going to change the
health of the physical body.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So our attitude literally has
an effect on a cellular level.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a great
experiment done--

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Stanford University,
I believe-- where

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:84%
people were given the task
of eating something decadent.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I think, it was a
piece of chocolate cake

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps, they chose what
the decadent thing was.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And the people who did it with
a sense of guilt and shame

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:84%
actually experienced a transient
decrease in immune function.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, those who were able
to just enjoy the experience

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and savor this wonderful
whatever that they

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:84%
put in their mouths, actually
had a surge in immune status.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Capacity is in our
bodies to be coherent.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And thus, manifest higher and
higher energy density levels

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.829 align:middle line:90%
and to be big time creators.

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:90%
Just up to us.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:84%
We have the free will to
not do it or to do it.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And then it just takes
time and practice.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Just pumping iron.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible to
have mind over matter?

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Baby, the brain is king.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.930 align:middle line:90%
The body is the kingdom.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:84%
How long will that
take to happen?

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Long enough for it to be the
mainstay of your personality.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.070 align:middle line:84%
To our very brain, those
great thunderstorms,

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.512 align:middle line:84%
we have tapped yet a
third of its ability.

00:09:28.512 --> 00:09:31.470 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
If we lived entirely, the
wholeness of our brain, which

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:84%
would require the wholeness
of our DNA be activated,

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:48.620 align:middle line:84%
we would become
the legends of old.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:90%
The immortals.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I really believe that the
body wants to heal itself

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and the limits are in our own
minds of what we believe is

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.580 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I think so much more is
possible then we appreciate.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone's DNA, they use
less than a third of their DNA.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that there
are immortal genes?

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that you
have immortal DNAs?

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
you have the DNA

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
to grow any part of
your body, to change it

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.910 align:middle line:90%
any way you want to?

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Did you know, you have

A sudden new concept
creating an ah-ha

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:84%
can classically translate
to nerve impulses

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
in the hypothalamus,
which then cause

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:84%
various different
peptides to be released

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.840 align:middle line:84%
from the pituitary gland,
which then circulate

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:84%
through the bloodstream
and have the potential

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:84%
to reach every cell in the body
where, by acting on receptors,

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.200 align:middle line:90%
they can effect change.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's a classical view.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's another
view that can happen.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Not instead of,
but in addition to.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:49.230 align:middle line:84%

which, for lack
of a better word,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:84%
we can call them cells
of the immune system.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:84%
But we're not sure how many
of these are stem cells.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're constantly
passing through.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time we have
this sudden realization,

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:84%
we may imprint an
act and set off

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:84%
a cascade of molecular changes
in these surveillance cells.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the
surveillance cell may

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:84%
set up residence in
the brain and continue

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.900 align:middle line:90%

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.820 align:middle line:84%

changes the thought process.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.672 align:middle line:84%
in certain fundamental
virtues like self-discipline.

00:21:04.672 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
up in the morning,

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
you have to make an intelligent
decision about how you're

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.482 align:middle line:90%
going to spend your time.

00:21:09.482 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>> People who make up
their mind about anything--

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:84%
whether they're given a
prognosis of terminal cancer,

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
whether they're given a
prognosis of a certain health

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:84%
malady that's going to take
a certain amount of time--

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:84%
the person who makes
up their mind--

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and that is a great definition
of the frontal lobe--

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:84%
when you make up your
mind about something,

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.240 align:middle line:90%
you're overcoming the body.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:84%
You're overcoming
the enforcement

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.030 align:middle line:90%
from the environment.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.275 align:middle line:90%
And you're overcoming time.

00:21:41.275 --> 00:21:44.067 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.067 --> 00:21:45.817 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, poopy.

00:21:45.817 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> If you don't see the traps,
you have to go through the crap

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:90%
until you see the traps.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
see it, it's you're

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:90%
only teaching machine.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.240 align:middle line:84%
It's your only way
for you to come

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.530 align:middle line:90%
to understand something new.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So the universe brings
these things to your door.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And there is learning
in them for you,

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
if you are willing
to reflect upon them

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.333 align:middle line:84%
and think beyond
the rigid mindset.

00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:25.005 align:middle line:90%
- Can I-- wow--

00:22:25.005 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.275 align:middle line:90%
borrow some toothpaste?

00:22:29.275 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> When I talk about
we disappearing,

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean that we
physically disappear.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
What I mean is that we move out
of the area of the brain that

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:90%
has to do with our personality.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:84%
That has to do with
our association

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.940 align:middle line:84%
to people, our
association that places,

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.900 align:middle line:84%
our association to things
and times and events.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:84%
We don't exist in the
associative centers

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
in our brain that
reaffirms our identity

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:90%
and reaffirms our personality.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We now have science to back
up what our thoughts do and how

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:90%
they make our bodies weak.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of scientists who
are actually studying this

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:84%
with behavioral
kinesiology and other ways,

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:84%
showing that thoughts
make your body weak.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.093 align:middle line:84%
And thoughts, pretty
much, create your reality.

00:23:31.093 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:84%
They create what you're
going to-- what you're

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:90%
going to think about yourself.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.910 align:middle line:84%
If you're fat, but you
think you're wonderful,

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:90%
you'll be wonderful.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:90%
But most women are--

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.970 align:middle line:84%
we're compared all the time
with impossible images,

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:90%
from Barbie to models.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we think that our
whole currency is how we look

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and how other people are
going to perceive us.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're always up against
impossible standards.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> What is relative to their own
emotional addiction are movies

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and dramas and news
and all the media.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
They're just so beautiful
today in providing people

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:84%
with experiences without
having to be there.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:13.420 align:middle line:90%
And yet-- and yet--

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
that distance does not
define human greatness.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>> They're so hypnotized by
their environment through

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:27.010 align:middle line:84%
the media, through television,
through people living

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and creating ideals that
everybody struggles to become,

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:84%
that no one can actually become
in terms of physical appearance

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and definitions of beauty and
valor, that are all illusions.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:84%
That most people surrender and
live their life in mediocrity.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And they may live
that life and the soul

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:84%
may never really-- their
desire may never really

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.610 align:middle line:84%
rise to the surface so they
may want to be something else.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But if it does
rise to the surface

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and they ask themselves,
if there is something more

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:90%
or why am I here?

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:90%
What is the purpose of life?

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Where am I going?

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.335 align:middle line:90%
What happens when I die?

00:25:08.335 --> 00:25:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And they start to
ask those questions,

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:84%
they start to flirt and
interact with the perception

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that they may be having
a nervous breakdown.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And, in reality,
what they're doing

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.700 align:middle line:84%
is that their old
concepts of how

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.355 align:middle line:84%
they viewed their life and
the world start to fall apart.

00:25:25.355 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:90%

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why very few
people make this journey.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Because it's deeply unsettling.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:84%
All of the molds that we have
lived by have to be broken.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And we have to liberate
ourselves in this way.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, there's
an awkward period

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:84%
between the comfort
that we knew before

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and the real state
of comfort when

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.560 align:middle line:84%
we are the lord of
our being, which

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:90%
follows that interval of chaos.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Most people, when they
get into the chaos,

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:84%
give up hope and go back to
the old, false securities.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:84%
They get to live
a reasonable life.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And they get to die
in some sort of peace.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't advanced
spiritually at all,

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:84%
in that experiment
that we call the life.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:27:04.532 align:middle line:90%


00:27:04.532 --> 00:27:07.012 align:middle line:90%

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.173 align:middle line:84%
>> We're in completely new
territory in our brain.

00:27:12.173 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And because we're in
completely new territory,

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:90%
we're rewiring the brain.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Literally reconnecting
to a new concept.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Then ultimately, it changes
us from the inside out.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.900 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:84%
If I change my mind,
will I change my choices?

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.070 align:middle line:84%
If I change my choices,
will my life change?

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I change?

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:90%
What am I addicted to?

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.500 align:middle line:84%
What will I lose that I'm
chemically attached to?

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And what person, place,
thing time or event

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:84%
that I'm chemically
attached to that I don't

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
want to lose because I
may have to experience

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:84%
the chemical
withdrawal from that?

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Hence, the human drama.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:55.450 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.450 --> 00:28:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>> This life is but a
page in an enormous book,

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:84%
in which we will
always be who we are.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But always with the inherent
needling of ambitious pursuit.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:19.040 align:middle line:84%
A pursuit that takes us
from the boring tedium

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:84%
of self-reflection of
self-hate and to self-creation

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.800 align:middle line:90%
of new dreams.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.945 align:middle line:90%
And we are ambitious gods.

00:28:29.945 --> 00:28:43.900 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a big paradigm
shift involved in the teachings

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.420 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus, from the teachings
of the Old Testament.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.610 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in the
Sermon on the Mount,

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:84%
he quoted Moses saying,
"an eye for an eye

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and a tooth for a
tooth, but I say to you,

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.000 align:middle line:90%
forgive your enemies.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And do good to
those who hate you."

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.990 align:middle line:84%
In the teachings of Jesus, it
seems that thinking something

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.390 align:middle line:90%
is the same as doing it.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So if I think of
murdering my neighbor,

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:84%
but don't actually do
it, obviously, it's

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:90%
different for the neighbor.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it's not different
in terms of human evolution.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that's borne out

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:84%
by the quantum understanding
of the world which

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:90%
we're familiar with today.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:84%
That it's the heart
that governs all things.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.570 align:middle line:10%
And in the evolution or
the development of my self

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.340 align:middle line:10%
that I am constructing--

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:41.350 align:middle line:10%
so to speak-- internally, the
thought is what's paramount.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So I think in that respect, many
of the teachings and parables

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.490 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus were touching on
something that we know now

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.720 align:middle line:84%
to be eminently profound about
the nature of the reality we

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:90%
live in.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And how the processes
of evolution

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that we want to use for
spiritual development

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.180 align:middle line:90%
actually function.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of what the
new paradigm is,

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.370 align:middle line:84%
is the awareness that
the spiritual is real.

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, mainstream
medicine is the only system

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:14.140 align:middle line:84%
of medicine in the entire
world that does not invoke

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.030 align:middle line:90%
higher power and mystery.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.065 align:middle line:90%
It's the only one.

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the reason that
science hasn't really explored

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.470 align:middle line:90%
these questions is twofold.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.840 align:middle line:84%
One is that there has been a
significant conflict, if you

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.080 align:middle line:84%
will, between spirituality
or religion and science

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.600 align:middle line:90%
over the last century, really.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Where people have
really come to look

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.380 align:middle line:84%
at religion and
spirituality as, kind of,

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:39.310 align:middle line:84%
this falsehood and as delusional
and in a very negative way,

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:90%
from the scientific perspective.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And having nothing to do
with what science can show.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's happened
is that not only have people

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:84%
realized that science
does have something

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:90%
to say about spirituality.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And that we can
utilize science to help

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:55.100 align:middle line:84%
us understand what the spiritual
sides are of human beings.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.240 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is that
as our science gets better,

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:84%
we're able to ask more
interesting and more complex

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.050 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.705 align:middle line:84%
So 15, 20 years ago, we
couldn't ask a question about,

00:31:05.705 --> 00:31:08.080 align:middle line:84%
what goes on in the brain of
somebody when they meditate?

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.997 align:middle line:84%
But now we have the
techniques and the ability

00:31:09.997 --> 00:31:12.050 align:middle line:90%
to explore that kind of issue.

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So, on one hand, science
is developing to the point

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.590 align:middle line:84%
where we are having the ability
to ask these kinds of very

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:20.560 align:middle line:84%
complex questions about these
very unusual experiences

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.860 align:middle line:90%
that people have.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a
realization that there

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:84%
may be more to these experiences
than what we have typically

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:90%
thought of.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And that science
and spirituality

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.530 align:middle line:84%
may actually have something
to say about each other.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>> A very great
spiritual teacher, Jesus,

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:38.410 align:middle line:84%
said in a long time ago,
kingdom of God is everywhere.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:40.390 align:middle line:90%
People don't see it.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:41.650 align:middle line:90%
It is everywhere.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not in our state
of consciousness.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Exists within us.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we
fundamentally are.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Descartes invented dualism
to avoid the problem between

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.950 align:middle line:90%
the church and science.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And ever since, science
and spirituality

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.880 align:middle line:90%
have been on separate paths.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact,
consciousness and science

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.730 align:middle line:84%
were on separate paths
from much of this century

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:06.730 align:middle line:90%
due to the behaviorists.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.855 align:middle line:84%
It's only been the last 20
years that consciousness

00:32:08.855 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:90%
has come back into science.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Can spirituality come
back into science?

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.050 align:middle line:90%
I think it can.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I think only recently
have we got a framework

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:90%
to understand spirituality.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:23.260 align:middle line:84%
For example, this level of
the fundamental spacetime

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:84%
geometry which can
include platonic values

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:31.450 align:middle line:84%
of good, aesthetics, beauty,
pure truth, as well as feeling

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:32.980 align:middle line:90%
emotion.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the fact that
it interconnects

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:84%
all of our conscious entities
or proto-conscious entities

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:84%
with other beings and
with the universe itself.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:44.295 align:middle line:84%
This interconnectedness,
this timelessness, I think,

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:46.920 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning of a scientific
understanding of spirituality.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So what the scientists and
what the mystics are talking

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.480 align:middle line:84%
about are not just
parallel realities.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.840 align:middle line:84%
They are really one and
the same investigation.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just that scientists have
been investigating the material

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.740 align:middle line:84%
world and their spiritual
traditions have investigated

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:84%
not only the material, but also
the vital, the mental, and even

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:07.770 align:middle line:90%
the supramental--

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:90%
the domain of love, justice.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.730 align:middle line:84%
These archetypes which Plato
investigated long, long time

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.710 align:middle line:90%
ago, even in the West.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:15.970 align:middle line:90%
So that's the difference.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Now we have extended our
science to not only contain what

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.990 align:middle line:84%
the scientists have
traditionally investigated--

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.170 align:middle line:90%
the materials--

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:28.390 align:middle line:84%
but also a mental, the
vital, and supramental,

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:30.130 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness itself.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>> At a fundamental level that
is even difficult to observe,

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.240 align:middle line:90%
there is one God self.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.750 align:middle line:90%
One God self that is all of us.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.850 align:middle line:90%
We grow from that.

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:44.590 align:middle line:90%
The whole universe grew from it.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And each of the separate
personalities that appeared

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.910 align:middle line:84%
have grown from it, with the
illusion that each one is

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:53.560 align:middle line:90%
a separate individual.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.630 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we're
all from the same tree.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Entanglement is a new
idea because it's arising out

00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.680 align:middle line:90%
of science.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.710 align:middle line:84%
But the concept of
a connected universe

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:05.950 align:middle line:90%
is as ancient as we know.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:84%
Like the fundamental
principles in Eastern

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:12.670 align:middle line:84%
philosophy is that
everything is entangled.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:14.139 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't use those words.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:16.420 align:middle line:84%
But that's basically,
what the models

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.370 align:middle line:90%
are from Eastern philosophy.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So we have that as a historical
basis for these kinds of ideas.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.630 align:middle line:84%
It's called words like
cosmic consciousness

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:27.969 align:middle line:90%
or collective consciousness.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And the new part
is that science,

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.940 align:middle line:84%
through very different
means, has encountered

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:90%
this aspect of the world.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.739 align:middle line:84%
And is now beginning
fairly rapidly, actually,

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.300 align:middle line:90%
to learn the nature of it.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you understand what
we're talking about here?

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.840 align:middle line:84%
In terms of
religion, you cannot.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.600 align:middle line:84%
People often say to me
exactly what you said.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me when I go home,
how my mother or my grandmother

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.770 align:middle line:84%
can link this to
what she believes in?

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.610 align:middle line:84%
It's an entirely
different world view.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think Jesus put it
very well when he said,

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.970 align:middle line:84%
you cannot put new wine
into old wine skins.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do,
the skins will break

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.960 align:middle line:90%
and it will all be lost.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>> We are at the
end of the paradigm.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:16.610 align:middle line:84%
We're at the finite stage
of the sensual paradigm.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:84%
There is no more paradigm
to have in the census.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:23.320 align:middle line:84%
We can modify the paradigm
within the box of what's

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.570 align:middle line:90%
already been created centrally.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But the borders are
at its extension.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a very weird
time right now.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Because East has met West.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
flowering of ideas.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And many of us who were asked
to grow up in one paradigm

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.150 align:middle line:90%
have to switch to a new one.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:47.870 align:middle line:90%
And that is very tricky.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.380 align:middle line:84%
I, for myself,
personally, it's--

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.900 align:middle line:90%
I can experience both paradigms.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I experience a
beautiful blend of both.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I just
get up to the new one,

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.430 align:middle line:90%
fall back to the old.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that maybe we're
the only generation that's

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:08.695 align:middle line:84%
going to have to suffer through
this because this movie's going

00:36:08.695 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:90%
to spell it out for people.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.000 align:middle line:90%
