NARRATOR: A splash of
blue floating in a

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.443 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
sea of cold and darkness.

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.545 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Once, this was the center
of the universe

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and humans were alone.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.249 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now, science is convinced
that others

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.084 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
are out there somewhere.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:54.121 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Giant ears scan the heavens,
searching for a needle in the

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
cosmic haystack.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But is the proof we seek right
here in our backyards?

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Millions of people over
thousands of years say they've

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.398 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
seen metallic disks
in our skies.

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:06.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Thousands more claim
close encounters

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
with strange beings.

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:11.571 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Animals are bloodlessly
harvested by seemingly

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.574 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
invisible forces, and
for unknown reasons.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:18.211 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Intricate agroglyphs appear
mysteriously, the handiwork of

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.748 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
unseen artists, and a solemn
face stares at us from the

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.584 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
surface of Mars, as if watching
for a number of

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:28.155 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
comprehension, a possible sign
that we might finally be ready

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:29.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
for the next step.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Science, the government, and the
press insist there is no

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:37.597 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
evidence of UFOs or
an alien presence.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Yet people all over the planet
seem to sense otherwise.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's as Aldous Huxley once
wrote, facts do not cease to

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
exist merely because
they're ignored.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.642 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In these programs, we intend
to do what scientists and

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:49.977 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
others won't do.

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:52.646 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Look at the evidence,
the best evidence.

00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Well, we just started
making these things,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and this was an opportunity at
this exposition to show them.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:39.359 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We thought it would fit in very
nicely, and we thought

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.894 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it'd fit in with the program.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Science in journalism
may not take UFOs

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.099 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
seriously, but the subject gets
plenty of respect from

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.634 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the world of commerce.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:51.171 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
UFO conventions are held
somewhere almost weekly, from

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:56.143 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Los Angeles to Las Vegas, to
Eureka Springs, Arkansas, all

00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:57.677 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
over the world.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And most come complete with
flying saucer supermarkets,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.681 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
where assortments
of outer space

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.084 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
merchandise are for sale.

00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:05.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: We're going to be-- we
are raffling off this whole

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.721 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
tape set, so if you
fill that out.

00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.189 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
NARRATOR: See, we have
them with the pearls

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and everything else.

00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: T-shirts, hats,
videos, bumper stickers, and

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
board games.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Mother ships bedecked with magic
crystals, glow in the

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.705 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
dark planets, alien masks,
and alien models.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Alien abduction protection
kits.

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:32.746 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
NARRATOR: Creates
a disturbance in

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:34.915 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the magnetic field.

00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:37.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: Alien Christmas cards,
alien head pillows,

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.853 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
alien hand puppets,
and dissected

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:42.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
alien children's toys.

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:44.991 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Bald, bug-eyed aliens are
seemingly everywhere these

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
days, in our movies, and TV
programs, in books and

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
magazines, and comic strips.

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:55.769 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
In advertising.

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.606 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
American Express, don't leave
your planet without it.

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:02.142 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Newspapers sell UFO
fishing lures.

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:05.612 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Las Vegas casinos
offer UFO bingo.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:06.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
More than money is
at work here.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In the face of persistent scorn
and decades of official

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.787 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
ridicule, interest in UFOs
appears to be growing.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:17.357 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Don Ecker is an editor for UFO
Magazine, and also hosts a

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:21.428 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
weekly coast to coast radio
show, UFOs Tonight.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.498 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: In the last 10 years,
once again, there has

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:27.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
been a reemergence of interest
among the American public, and

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:31.771 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
slowly but surely, various media
outlets are taking a

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.541 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
closer look at what, in
fact, is going on.

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:36.676 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
NARRATOR: UFO conventions
aren't held for the sole

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
purpose of selling baubles
or booklets,

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
or space age religion.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.283 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Most are sponsored by serious
minded organizations, like

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.453 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
MUFON, the Mutual UFO
Network, which has

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.688 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
thousands of members worldwide.

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:51.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Convention delegates typically
share new findings, or debate

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.595 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the veracity of UFO cases,
theories, and witnesses.

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:58.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Our group is a
scientific organization, and

00:04:58.198 --> 00:04:59.799 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
we have 75 consultants.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
All have doctorates in their
own fields of expertise.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
There are over 40 of our
consultants here at this

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
symposium, and these are
professional people.

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
Academics.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But you wouldn't know that
from readings or watching

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:13.813 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
media reports.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Many UFO gatherings permit a
wide spectrum of persons to

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:19.786 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
attend, and to sell their
wares or services.

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:21.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Everything from crystals
to aura

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.823 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
photos, to fortune tellers.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:26.826 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Subsequent media coverage of
UFO conferences usually

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.029 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
focuses on the oddball
elements,

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
whatever is most colorful.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And the serious research
gets left on the

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.134 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
editing room floor.

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:37.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: One of the attendees
was a woman who say she's 400

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.739 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
years old, and from
the planet Venus.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:42.642 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Another woman says she was
instructed by her space alien

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:45.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
brothers to undergo breast
implant surgery.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:49.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And a man selling tapes to Earth
vortex sites claims that

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the Tri-lateral Commission has
signed a secret treaty to

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.855 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
enslave the world.

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:58.858 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Sensational claims
made by ubiquitous supermarket

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.828 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
tabloids also make it tough
for ufologists to be taken

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.396 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
seriously by reporters.

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:06.266 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Few mainstream journalists want
their work to be equated

00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:09.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with the occasionally humorous
but overtly ridiculous subject

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.671 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
matter of the tabloids.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:15.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Space alien snatch bowler just
as he completes a 300 game.

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Martians here to steal
our frogs.

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.281 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Girl gives birth to
52 UFO babies.

00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:23.583 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
ET political hobnobbers
meet with all

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.318 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
manner of public figures.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:28.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's no accident that aliens
and UFOs appear so often in

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:29.956 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
the tabloids.

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:32.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The already popular weekly World
News confirms that its

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:37.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
sales jump every time it has,
quote, the alien on its cover.

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:39.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
UFO stories in general
are sure fire stuff.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:43.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
For a reporter trying to read
through the deluge of patently

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
ridiculous material is
a daunting task.

00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:50.143 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's far easier to poke fun at
saucer nights in ET masks, or

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:52.912 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
stories about alien
ice cream junkies.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.982 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Every outrageous fantasy, every
make believe headline

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:58.918 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
plays directly into the hands
of those who don't want the

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
subject taken seriously.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: Journalists apparently
are leery of

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:04.624 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
touching the subject.

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:08.928 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What they have been told for
decades is the truth is

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
there's nothing to it.

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:12.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
There's nothing to the
UFO phenomenon.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:16.936 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Yet the preponderance of
evidence is on the other side.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:22.509 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Anyone who takes about one hour
to review some of the

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:27.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
available evidence cannot come
away without the firm

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:31.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
conviction that there is
something out there.

[music playing]

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:41.461 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: UFOs are seen far more
often than blue moons,

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and by some of the most famous
people of this century.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.865 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
More on that in a moment.

Puerto Rico, 1967.

00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:05.485 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
Brazil, 1978.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.988 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
California, 1990.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:15.995 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The Hawaiian Islands, 1974.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This drawing shows what
witnesses reportedly saw

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.901 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
flying over France in 1952.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.509 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of Brazil in 1958.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Again in Brazil during 1976.

Japan, 1989.

00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:45.458 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This famous photo was snapped
by farmers in Mcminnville,

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.293 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
Oregon, 1950.

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Four years later, a military
pilot in Europe photographed

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
what seems to be its
near double.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:56.736 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This whirling burr like
craft was spotted over

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:59.272 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
California in 1964.

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:01.808 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
25 years later, Russian
witnesses

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:04.744 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
described the same craft.

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.312 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
People all over the
planet have seen

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.782 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
remarkably similar objects.

00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:10.583 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-It was dark, there was three
or four of us running along.

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.051 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
All of the sudden
it was daylight.

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:14.287 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Just bright than all get out,
but you could see over yonder

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:16.055 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that it was dark.

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:20.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-A same bright red color, and it
wasn't blinking or nothing.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
It was just like a
ball of light.

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:27.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-What I saw was these balls of
light traveling from the west

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:29.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to the east, all the
way across the sky.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:32.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-It was just a bright, bright,
bright, light.

00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:33.807 align:middle line:79% position:49% size:13%
Yeah.

00:09:33.807 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And it would dim, and get
brighter, and it would just

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.446 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
stop and hover sometimes.

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
-Did you see that?

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.081 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
You know, everybody's,
did you see that?

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:46.386 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Everybody saw it, but nobody
had an explanation.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:48.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: UFOs don't seem to
know that they don't exist,

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
nor do they seem to care.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.092 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They keep popping up in apparent
defiance of science

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:56.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and the media, which is the main
reason public interest in

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:59.199 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the topic remains high, and why
the public doesn't seem to

00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:01.634 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
buy the official explanations.

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:04.838 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Opinion polls consistently show
that well over half of

00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:09.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
all Americans believe UFOs are
real, possibly alien craft.

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:14.848 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In 1993, a non scientific survey
by USA Today revealed

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:19.118 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that an astounding 91% of its
readers believe Earth has been

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.453 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
visited by extraterrestrials.

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:26.125 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
While there is no central
collection point for all UFO

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:28.795 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
data, much information is
available today through

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
computer hook ups.

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:33.132 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
John Komar runs an international
computer network

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:37.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
for MUFON, and says he's
received 15,000 communications

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:39.239 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in 2 and 1/2 years.

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:41.374 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-Input we get is worldwide.

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:45.211 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Information we get are from
researchers, scientists,

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.146 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
astronomers.

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:51.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Information that would take an
individual years to obtain is

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:52.652 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
at their fingertips.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.988 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Komar, who has worked
for a major airline the

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:58.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
past 26 years, is one of an
estimated 20 million Americans

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.027 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who say they've seen a UFO.

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:04.831 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Contrary to the stereotype of
UFO witnesses as attention

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
seekers or wackos, most
witnesses are considered

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:10.069 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
stable, and are generally
reluctant to

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:11.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
discuss their sightings.

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:14.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Even government studies estimate
only 2% of reported

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:17.877 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
sightings come from people
with mental problems.

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Still, unfounded perceptions
about flying saucer sightings

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
persist, discouraging some of
the best witnesses from

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
telling anyone about
what they've seen.

00:11:27.587 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-Pilots are really reluctant to
discuss any UFO sightings

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.359 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in public, or to go
public with it.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: But they see them?

00:11:34.227 --> 00:11:36.429 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-But they do see them, yes.

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:37.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
Quite a lot.

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:38.865 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
Quite a lot.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:46.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
One researcher estimates about
20,000 cases of pilots seeing

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:48.575 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
UFOs during flights.

00:11:48.575 --> 00:11:53.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-The sighting that we saw was
just right up over the tallest

00:11:53.513 --> 00:11:54.981 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
tree there.

00:11:54.981 --> 00:11:57.116 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NARRATOR: Taylor Blair of
Memphis is one such pilot.

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:59.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
He's been flying since
he was 18 years old.

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:02.455 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Everything from B29s
to small Cessnas.

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:05.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
What he and eight other people
saw zipping around over his

00:12:05.592 --> 00:12:08.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
backyard one night was
unlike anything he

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:09.929 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
had ever seen before.

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:13.533 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-We saw four huge lights that
looked like, about the color

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:17.303 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of railroad flares, and we
estimated that the height was

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:20.673 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
about 6,000 feet.

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:23.876 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
My wife, in the meantime, had
come into the telephone and

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:29.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
called the airport, called the
approach control people, and

00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:31.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
told them what we were saying.

00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:33.252 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And they said, well, they had a
radar fix on something, and

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:35.488 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
they had dispatched
a helicopter,

00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:38.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
police helicopter out.

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:41.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And by the time she came back to
tell us, the helicopter was

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:45.765 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
over the backyard also,
apparently trying to climb,

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:49.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but whatever it was outclimbed
him, and disappeared.

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:51.838 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Subsequent news
articles suggested the object

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:54.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
was a weather balloon, but Blair
and the other witnesses,

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:58.144 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
including other pilots,
disagree, because they say the

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:01.314 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
four lights merged into one,
and then zoomed off at an

00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:02.815 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
incredible speed.

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:05.184 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
That would have been some
weather balloon.

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:07.186 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-You can't estimate a speed or
anything, that it traveled at?

00:13:07.186 --> 00:13:08.354 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
-No, I can't.

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:09.822 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
Pretty fast.

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-Thousands of miles an hour?

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.027 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-Faster than I ever traveled on
an airplane, I'll say that.

00:13:14.027 --> 00:13:16.663 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: In addition to vast
numbers of pilots, thousands

00:13:16.663 --> 00:13:19.298 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of police officers have
seen, chased, or

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
been chased by UFOs.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Veteran police officer Chuck
Woodworth and five others saw

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:28.675 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
a huge, brilliant UFO
in central Nevada.

00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:31.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-And we stopped the car to
look at it because the

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:36.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
movement of this light
was square.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:39.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It wasn't a gradual fall
or gradual rise.

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It went straight up,
straight down, and

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.290 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
it made square corners.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.027 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's a good possibility it is
something from somewhere else.

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Woodworth says he
passed on this information to

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.366 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
military authorities,
but to his knowledge

00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:54.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
nothing was ever done.

00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:58.337 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
This citing put him in some
rarefied company, not only

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:01.107 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with pilots and police
officers, but also a

00:14:01.107 --> 00:14:02.608 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
president or two.

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:05.011 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Jimmy Carter once saw
a UFO, and even

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.346 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
filed a formal statement.

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:10.016 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Ronald Reagan has had
two UFO sightings.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In one case he ordered
his pilot to try

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:14.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and follow the object.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Britain's Prince Charles had a
UFO sighting while flying home

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
from a trip to the US.

00:14:19.926 --> 00:14:23.496 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The prince's countrymen, 2001
author and science writer

00:14:23.496 --> 00:14:27.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Arthur C. Clarke says he has
had six separate UFO

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.935 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
encounters.

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:34.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Boxing great and devout Muslim
Muhammad Ali has seen a UFO.

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:38.377 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Likewise for the king of rock
and roll, Elvis Presley.

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:41.447 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Flamboyant guitarist Jimi
Hendrix claimed that a UFO

00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:43.282 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
saved his life.

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:46.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Actor William Shatner met plenty
of aliens on the Star

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:49.622 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Trek series, but also claims to
have seen what he suspects

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:53.392 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
was an extraterrestrial
aircraft in real life.

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:56.395 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So did Ray Walston, the actor
who played the title role in

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:59.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the TV series, My Favorite
Martian.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The late John Lennon said he
watched a UFO fly over

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:04.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Manhattan in the '70s.

00:15:04.437 --> 00:15:09.075 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Farah Fawcett, Ed Asner, Jill
Ireland, Phoebe Snow, Sheila

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:13.146 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
MacRae, Meredith MacRae, Stuart
Whitman, Lee Majors,

00:15:13.146 --> 00:15:15.815 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and Cliff Robertson are other
entertainers who have

00:15:15.815 --> 00:15:18.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
reportedly seen flying
saucers.

00:15:18.184 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Jackie Gleason told his friends
and family that he had

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.157 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
seen the preserved body of an
alien courtesy of his close

00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:26.826 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
friend, then President
Richard Nixon.

00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:29.829 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It probably won't come as a
surprise that Shirley MacLaine

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
has seen UFOs, or that singer
Michael Jackson reportedly was

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
interested in building
a UFO landing pad.

00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But other names may seem out
of place in such company.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.643 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
British statesman Winston
Churchill was so curious about

00:15:43.643 --> 00:15:47.647 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
UFOs that he ordered a formal
study to be conducted.

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:51.017 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Dictator Joseph Stalin did the
same in the Soviet Union in

00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:53.519 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
the late 1940s.

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:57.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was
so enamored of UFOs that he

00:15:57.356 --> 00:16:00.459 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
ordered his engineers to design
a flying saucer like

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.461 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
secret weapon.

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:05.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In the 1960s, future president
Gerald Ford was one of the

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:08.467 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
leading congressional voices
in calling for

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:10.469 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
hearings into UFOs.

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:13.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Also in the '60s, United Nations
Secretary General U

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:17.476 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Thant said that only the ongoing
Vietnam War was more

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:21.080 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
important to the world than
the mystery of UFOs.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Astronauts, astronomers,
physicists,

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.252 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
military officers, inventors.

00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:29.388 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
People from every walk of life,
every income level and

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:34.060 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
education background, rural
and urban, have seen UFOs.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.029 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Kent Oram is a big city, highly
successful political

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:40.499 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
consultant who was run scores
of successful campaigns,

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:43.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
including those of Nevada's
governor, lieutenant governor,

00:16:43.636 --> 00:16:45.504 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and Attorney General.

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:48.407 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Bradley Waddell is an assistant
fire chief and part

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:51.611 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
time rancher in a small
north Alabama town.

00:16:51.611 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Both had unforgettable
sightings.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.949 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-And at the time I made a joke
to my wife, I mean, if you

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:59.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
were under the Starship
Enterprise, that's sort of

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
what it might look like.

00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:03.656 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And it was, I would say, it was
gigantic, and it was more

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:06.926 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of a square shape, but it
was a lot of lights.

00:17:06.926 --> 00:17:10.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And so I had a pair of
binoculars in the back of my

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.231 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Ram Charger, so I went
to get them.

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:14.433 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We finally found them, and then
we looked up in the sky

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:15.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and it was gone.

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:17.536 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I mean, just flat gone.

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:20.106 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Waddell says he and
three other witnesses saw a

00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:25.177 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
brightly lit UFO land in a
wooded area near his home.

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:27.546 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-It was real huge, and it had
a lot of lights on it.

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:32.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It had red and green lights, and
some white lights, and it

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:34.186 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
was real round.

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And so we turned around and come
back, and go to sit there

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and watch it, and it was gone.

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:40.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
There wasn't no sound,
no nothing.

00:17:40.593 --> 00:17:42.561 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
There wasn't no lights,
no sound, no nothing.

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:45.932 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Just, that's what it looked
like, was a flying saucer.

[music playing]

00:18:03.616 --> 00:18:06.585 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: An English scientist
once wrote, it's the customary

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:09.655 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
fate of new truths to begin
as heresies and end as

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:11.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
superstitions.

00:18:11.324 --> 00:18:15.428 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
To modern mainstream science,
UFOs represent both heresy and

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.662 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
superstition.

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:20.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In 1968, the late Dr. J. Allen
Hynek testified before

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:23.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Congress that the legitimate
study of UFOs is

00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:25.438 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
a scientific taboo.

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:26.839 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It simply isn't done.

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:29.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In Hynek's estimation, there
had never been a fair and

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:33.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
objective study of the UFO
phenomenon, at least none that

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:35.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
had ever been released to the
public, and little has changed

00:18:35.915 --> 00:18:37.583 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
since then.

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:40.319 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Modern scientists are all but
certain that intelligent life

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:42.621 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
exists elsewhere in
the universe.

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.523 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The law of averages
almost demands it.

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:51.263 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Billions of galaxies, each
containing billions of stars,

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:53.833 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
implies there could be untold
numbers of other

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:55.134 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
civilizations.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Societies far older than
our own, with greater

00:18:57.837 --> 00:19:00.006 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
technological capabilities.

00:19:00.006 --> 00:19:02.842 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Astronomer and pop science
writer Dr. Carl Sagan

00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:05.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
estimates there could be as many
as one million advanced

00:19:05.845 --> 00:19:09.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
civilizations in our galaxy
alone, but Sagan is also one

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:13.052 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of the most vocal critics
of the study of UFOs.

00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:16.322 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
He and others dismiss UFO
sightings on the basis of

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:19.492 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
probabilities, and what we
know of mankind's own

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
technological limitations.

00:19:21.394 --> 00:19:24.663 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In other words, they use theory
to explain away data.

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:28.267 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
UFOs can't exist, therefore
they don't.

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:31.003 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Any scientist that takes the
time to look at the data, and

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:33.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the facts and the evidence
accepts the fact

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:34.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that we have UFOs.

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:36.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You have to have an open mind.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If you simply make the statement
there's nothing to

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:42.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
this thing and ignore it, people
like Carl Sagan, who's

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.985 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a brilliant astrophysicist, he's
never bothered to read

00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.821 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the UFO material, and pretend
there's nothing there, so

00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:50.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
don't bother me with
the facts.

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:53.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: One example is Dr.
Sagan's 1993 foray into

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.694 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
alleged alien abductions.

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:58.831 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Sagan is certainly qualified to
speak about astronomy, but

00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:02.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
strayed far afield when, in an
article for Parade Magazine,

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
he flatly dismissed all
abduction reports as the

00:20:05.738 --> 00:20:09.275 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
result of hallucinations, or
other mental disturbances.

00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:12.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Not only is Sagan lacking in
psychiatric expertise, he's

00:20:12.812 --> 00:20:15.414 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
personally investigated
only a handful of

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:17.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
alleged abduction cases.

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:23.155 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-Carl Sagan has what I call the
arrogance of ignorance.

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:27.726 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He is a person who has enough
arrogance to believe that he

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:33.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
can answer the UFO and abduction
mystery through lack

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
of knowledge.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.636 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He does not know much about
the subject of UFOs, he

00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:39.605 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
certainly doesn't know anything
about the subject of

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:42.241 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
abductions, other than what he's
read in debunking books.

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Even though he had seven critics
to the article before

00:20:45.778 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it was published absolutely
destroying his material, not

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.085 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
just on a theoretical
basis, but on a

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
factual basis as well.

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:58.324 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
All of these letters to him
before the article was

00:20:58.324 --> 00:21:00.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
published were simply ignored.

00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:02.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: Dr. Sagan declined our
request for an interview,

00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:06.765 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but his disdain for ufology cuts
a wide swath in science,

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:10.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and influences the views held by
other honest but uninformed

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.338 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
academicians.

00:21:12.338 --> 00:21:14.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-If anyone would bring in some
little green men and they

00:21:14.974 --> 00:21:16.976 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
would run around on my
conference table, I would

00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:18.978 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
consider that convincing.

00:21:18.978 --> 00:21:22.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
See, but absent that kind of
physical evidence, I remain

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:23.782 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
very skeptical.

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:29.088 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
-To the extent that there
ever is any evidence or

00:21:29.088 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
documentation to be looked at,
it is looked at by scientists,

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.497 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
astronomers, scientists
of other types.

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:42.468 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's that in the vast majority
of the cases, there isn't

00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:44.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
anything to study.

00:21:44.937 --> 00:21:47.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-None of the scientists who talk
about black holes have a

00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:48.807 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
piece of a black hole either.

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:51.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You might have noticed that.

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:53.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
That's part of the
problem with not

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:54.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
dealing with the evidence.

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
After, all we have 4,400
physical trace cases from 65

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.852 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
countries, last time
I checked.

00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Now, when people tell you
there's no evidence and then

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
ignore the physical trace cases,
I've had lab tests done

00:22:05.124 --> 00:22:07.826 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
on dirt that's been affected by
the saucer compared to dirt

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:09.595 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that wasn't affected.

00:22:09.595 --> 00:22:12.665 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
There's some very concrete
and definite differences.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:20.906 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-If intelligent life out there
is found, that will be the

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:25.344 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
most important discovery in
the history of mankind.

00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:26.745 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:18%
Period.

00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:28.347 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
NARRATOR: Astronomer Doug
Hall, like most of his

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:31.016 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
colleagues, would give almost
anything to be around when

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:34.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
contact with other intelligent
life is confirmed.

00:22:34.253 --> 00:22:36.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
He just doesn't think it's going
to happen anytime soon,

00:22:36.956 --> 00:22:38.857 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and is certain there's
not a speck of

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:41.193 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
evidence related to UFOs.

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:44.697 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-There is no evidence that
we have been visited.

00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:46.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The evidence just isn't there.

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.267 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: There how much study
have you done on the topic?

00:22:48.267 --> 00:22:50.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I mean, how much of the data
have you looked at?

00:22:50.903 --> 00:22:55.874 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-I myself, that's not my actual
field of expertise, but

00:22:55.874 --> 00:23:00.246 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I've read a virtually all the
articles critically that have

00:23:00.246 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
dealt with it.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.283 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: If Doug Hall were to
read every scientific article

00:23:04.283 --> 00:23:07.219 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
about UFOs that has been
published during the past 20

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.788 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
years, he wouldn't need
five minutes.

00:23:09.788 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Simply put, there
have been none.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Scientific journals do not
publish articles about UFOs or

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:18.897 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
aliens, or anything that even
hints at such topics.

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.900 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Science has already made up its
mind about these matters,

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and no amount of new information
is going to change

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:25.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
this perception.

00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:28.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-There was a reception of 300
Ph.D. Astronomers in Victoria,

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:31.777 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
British Columbia, and somebody
announced that there was a UFO

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:33.312 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
outside the building.

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:35.748 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Not one astronomer went
out to take a look.

00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:37.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's just too big a risk
in their profession.

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:40.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If an Astronomer, Ph.D.
astronomer actually saw a UFO,

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:44.657 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and I know secretly they want
to, and then if they reported

00:23:44.657 --> 00:23:47.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that to an audience, they may be
cut off from their grants,

00:23:47.293 --> 00:23:50.829 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
or they may risk the judgment
of their peers.

00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:53.332 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Dr. O'Leary has had
personal experience with the

00:23:53.332 --> 00:23:56.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
wrath of mainstream science, but
it didn't begin that way.

00:23:56.935 --> 00:24:00.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He started on a path that is
as mainstream as it gets, a

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:04.243 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Ph.D. In astronomy from Cal
Berkeley, taught at Princeton

00:24:04.243 --> 00:24:07.413 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and at Cornell with Carl Sagan,
and was selected over

00:24:07.413 --> 00:24:09.948 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
thousands of other applicants
by NASA for a

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:11.684 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
manned mission to Mars.

00:24:11.684 --> 00:24:15.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He too was skeptical UFOs, but
when O'Leary began to make

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:18.357 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
serious inquiries into the
topic, as well as into other

00:24:18.357 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
so-called pseudosciences,
he found himself

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.062 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
a scientific outcast.

00:24:23.062 --> 00:24:25.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-People like Randy the Magician,
even Carl Sagan, who

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:29.435 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
was a close colleague of mine
when I was at Cornell will

00:24:29.435 --> 00:24:31.337 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
attempt to debunk
and discredit.

00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:36.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's very kind of knee jerk,
emotional response, and it's

00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:37.976 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
not befitting of a scientist.

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:40.979 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Because after all, science is
supposed to be free and open

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:44.650 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
inquiry into the unknown, and
we scientists have tended to

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:45.718 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
forget that.

00:24:45.718 --> 00:24:47.386 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
NARRATOR: The grants
may be the key.

00:24:47.386 --> 00:24:50.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Of the $140 billion dollars
spent each year on research in

00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:54.360 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the US, fully 1/2 comes from
the federal government.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It means that, if the government
doesn't want UFO

00:24:56.995 --> 00:24:59.732 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
research to be done, it
simply won't be done.

00:24:59.732 --> 00:25:02.534 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And if it is done, it won't get
published anywhere that

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:05.003 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
professionals like Doug
Hall would be likely

00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:06.472 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
to read about it.

00:25:06.472 --> 00:25:09.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-Galileo's colleagues refused to
look through his telescope

00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:12.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because they didn't believe it
could make things look bigger.

00:25:12.044 --> 00:25:15.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And in the 17th century, the
French Academy of Sciences

00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:19.084 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
refused to believe meteorites
existed because rocks can't

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:20.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
fall out of the sky.

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:23.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And so I think that's what's
happening right now with the

00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:24.356 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
UFO phenomenon.

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:28.026 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-The leading scientists have
gone out of their way to

00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:29.561 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
attack ufology.

00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:32.197 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You know, it's been kind of
strange with the SETI stuff.

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You know, they turned on the
instrumentation for that

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.035 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
microwave searching device.

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:38.904 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They've gotten $100
million for 10

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:40.606 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
years worth of listening.

00:25:40.606 --> 00:25:43.275 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And in almost all the articles
about that, you'll find an

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:44.743 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
attack on UFOs.

00:25:44.743 --> 00:25:47.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What we're doing is science,
but not that UFO junk.

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:50.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: Science is supposed to
represent the investigation

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:53.051 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of the unexplained, not
the explanation of the

00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
uninvestigated.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Today, mainstream science acts
almost like a religion.

00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:02.027 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Rigid, unyielding with its own
special rules, and rights, and

00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:03.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
limitations.

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:06.432 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Anything which falls outside
these rules of reality simply

00:26:06.432 --> 00:26:07.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
can't exist.

00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:10.068 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Don't worry about the
scientific community, because

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:12.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
science has become
the religion of

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:13.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
this period of time.

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:15.607 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It is not science any longer.

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:17.075 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
It is theology.

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:19.611 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It is what has replaced
theology.

00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:22.614 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: This means the study
of UFOs is largely left to

00:26:22.614 --> 00:26:26.084 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
well meaning but sometimes
untrained, underfinanced

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:29.087 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
outsiders, such as UFO
organizations.

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Many of these amateur
investigators, like mainstream

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
scientists, already have their
minds made up about UFOs, and

00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:39.097 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
this only serves to further
lessen the credibility of UFO

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:43.135 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
research in the eyes of already
hostile scientists.

00:26:43.135 --> 00:26:46.104 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Most of this attitude seems to
flow from the government or,

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:48.807 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
more specifically, from the
military, which has a

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:53.011 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
longstanding, documentable
interest in ridiculing UFOs

00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and UFO researchers.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.549 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If the government controls the
research money, it controls

00:26:57.549 --> 00:27:00.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the research, and it has
repeatedly gone out of its way

00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:03.856 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to make certain that UFO studies
remain in the company

00:27:03.856 --> 00:27:06.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of fairy tales and Dr.
Seuss stories.

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:08.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The question is why.

00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:18.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Those who argue UFOs might be
cultural byproducts induced by

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:21.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
movies, or books, or advertising
have difficulty

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:24.142 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
explaining how the same
phenomenon can be reported in

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:27.112 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
virtually every culture and
on every continent.

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:30.616 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
For example, in the late 1980s,
an estimated 10,000

00:27:30.616 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Belgians reported seeing a
triangular UFO the size of a

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
football field over the period
of several months.

00:27:37.556 --> 00:27:41.393 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The Belgian Air Force tracked
the UFOs on radar, initiated

00:27:41.393 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
airborne chases, and launched
a formal study.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:49.668 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
From 1983 until 1986, as many
as 9,000 witnesses in the

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:52.404 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Hudson Valley region of New
York and Connecticut

00:27:52.404 --> 00:27:55.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
reportedly saw a nearly
identical flying triangle,

00:27:55.707 --> 00:27:58.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
along with huge aerial
boomerangs.

00:27:58.243 --> 00:28:01.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Several photos and videos of
the objects were captured.

00:28:01.747 --> 00:28:05.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In the southeastern US, the same
huge triangular mystery

00:28:05.217 --> 00:28:09.021 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
craft has been seen by scores
of longtime residents dating

00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:10.322 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
back to the '60s.

00:28:10.322 --> 00:28:12.190 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
-We've seen planes, and
helicopters, and stuff.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.093 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They'd just be sitting still
and light, then all of a

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:16.295 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
sudden they just-- pew.

00:28:16.295 --> 00:28:18.196 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And then it'd be gone
plum out of sight.

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:19.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Next thing you know,
just gone.

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:20.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-It's just like it happened.

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:21.867 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
It looked like--

00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:23.201 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
well, it looked like it was
just moving like that.

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:24.903 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Saw it, it wasn't
going that fast.

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:26.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The way it come over us, we
thought, we about decided it

00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:28.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
stopped on us, nearly.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
But it hadn't.

00:28:29.675 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And then when it was
there, it was gone.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.011 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
INTERVIEWER: Just like, poof.

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:33.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:16%
-Yeah.

00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:34.379 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:21%
But it--

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:35.414 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Now, we didn't see
it speed up.

00:28:35.414 --> 00:28:36.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
We don't know what
happened to it.

00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We just didn't see it no more.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
It's gone.

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:41.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Now, reports of this
same flying triangle are

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
surfacing in Africa.

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:46.224 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Africa, Belgium, New
York, Alabama.

00:28:46.224 --> 00:28:49.227 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Four distinct cultures with
different influences.

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.763 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Books and movies didn't make
them all see the same

00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:53.231 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
thing in the sky.

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:56.234 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
What's more, the late Dr. Allen
Hynek in his book "Night

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:59.271 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Siege," asserts that at least
100 other communities have

00:28:59.271 --> 00:29:04.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
seen the same big triangle
since the mid 1970s.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:08.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It has been this way since the
beginning of recorded history.

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:11.817 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
UFO-like vehicles are found
in ancient cave drawings.

00:29:11.817 --> 00:29:14.753 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There are numerous references in
the Bible which could just

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:18.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as easily be attributed to
aliens as to angels, including

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:21.259 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the prophet Ezekiel's encounter
with a burning

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:24.563 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
bronze wheel from the sky and
its four otherworldly

00:29:24.563 --> 00:29:27.132 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
passengers.

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:30.435 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and
Mayans reported flying

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:33.171 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
machines and odd beings
very similar

00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to modern UFO sightings.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Australian Aborigines and
indigenous American tribes

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
tell similar tales of beings
and craft from the sky.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.649 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The Greeks and Romans
called them

00:29:43.649 --> 00:29:46.018 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
flying shields or chariots.

00:29:46.018 --> 00:29:48.954 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In the Middle Ages, Irish
scribes wrote of demon

00:29:48.954 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
airships and the strange
beings who flew them.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:56.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Wood carvings from 1500
Switzerland record unusual

00:29:56.294 --> 00:29:58.864 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
balls of light, seemingly
controlled by some

00:29:58.864 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
intelligence, and hundreds of
strange airships were reported

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in newspapers all across the
US during America's first

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:07.305 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
great UFO wave.

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:11.276 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
That in the 1890s, years before
dirigibles or the

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:13.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Wright brothers' first flight.

00:30:13.311 --> 00:30:16.648 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-I would not exclude
categorically that we had a

00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:18.450 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
high technological civilization
on it.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.186 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Why not, there is still the
story of Atlantis and all

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.387 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
these things.

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:26.224 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But even they had a high
technological civilization in

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:29.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the past, this, again,
does not exclude the

00:30:29.061 --> 00:30:32.497 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
extra-terrestrials, because
anyhow, we have clear

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:36.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
writings, even with interviews
where mankind asks their

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:38.336 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
teacher, where did
you come from?

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:40.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And the answer is, we came
from the universe.

00:30:40.739 --> 00:30:42.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
NARRATOR: UFOs have come
in all sizes and

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:44.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
shapes over the centuries.

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:48.346 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Cigars, disks, fireballs,
footballs, barbells, boxes,

00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:50.682 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
diamonds, walnuts
and wash tubs.

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:53.952 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We can't say for sure how many
sightings there have been, but

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:56.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it's likely that 90%
of them are nothing

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:58.857 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to get excited about.

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:01.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Meteors, for example, are
sometimes mistaken for UFOs,

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.496 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
as this one was back in 1972.

00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:07.099 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Some clouds look like UFOs.

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:10.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Atmospheric phenomena, including
ball lightning, can

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:12.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
also be mistaken for
flying saucers.

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:16.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Weather balloons, too, and
conventional aircraft.

00:31:16.308 --> 00:31:19.745 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The most common UFO culprit is
probably the planet Venus,

00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
along with other stars and
planets, according to many

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
astronomers.

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:26.785 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
While it's true that 9 of 10
UFO sightings are probably

00:31:26.785 --> 00:31:29.788 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
mistakes, it's also true
that 9 out of 10 are

00:31:29.788 --> 00:31:31.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
never reported at all.

00:31:31.423 --> 00:31:34.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The main reason for that
is fear of ridicule.

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:37.162 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Just this perfectly straight
line, and it was going too

00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:39.064 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
fast for anything we've got.

00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:41.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: J.B. Langley has spent
his entire life in the

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:42.634 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Appalachian Mountains.

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:45.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
He and nearly every other member
of his family have seen

00:31:45.437 --> 00:31:48.306 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
UFOs, which they called
ghost lights, as

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:50.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
far back as the 1930s.

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:51.877 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
They haven't tried
to get rich, they

00:31:51.877 --> 00:31:53.411 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
haven't asked for attention.

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:55.814 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In fact, the Langleys have been
afraid to talk about what

00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:58.116 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
they've seen until now.

00:31:58.116 --> 00:32:02.154 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Sort of like everybody knows
everybody, and you get to

00:32:02.154 --> 00:32:03.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
going around, spreading rumors
like that, they'll

00:32:03.989 --> 00:32:05.423 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
say, well, he's nuts.

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:10.529 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And pretty soon, you wouldn't
have anybody to talk to.

00:32:10.529 --> 00:32:15.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But you know what you see,
and you know when you're

00:32:15.367 --> 00:32:17.068 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
imagining it or not.

00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:19.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I know some of the
stuff I've seen, I

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:20.472 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
didn't imagine it.

00:32:20.472 --> 00:32:22.440 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
NARRATOR: Langley's fears
are well founded.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.277 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
If you see a UFO, you
must be unbalanced.

00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:27.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
At least, that's a prevalent
view, even for

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:29.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
highly credible witnesses.

00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:33.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In 1979, a decorated Tennessee
police lieutenant, along with

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:37.189 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
seven other officers and 12
other witnesses watched two

00:32:37.189 --> 00:32:40.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
UFOs perform incredible
maneuvers for several minutes.

00:32:40.859 --> 00:32:43.528 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
A psychologist later surmised
that it was all in their

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:46.031 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
heads, brought on by stress.

00:32:46.031 --> 00:32:48.834 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Pilot John Lear, who has held
every flight rating, and his

00:32:48.834 --> 00:32:51.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
father invented the Learjet,
says he was fired from a

00:32:51.837 --> 00:32:53.471 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
charter company after admitting

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:55.340 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
his interest in UFOs.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.709 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Airline veteran John
Komar says such

00:32:57.709 --> 00:33:00.212 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
fears are not uncommon.

00:33:00.212 --> 00:33:02.480 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I mean, would an airline
actually fire someone who

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.816 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
reported one of these things?

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
-Quite possibly.

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:08.019 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: A more practical
problem in getting people to

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:11.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
report UFOs is that no one seems
interested in taking

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:12.858 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
such reports.

00:33:12.858 --> 00:33:16.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
UFO organizations will listen,
but few people in official

00:33:16.261 --> 00:33:18.029 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
positions want to be bothered.

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:19.998 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Just try it sometime.

00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:23.368 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Call your local airport control
tower to report a UFO,

00:33:23.368 --> 00:33:24.569 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and see what happens.

00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:26.504 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
They simply don't
want to hear it.

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:29.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Most police agencies will listen
to UFO callers, but not

00:33:29.708 --> 00:33:32.077 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
because they want information
on the citing.

00:33:32.077 --> 00:33:34.813 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Many times they keep the caller
on the line long enough

00:33:34.813 --> 00:33:37.782 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to determine if he or she
might be unstable.

00:33:37.782 --> 00:33:40.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And military authorities are
adamant in their statements

00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:44.089 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that they have no interest
whatsoever in UFOs.

00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:46.758 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Air Force spokesmen will tell
the caller that they stopped

00:33:46.758 --> 00:33:51.663 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
taking UFO reports in 1969, a
claim which, as we'll learn,

00:33:51.663 --> 00:33:53.064 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
is far from credible.

00:34:02.941 --> 00:34:05.577 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Most people trace the beginning
of the modern UFO

00:34:05.577 --> 00:34:08.713 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
era to an Idaho pilot and
businessman named Kenneth

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:13.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Arnold, whose sighting of nine
silvery UFOs in June 1947

00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:16.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
spawned the term flying saucers,
and kicked off a

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:19.224 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
nationwide UFO frenzy.

00:34:19.224 --> 00:34:21.559 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
What neither Arnold nor the rest
of the world knew at the

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:25.563 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
time was that the US military
was already conducting full

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:29.200 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
scale secret studies of
the so-called saucers.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.237 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
After all, UFO sightings had
been common in the final

00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:33.571 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
months of World War II.

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:35.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Foo-Fighters, they
were called.

00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:37.809 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The Allies thought they
were Nazi weapons.

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:40.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The Nazis, we learned later,
thought they were ours.

00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:43.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
When the odd vehicle started
popping up in the US following

00:34:43.982 --> 00:34:46.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the war, it became readily
apparent that

00:34:46.351 --> 00:34:47.886 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
something was going on.

00:34:47.886 --> 00:34:51.589 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Today, military officials
laughingly insist that UFOs

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:54.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
are largely imaginary,
not a threat at all.

00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:58.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But it was a far different story
four decades ago, before

00:34:58.163 --> 00:35:00.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the alleged cover up was
fully implemented.

00:35:00.799 --> 00:35:05.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
As early as 1948, top secret
studies by the Army and FBI

00:35:05.637 --> 00:35:09.274 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
had concluded that whatever was
flying around was real,

00:35:09.274 --> 00:35:12.610 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
metallic, capable of incredible
maneuvers, and of

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.979 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
unknown origin.

00:35:13.979 --> 00:35:16.948 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Subsequent studies by the Air
Force concluded matter of

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:20.986 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
factly that the craft were most
likely extraterrestrial,

00:35:20.986 --> 00:35:24.956 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but the public wasn't allowed
to hear those conclusions.

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:31.696 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
-There was a report
issued in 1949.

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:39.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Classified document then,
stating that the Air Force had

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:42.841 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
by that point in time,
investigated some x number of

00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:44.109 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
citing cases.

00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:45.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
x number of UFO cases.

00:35:45.677 --> 00:35:51.649 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
80% remained unexplained in
1949, yet they were telling

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:54.886 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the public at that time, in
public press releases dated

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:59.657 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the same month, that only 10%
remained unexplained.

00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:01.226 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Flat out lied to the press.

00:36:01.226 --> 00:36:03.228 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Why did they do that?

00:36:03.228 --> 00:36:05.530 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: It is a question that
is still being asked.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:06.698 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:11%
Why?

00:36:06.698 --> 00:36:09.667 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Whatever the answer, the
pentagon's approach to UFOs

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:13.538 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
changed, encouraged by
recommendations from the CIA,

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:16.674 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which urged that UFOs be
stripped of their aura of

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:19.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
mystery, lest some foreign
enemy exploit them.

00:36:19.878 --> 00:36:23.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
From the early '50s on, military
studies of UFOs were,

00:36:23.882 --> 00:36:25.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in the view of many,
little more than

00:36:25.717 --> 00:36:28.219 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
public relations exercises.

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:32.857 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-Yes, there has been a clear cut
solid, strong, I'll call

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:35.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it propaganda effort
of disinformation,

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:36.795 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
right from the start.

00:36:36.795 --> 00:36:39.297 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: In the ensuing
decades, hundreds of former

00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
military personnel have come
forward to tell of their UFO

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.670 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
experiences, and of the evidence
they viewed with

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.838 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
their own eyes.

00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:49.274 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
-We succeeded in getting,
collecting information

00:36:49.274 --> 00:36:53.545 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
probably two or three times a
week, and some of the cases,

00:36:53.545 --> 00:36:56.347 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of the contact cases were
quite spectacular.

00:36:56.347 --> 00:37:00.552 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They were seen to descend,
and land on the ice.

00:37:00.552 --> 00:37:03.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They were seen to take off
from the ice and snow.

00:37:03.088 --> 00:37:05.723 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They were seen to land in the
water up there, the open

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:08.693 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
water, and descend underwater.

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:10.295 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Others were seen coming
out of water.

00:37:10.295 --> 00:37:13.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-They were traveling at such
rates of speed, the sweep on

00:37:13.398 --> 00:37:16.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the radar comes around
every five seconds.

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:19.804 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The rate of speed was so great
we could not-- it disappeared

00:37:19.804 --> 00:37:23.108 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
off the radar before we
could get up, check

00:37:23.108 --> 00:37:24.242 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the speed on them.

00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:26.077 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: How fast is that?

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:28.213 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Well, it was well over 2,00.

00:37:28.213 --> 00:37:29.314 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
Well over.

00:37:29.314 --> 00:37:30.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
NARRATOR: This is back
in the '50s?

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:31.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-This is back in a '50s, yeah.

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:35.487 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-The next morning the Alaskan
Air Command issued a general

00:37:35.487 --> 00:37:38.256 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
order to all personnel and
civilian personnel, all

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:40.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
military and civilian personnel,
a gag order in

00:37:40.792 --> 00:37:44.963 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
essence, that what you thought
you saw and heard on the

00:37:44.963 --> 00:37:47.765 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
previous day to this directive,
you did not see,

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:49.701 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and you did not hear.

00:37:49.701 --> 00:37:51.102 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And it did not happen.

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:53.771 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Critics insist that
a secret of this magnitude

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:56.774 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
could never be kept, and that
even if it were, the Freedom

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:59.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of Information Act would allow
access to all relevant

00:37:59.878 --> 00:38:01.346 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
government documents.

00:38:01.346 --> 00:38:04.516 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In reality, this isn't much
of a secret anymore.

00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:07.418 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Too many people have testified
about their personal

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:10.655 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
involvement in UFO intelligence
operations.

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:13.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The question is, why have so few
people paid attention to

00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:15.026 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
those stories?

00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:17.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
As for the Freedom of
Information Act, it's been

00:38:17.362 --> 00:38:20.665 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
invaluable in forcing the
release of thousands of UFO

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:24.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
documents, but even its greatest
supporters admit that

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:27.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the most sensitive information
is still being withheld.

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:29.207 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Those documents which
are released are

00:38:29.207 --> 00:38:30.775 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
often heavily censored.

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:33.011 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Many files are never
released at all.

00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:36.214 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The very existence of other
records is falsely denied.

00:38:36.214 --> 00:38:38.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
-You're dealing with the
biggest story of the

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:40.118 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
millennium.

00:38:40.118 --> 00:38:42.020 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Certainly worthy of the
attention of the news media,

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.822 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
historians, and scientists,
and a lot of other people,

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:48.159 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
namely that the planet is indeed
being visited, and what

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.828 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the best evidence has
been kept secret

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:53.731 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
successfully for 45 years.

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:57.435 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: On New Year's Eve
1978, a TV crew flying between

00:38:57.435 --> 00:39:00.471 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
New Zealand and Australia
captured some amazing, if

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:03.841 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
bumpy, footage of a bright
object which seemingly danced

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:05.343 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
around the plane.

00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:08.079 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Debunkers dismissed the footage,
saying it showed,

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:11.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
depending on the critic, a
planet, a meteor, a plane,

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
headlights, a lighthouse,
moonlight on cabbage patches,

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and other unsupported excuses.

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:20.858 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Even though radar operators
confirmed it to be a solid,

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:23.394 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
moving airborne object.

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:25.697 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Similar footage and photos
have been captured

00:39:25.697 --> 00:39:27.365 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
all over the world.

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:31.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Guatemala, 1976.

00:39:31.536 --> 00:39:35.740 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Southern England, 1973.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
Italy, 1960.

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:41.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
Belgium, 1977.

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:45.049 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It is abundantly clear from the
photos and witnesses that

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:48.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the UFO phenomenon is not an
American mystery, it's a

00:39:48.453 --> 00:39:49.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
worldwide mystery.

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:53.558 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Saucers, disks, cigars and
fireballs have been seen in

00:39:53.558 --> 00:39:56.461 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
virtually every nation on the
planet, and have been studied

00:39:56.461 --> 00:39:57.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
by numerous governments.

00:39:57.762 --> 00:40:00.898 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But like the USA, most
governments are not very

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:03.401 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
forthcoming about
UFO information.

00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:06.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
British writer Tim Good, who's
bestselling book "Above Top

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:11.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Secret," details UFO cases
worldwide is convinced there

00:40:11.042 --> 00:40:13.411 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
is cooperation between
governments in

00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:15.113 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
maintaining the cover up.

00:40:15.113 --> 00:40:18.683 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-Many governments haven't the
faintest idea what's going on.

00:40:18.683 --> 00:40:21.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They have no need to know, and
they haven't been filled in on

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:24.889 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the full picture by any
of the major world

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:26.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
powers, in my opinion.

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:29.327 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So, it's not a world wide cover
up to that extent, but

00:40:29.327 --> 00:40:32.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
there is an interchange of
information, but at an above

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:33.464 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
top secret level.

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:34.565 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
INTERVIEWER: You're
certain of that?

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:36.634 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
-I'm absolutely certain
of it, yes.

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:39.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Good's contention is
supported by Robert Dean, a

00:40:39.304 --> 00:40:42.774 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
military intelligence officer
assigned to NATO headquarters

00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:44.609 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in Europe during the '60s.

00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:48.813 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Dean says he personally read
an extensive report on UFOs

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:50.882 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
prepared for NATO allies.

00:40:50.882 --> 00:40:54.519 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-The conclusions were basically
in four parts.

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:57.955 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
One that the human race and
the planet Earth has been

00:40:57.955 --> 00:41:01.693 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
under a detailed survey of
some kind of by several--

00:41:01.693 --> 00:41:03.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and this was the part that
I found exciting--

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:08.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
several high technology,
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.169 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
for a long period of time.

00:41:11.169 --> 00:41:14.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This research, this survey, this
program, whatever it is,

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:18.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
had been going on not only
maybe for centuries.

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:20.044 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Maybe for thousands of years.

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:22.947 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Documents obtained
from US government files make

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:25.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it clear that the American
military has a long reach when

00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:27.552 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
it comes to UFOs.

00:41:27.552 --> 00:41:31.155 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In May 1986, for example,
the Brazilian Air Force

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:35.560 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
encountered at least 20 UFOs in
three distinct formations.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.330 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So many UFOs that their radar
scopes were saturated.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.133 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This self-described close
encounter was kept under

00:41:42.133 --> 00:41:45.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
wraps, with the official
reports ending up in

00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:46.037 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
Washington.

00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:47.472 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
June, 1980.

00:41:47.472 --> 00:41:51.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Peruvian jets had two encounters
with UFOs and fired

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:52.377 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
on one object.

00:41:52.377 --> 00:41:56.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The shots had no effect, and
the UFOs out ran the jets.

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:59.016 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Pentagon documents show the
Department of Defense got the

00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:02.220 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
files from a source in the
Peruvian Air Force.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Bolivia, August, 1979.

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:08.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
An object from space three times
the size of a basketball

00:42:08.393 --> 00:42:10.027 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
was found on a farm.

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:13.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Film of the object was quickly
set not to the Bolivian

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:15.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
government, but to Washington.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
Finland, 1982.

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:19.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
Belgium, 1990.

00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:21.773 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
Nepal, 1968.

00:42:21.773 --> 00:42:24.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
Ghana, 1987.

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:27.044 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
All of these foreign UFO
incidents somehow found their

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:30.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
way into the files of American
intelligence agencies, but few

00:42:30.948 --> 00:42:33.451 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
were reported publicly.

00:42:33.451 --> 00:42:35.052 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
[chanting]

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:38.055 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Cooperation from friendly
countries is one thing, but

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
what about our enemies
or former enemies?

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:43.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
How do they handle the UFO
matter, and is there any

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:46.063 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
cooperation between
them and us?

00:42:56.674 --> 00:43:00.077 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:23%
[singing]

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:02.713 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Mother Russia is
singing a new tune these days.

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:05.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The Berlin Wall has crumbled
and the Iron Curtain has

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.586 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
parted, allowing the Russian
people to experiment with a

00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:11.389 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
free market economy, and
allowing the rest of us a

00:43:11.389 --> 00:43:15.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
glimpse into a world that was,
by and large, sealed off from

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:17.128 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the outside for decades.

00:43:17.128 --> 00:43:20.465 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Even the KGB be has opened some
of its files to Western

00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:22.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
researchers and journalists.

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:25.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But what do Russians
know about UFOs?

00:43:25.036 --> 00:43:28.105 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It was assumed by Western
ufologists that the Soviets

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:31.309 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
were experiencing the same type
of UFO encounters as the

00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:34.345 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
rest of the world, but isolated
incidents were all

00:43:34.345 --> 00:43:35.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
outsiders heard about.

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:38.950 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
As tensions cooled and dialogue
began between the

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:42.787 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
east and the west, the UFO issue
was publicly breached.

00:43:42.787 --> 00:43:46.190 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In a 1989 issue of the magazine
"Soviet Military

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.694 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Review," Russian military
leaders argued in favor of an

00:43:49.694 --> 00:43:53.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
ongoing exchange of UFO
information with the West.

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:56.467 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In the view of the authors,
without such an exchange, a

00:43:56.467 --> 00:44:00.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
UFO might one day accidentally
trigger a nuclear exchange

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:04.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
between the superpowers on the
assumption that the UFO was an

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:05.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
enemy missile.

00:44:05.443 --> 00:44:08.145 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The article acknowledged that
UFOs were tracked by the

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:12.149 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
defense systems of the USSR, and
applied that the same must

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:13.417 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
be true in the US.

00:44:16.888 --> 00:44:20.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Shortly thereafter, Soviet
president Mikhail Gorbachev,

00:44:20.124 --> 00:44:23.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in response to repeated
statements by then President

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.630 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Ronald Reagan told Western
reporters that

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
he agreed with Reagan.

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:30.167 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
If the world were ever
threatened by outside powers,

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:32.904 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
our two nations would stand
side by side in

00:44:32.904 --> 00:44:34.305 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the defense of Earth.

00:44:34.305 --> 00:44:37.174 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Reagan alluded to this potential
threat in five

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:40.177 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
separate public speeches,
including an address to the

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:41.779 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
United Nations.

00:44:41.779 --> 00:44:46.183 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-I've often wondered, what
if all of us in the world

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:52.189 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
discovered that we were
threatened by an outer power

00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:55.760 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
from outer space, from
another planet?

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Wouldn't we all of a sudden find
that we didn't have any

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:00.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
differences between us at all?

00:45:00.565 --> 00:45:04.001 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We were all human beings,
citizens of the world?

00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:06.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And wouldn't we come
together to fight

00:45:06.504 --> 00:45:09.173 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that particular threat?

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:12.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: In November, 1989,
Soviet attitudes on UFOs

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:14.211 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
became abundantly clear.

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:17.248 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The official news agency TASS
reported on the alleged

00:45:17.248 --> 00:45:20.851 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
landing of an alien ship in
the city of Voronezh, a 10

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:23.220 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
hour train ride north
of Moscow.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.224 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
According to TASS, tall aliens
and a robot exited the space

00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:30.061 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
ship, walked around the
park, and then left.

00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:33.064 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The story was reported in the
"New York Times," "Wall Street

00:45:33.064 --> 00:45:35.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Journal," and on network news.

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.535 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
None of these major media
outlets had their own

00:45:37.535 --> 00:45:40.638 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
reporters on the scene, so most
chose the approach they

00:45:40.638 --> 00:45:42.773 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
normally take with UFO story.

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:46.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-Earlier tonight, the CBS
Evening News with Dan Rather

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:48.112 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
included a report about
the alleged

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:50.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
alien landing at Voronezh.

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:53.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Rather, Riley commented on
the Soviet claims about

00:45:53.818 --> 00:45:57.455 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
10-foot-tall aliens walking
around a Russian park.

00:45:57.455 --> 00:46:00.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The CBS newsman added,
don't believe

00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:02.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
everything you read in TASS.

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:05.262 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Within days, the
Voronezh story assumed almost

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:06.597 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
surreal proportions.

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:10.134 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
American headlines chortled
about pinhead aliens.

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:12.870 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Followup stories claimed that
the only witnesses to the

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
landing were young children,
and because the tall aliens

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:19.276 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
described were different from
the usual short, bug eyed

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:23.047 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
variety Americans hear about,
it was smugly assumed the

00:46:23.047 --> 00:46:24.749 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Russians must be wrong.

00:46:24.749 --> 00:46:27.785 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So much superfluous information
was added to media

00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:30.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
accounts that it took only
a few days to generally

00:46:30.655 --> 00:46:32.723 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
discredit the entire event.

00:46:32.723 --> 00:46:36.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Prominent astrophysicist Jacques
Vallee was one of few

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Westerners to personally
investigate the case by

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:41.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
meeting with Russian
sources firsthand.

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:45.603 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-In this Voronezh, there were
many cases, not just the case

00:46:45.603 --> 00:46:47.071 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that made the newspapers.

00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:51.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Not just the case that was
recorded by TASS with the

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
school students.

00:46:53.044 --> 00:46:54.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The witnesses were
not just kids.

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:56.847 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
They were 18, 19-year-old
kids.

00:46:56.847 --> 00:46:58.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Very articulate.

00:46:58.315 --> 00:46:59.817 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And obviously, they had
seen something.

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:01.452 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
There were physical
traces there.

00:47:01.452 --> 00:47:04.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But there were many other cases,
over 1,000 witnesses in

00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:06.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
all in the city of Voronezh.

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:07.892 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Voronezh is a large city.

00:47:07.892 --> 00:47:09.460 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's over a million people.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:13.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What they showed me was the
film, the physical evidence.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:16.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They told me about the cases
in which, for example, an

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:20.204 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
object hovered near a nuclear
power plant in Voronezh and a

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:22.339 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
beam from that object melted
the asphalt there.

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.175 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And that's what they
are studying now.

00:47:24.175 --> 00:47:26.544 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: The story Americans
read was much different from

00:47:26.544 --> 00:47:29.146 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
what the witnesses say
happened at Voronezh.

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:33.384 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Inside the USSR, the incident
helped unleash a long pent up

00:47:33.384 --> 00:47:35.352 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
interest in the UFO topic.

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:38.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
An interest that, by decree,
had been dormant until

00:47:38.756 --> 00:47:40.391 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Glasnost and Perestroika.

00:47:40.391 --> 00:47:43.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Suddenly, Russians were flocking
to newsstands to buy

00:47:43.427 --> 00:47:47.364 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the same sort of UFO tabloids
that Americans buy, filled

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:51.168 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
with lurid, sensational stories
about nasty aliens and

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:53.070 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
their dubious intentions.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:56.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
At the same time, UFO
organizations, including

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.443 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
respected scientists and
military officials, were free

00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:02.379 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to openly discuss UFO
cases and issues.

00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:05.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But still, little was made
public about what the Soviet

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:06.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
government might know.

00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:13.591 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In March, 1993, our
investigative team traveled to

00:48:13.591 --> 00:48:16.627 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Moscow to meet with current
and former government and

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:19.530 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
military officials concerning
UFO files.

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:25.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
[speaking russian]

00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:27.304 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: The journey was
undertaken during a period of

00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:30.708 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
dramatic political and social
upheaval in Russia, but few

00:48:30.708 --> 00:48:33.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
events could be as dramatic or
as important as what was

00:48:33.778 --> 00:48:36.413 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
uncovered about UFOs
and human knowledge

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:38.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of the alien presence.

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:41.452 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Russian physicist Nikolai
Kapranov, a national security

00:48:41.452 --> 00:48:44.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
advisor to the Soviet
parliament, spent months

00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:47.224 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
making the crucial contacts
with sources who would not

00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:50.127 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
otherwise be available to
Westerners, and who almost

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:52.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
certainly would never been
accessible to Western

00:48:52.563 --> 00:48:54.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
journalists.

00:48:54.098 --> 00:48:56.934 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Kapranov had heard rumblings
about UFO studies over the

00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:59.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
years, but he was far from
being a believer.

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:02.773 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That is, until he started asking
questions of people in

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:04.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
high places.

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:06.443 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
-More and more, I started
to think that this is

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:08.379 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
something for real.

00:49:08.379 --> 00:49:13.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And there are facts, and I've
seen some materials one can't,

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:14.985 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you know, just-- just drop.

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:17.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And what I learned about the UFO
is that they're certainly

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:23.060 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
for real, and that the UFO is
a one fragment of a very

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:26.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
diverse and strong phenomenon.

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.132 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The military people are looking

00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:29.834 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
at that very seriously.

00:49:29.834 --> 00:49:32.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: With Kapranov's
assistance, our team succeeded

00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:35.472 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in making contact with a
previously hidden echelon of

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:38.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
UFO researchers, dedicated
scientists who had pursued

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:41.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
their interest in alien visitors
during the darkest

00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:45.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
days of communism, and whose
findings have never before

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:46.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
seen the light of day.

00:49:46.517 --> 00:49:50.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
A government biologist who
analyzes soil samples from UFO

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:51.889 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
landing sites.

00:49:51.889 --> 00:49:54.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
A Moscow professor who has
secretly directed a discrete

00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:58.128 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
organization of high level
scientists and military

00:49:58.128 --> 00:50:00.798 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
personnel interested in UFOs.

00:50:00.798 --> 00:50:04.335 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
An author and physicist who
began studying UFOs in the

00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:07.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
'50s and who became a non-person
when he refused to

00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:10.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
quit talking and writing
about the subject.

00:50:10.507 --> 00:50:14.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
An engineer in the Russian SDI
program who asserts the Soviet

00:50:14.245 --> 00:50:18.515 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
military long ago determined
that UFOs were interplanetary

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:22.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and who says UFO data has been
incorporated into Russian beam

00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:24.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
weapon research.

00:50:24.088 --> 00:50:26.924 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And a shadowy man who currently
heads the ongoing

00:50:26.924 --> 00:50:32.429 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Ministry of Defense study
of UFOs and aliens.

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:35.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This man is Boris Sokolov a
retired Russian kernel colonel

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
from a distinguished
military family.

00:50:37.935 --> 00:50:41.672 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In 1978, Sokolov was given what
seemed like an unusual

00:50:41.672 --> 00:50:43.207 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
assignment.

00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:45.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Orders were handed down from
the Ministry of Defense to

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:48.746 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
every unit in the vast Soviet
military empire.

00:50:48.746 --> 00:50:52.116 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Every UFO sighting was to
be fully investigated.

00:50:52.116 --> 00:50:54.718 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
All of these reports were to
be funneled to Sokolov's

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:56.553 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
command for analysis.

00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:58.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
[speaking russian]

00:50:58.555 --> 00:51:03.394 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
First, an order was given to
those pilots to chase the UFO

00:51:03.394 --> 00:51:04.561 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and to shoot it.

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:11.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
There were 40 episodes
like this, like that.

00:51:11.302 --> 00:51:13.137 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Hundreds of Sokolov's
most intriguing

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:15.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
cases were compiled into
this thick volume.

00:51:15.973 --> 00:51:18.876 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Although much of the data is
still being evaluated, it

00:51:18.876 --> 00:51:21.679 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
appears the Russians accumulated
a mammoth amount

00:51:21.679 --> 00:51:23.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of information about UFOs.

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:26.183 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The assumption that these craft
were from somewhere

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:31.722 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
else, perhaps outer space,
became a foregone conclusion.

00:51:31.722 --> 00:51:33.590 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The importance of these
revelations is

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:34.959 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
difficult to overstate.

00:51:34.959 --> 00:51:37.995 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In Russia of all places, a
country still experimenting

00:51:37.995 --> 00:51:40.898 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
with democracy, it is now
permissible for former

00:51:40.898 --> 00:51:43.901 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
military men and government
scientists to admit a

00:51:43.901 --> 00:51:47.938 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
longstanding involvement in
clandestine UFO research.

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:51.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In America, the cradle of
freedom, it's another story.

00:51:56.914 --> 00:52:01.218 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The Pentagon, CIA, FBI, and
other intelligence agencies

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:04.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
deny any interest in UFOs,
although their own files

00:52:04.755 --> 00:52:06.323 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
indicate otherwise.

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:10.127 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Mainstream science says UFOs
can't be true, so they won't

00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:11.495 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
be studied.

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:13.764 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Big time journalism won't
touch this story with a

00:52:13.764 --> 00:52:15.466 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
10-foot typewriter.

00:52:15.466 --> 00:52:16.834 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
None of this matters.

00:52:16.834 --> 00:52:20.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
UFOs refuse to go away, and no
amount of official put downs

00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:22.406 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
will change this.

00:52:22.406 --> 00:52:25.642 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Regular people all over the
world almost instinctively

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:28.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
recognize that something
is happening.

00:52:28.312 --> 00:52:30.647 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
We all share a common
question.

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.449 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
What is going on?

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:34.051 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-I really would like to know.

00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:35.652 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
I really would.

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:39.356 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And I really would like
everybody to know.

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:41.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
-Oh, I'd absolutely like
to know what it was.

00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:45.396 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-I know just as sure as I'm
sitting here that there's--

00:52:45.396 --> 00:52:48.832 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
there's too much evidence
here and out there.

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:51.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-And hopefully, at some point,
there will be outrage to the

00:52:51.702 --> 00:52:54.671 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
point where people will begin
demanding of their elected

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:57.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
representatives, just what
the hell is going on.

00:52:57.508 --> 00:53:00.144 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-And we have enough information
to go by where we

00:53:00.144 --> 00:53:02.679 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
don't even have to wait for the
government to come forth

00:53:02.679 --> 00:53:05.115 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
with information or
disinformation.

00:53:05.115 --> 00:53:06.817 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
We already have a lot
of information

00:53:06.817 --> 00:53:08.218 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in the public domain.

00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:10.687 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So now it's incumbent
on us scientists to

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.022 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
work and see what--

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
what we can figure
out with this.

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:16.927 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-If you're not concerned or
interested in this, you're

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:18.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
simply uninformed.

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:21.328 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
