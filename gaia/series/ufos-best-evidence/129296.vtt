-Improvement of our defenses.

-I think that there
isn't a cover-up.

-He crashed following
a flying saucer.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:11.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-No government is going to admit
that this is going on,

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the most important event
in human history.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Secrecy and democracy
are, by definition,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.481 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
incompatible.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
An electorate which is denied
information is stripped of its

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
ability to make informed
decisions, yet the vaults of

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:30.457 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
official Washington are bulging
with classified

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:33.327 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
factoids and squirreled
away dossiers.

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:36.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The so-called black budget, from
which classified military

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:40.067 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
programs are funded, has
ballooned to $34 billion a

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:43.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
year, larger than the total
defense budgets of every other

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
nation except Russia, yet those
programs are completely

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
hidden from the American public
and all but a handful

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.712 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of elected officials.

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:55.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Conventional wisdom dictates
that secrets can't be kept,

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:58.418 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that Washington leaks like a
sieve, and that every story

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:01.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
gets told eventually, especially
a story as

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
potentially explosive as UFOs.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.559 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-But let me tell you, don't
think for a moment that

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.494 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
secrets can't be kept.

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:10.230 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The American taxpayer would have
a fit if he knew where

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.499 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
some of his tax money
was going.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
-Find me a civilian
organization

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.968 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that's got a radar.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Find me one that's
got a fast jet.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:17.938 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:23%
Find me--

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:19.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
all those things, take any
kind of electronic

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
countermeasures equipment,
what have you--

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
satellite detection.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.512 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Those things belong
to the government.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:28.515 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So whatever body of good data
exists on UFOs, as the

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.717 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
government has it, only because
they're the ones

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:33.353 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
capable of collecting it.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:36.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-There are no secrets better
kept wrote, George Bernard

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:39.226 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Shaw, then those secrets
that everybody guesses.

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:42.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Who among us has not heard about
an alleged UFO cover-up?

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The term itself may be a
misnomer, because over the

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:48.602 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
years, there have been more
than enough UFOs leaks,

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:53.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
exposes, and whistleblowers to
crack any cabal or conspiracy,

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:55.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
or so it would seem.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.045 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: But if the right
people don't pay attention,

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:00.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and if the right information
isn't exposed; if the

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
mainstream major media outlets
don't pursue the story, then a

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:07.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
non-secret can still
be a secret.

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:09.289 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
-The books are written.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.124 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The documents leak out.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.126 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
People talk.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:17.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But if there isn't a context for
the listener to believe it

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:20.901 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
is anything but science
fiction, it's denied.

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:25.038 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's the story they cannot be
told, because no one can

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
believe that it can be true.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.576 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Some UFO information,
documents, and

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.511 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
testimony has surfaced.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.712 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It's the other material--

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.581 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the most persuasive
materials--

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
which has not.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
-The best evidence has
been kept secret

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:41.521 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
successfully for 45 years.

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:42.956 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:19.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-You'd be surprised the folk
that's seen things, and afraid

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.628 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to tell anybody about it.

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:23.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Former Nashville,
Tennessee, Councilman George

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:27.167 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Darden has never seen a UFO, but
he thought he knew a good

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:28.635 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
deal when he saw one.

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.137 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
He was wrong.

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:32.639 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Darden hoped he could create
a few jobs and some tourist

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.444 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
income by building with city
funds a UFO landing pad, sort

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.647 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of a Nashville-style welcome
wagon for visitors from the

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:42.649 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Crab Nebula and beyond.

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The plan was defeated by a
council vote of 27 to 1.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.056 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-It got one vote, which was a
start, and that was my vote.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Darden then tried to
build the project with his own

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:55.295 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
money, but was denied necessary
permits by his

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.497 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
skeptical, amused colleagues.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:00.667 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The newspapers had a lot of fun
at his expense, and the

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Councilman even landed himself
on "The Joan Rivers Show."

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.207 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Politically, he was doomed,
and so was his idea.

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:09.676 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-People have come right here in
front of my house in tour

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.079 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
buses because it came on the
radio that I had built it in

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:15.515 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
my backyard, which I had not.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:17.884 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Darden says he never
thought aliens would actually

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.352 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
land in Nashville.

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.855 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
He merely thought UFOs
were a good gimmick.

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:24.758 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
What he didn't know is that the
seeds of his demise had

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:28.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
been planted decades before by
intelligence agencies who

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:31.865 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
secretly plotted to make certain
that the media and the

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:35.735 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
public would never take UFOs too
seriously, and that anyone

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:39.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
who did take UFOs seriously
would be subjected to ridicule

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.408 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
and laughter.

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:46.713 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-And all the way through, you
can trace a deliberate pattern

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:51.718 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of disinformation, deception,
the laughter curtain, the

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:56.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
ridicule, the debunking, the
UFO basher that came out--

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:58.491 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:23%
come out.

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
There's still a few of them
around- and say that anybody

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:03.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
involved with UFOs
is a crackpot.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.798 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
-And I fault the
media for that.

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:08.468 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They've never, ever taken the
time to look at the reality of

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:11.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it, to look at the evidence,
and talk to the people who

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
have firsthand knowledge.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.609 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They go out, and they'll talk
to some poor yoyo who's

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:18.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
wearing a beanie with a couple
of antennas up there, who

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:21.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
said, I've been aboard this
ship, and I went to Venus, and

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:22.916 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I had a love affair with.

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:26.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Well, the media focuses in on
that guy, but they won't focus

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:31.558 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in on a scientist or retired
military or a police officer

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
who can tell them first-hand
what I've seen, what's

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:35.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
happened, and what I know.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:42.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
NARRATOR: August 1950,
Missoula, Montana.

00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:45.338 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
A photographer captured movie
footage of two silvery

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:46.940 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
disk-shape objects.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The Air Force said it didn't
know what the objects were,

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:53.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but that it was possible the
craft were Air Force jets.

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:56.883 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Three years later, a panel of
CIA scientists dropped the

00:06:56.883 --> 00:07:00.186 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
word "possible" from the file,
and declared that the objects

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:02.589 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
were jets, contrary
to other evidence.

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:08.094 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Tremonton, Utah, July 1952.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.698 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
A Navy photographer filmed the
formation of flying objects,

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:14.801 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
which he later described
as disk-shape craft.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:18.171 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The Air Force and Navy
extensively analyzed the film,

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:22.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
decided it didn't show planes,
balloons, or birds, but didn't

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.843 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
say what the objects were.

00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:27.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The following year, the same
panel of CIA scientists

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:29.382 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
decided, after just
a few hours, that

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:32.819 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the film showed seagulls.

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Wisconsin, 1952.

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:38.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
A formation of UFOs is
confirmed on radar.

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.493 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
Bermuda 1954.

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:45.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Again, radar captures images
of craft described as UFOs.

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:48.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In the late '40s and early '50s,
it became abundantly

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:51.037 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
clear to governments around
the world that something

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:54.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
unusual really was flying
around, something that was

00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
seemingly beyond any
known technology.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Rather than admit their
ignorance and confront the

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:02.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
issue head on, governments
did then what

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.717 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
they tend to do today--

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:05.118 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
they lied.

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:09.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-I think, in a nut shell, that
the government painted itself

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:12.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
into a corner about UFOs
for very legitimate

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:16.629 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
reasons 45 years ago.

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:19.032 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And I think the paint's
still wet.

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:21.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They don't know what
to do about it.

00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:23.403 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
-Yeah, flying saucers--

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:26.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Lonnie James spent
26 years in the Air Force,

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:29.142 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
mostly as a radar operator, and
says he and others tracked

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:32.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
UFOs on numerous occasions
in New Mexico,

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:33.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Texas, and North Dakota.

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:37.283 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Higher-ups would routinely
issue lame excuses.

00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:38.885 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-We picked up an aircraft--

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:40.887 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
or a blip, I should say--

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:46.426 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
on the radar scope that was
acting very strangely, making

00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:49.729 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
90 degree turns on the scope.

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:52.232 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We watched it on the height
finder first.

00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:55.468 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And it appeared to just
rise in height,

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.237 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and descend at will.

00:08:57.237 --> 00:08:59.906 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We don't have any idea where
they're coming from, or what

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:04.411 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
they are, and it's being
suppressed by our own

00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:05.912 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
government.

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:09.115 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The individual who told us it
was a weather balloon, or told

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:14.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
us it was a missile from White
Sands, had to be an idiot.

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:16.256 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
Total idiot.

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:18.725 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: This former Air Force
officer doesn't want his

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:22.228 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
identity revealed, but recalls
daylight UFOs sightings while

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
stationed in Alaska.

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:28.435 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-They appeared to be disks of
some kind or another, and

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:29.936 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
silver in color.

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:32.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And they were just sitting
there, perfectly stationary.

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:35.642 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
As the jets proceeded to go
after them in different

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:38.678 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
groups, they came back
together again.

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:39.946 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Incredible speed.

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:41.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Just like the blink of an eye.

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:44.617 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Nobody knew what they were,
and they were completely

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:45.985 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
beyond our capability.

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:47.587 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
And we knew--

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
we thought we knew the
capabilities of the

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:50.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Soviets at the time.

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:53.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They didn't have anything better
than a meg either.

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:55.295 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Many people trace the
beginning of the modern

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:59.532 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
UFO era to the June 1947
sighting of nine objects by

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:02.969 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
pilot Kenneth Arnold while
flying over Washington state.

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:05.972 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Arnold compared the flight of
the objects to a saucer

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:09.976 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
skipping across water, and the
term "flying saucer" was born.

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:13.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In reality, sightings had been
taking place for years before

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:14.747 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Arnold's brief encounter.

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:17.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
During the final months of World
War II, air crews on

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:20.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
both sides of the war frequently
encountered

00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
strange, almost playful balls
of light, which came to be

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
known as foo fighters.

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:27.894 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We thought they might be
Nazi secret weapons.

00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:30.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The Germans and Japanese
thought they were ours.

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
After the war, thousands of
so-called ghost rockets were

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
reported over Europe, especially
Scandinavia.

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:39.405 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We suspected they might
be Russian weapons.

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:41.207 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The Russians thought
they were ours.

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:45.011 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
UFOs burst on to the American
scene in 1947.

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:47.447 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Kenneth Arnold's was
one of nearly 900

00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:48.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
sightings that summer.

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:53.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In early 1948, a military pilot,
Captain Thomas Mantell,

00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:55.688 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
chased a UFO over Kentucky.

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:58.925 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Mantell radioed back that the
object was metallic of

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:00.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
tremendous size.

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:04.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
A few minutes later, his plane
crashed, and Mantell was dead.

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:07.567 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The official explanation was
that he was chasing the planet

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:10.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Venus, and blacked out
for a lack of oxygen.

00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
A metallic Venus didn't
wash with many people.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.043 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Former US senator and Air Force
General Howard Cannon

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:19.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
served with Captain Mantell.

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:21.581 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
-He went to altitude, and
he kept trying to go,

00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:22.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
trying to follow it.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He reported in, did report
in what he was

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:28.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
seeing on the radio.

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:33.626 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And eventually, he just
spun out and went in.

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:35.361 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
NARRATOR: On the surface,
all was calm.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.964 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But behind the scenes, military
officials were

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:39.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
greatly concerned.

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:42.068 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They worried that these
unidentified objects might be

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:45.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
advanced weapons from an
enemy nation, so secret

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.573 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
studies were begun.

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:50.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
A joint Army-FBI study concluded
that the objects

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:53.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
were real, not imaginary; that
they appeared to be metallic,

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:58.084 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
disk-shaped manufactured craft
capable of great speeds and

00:11:58.084 --> 00:11:59.452 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
evasive maneuvers.

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:04.524 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The existence of this study was
kept secret until 1976, 29

00:12:04.524 --> 00:12:05.959 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
years later.

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.628 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The Air Force began its own
study centered at Wright

00:12:08.628 --> 00:12:12.465 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Patterson Air Base in Ohio,
and dubbed Project Sign.

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:16.502 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In August of 1948, a top secret
evaluation was written

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:20.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
based on an analysis
of 200 early cases.

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:23.276 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The Project Sign report
concluded astonishingly that

00:12:23.276 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
UFOs were almost certainly
interplanetary craft.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.816 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But when the document was
forwarded to chief of staff

00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:33.319 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Hoyt Vandenberg, the General
disagreed with the conclusion,

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:36.689 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and ordered all copies of
the report destroyed.

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:39.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Vandenberg later confided that
such a conclusion would have,

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
quote, "caused a stampede,"
meaning widespread panic.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.132 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Air Force staffers
got the message--

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:49.135 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
any conclusion that UFOs were
from somewhere else was

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:50.637 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
unacceptable.

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:53.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They rewrote their report,
reached no conclusion, and

00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:55.141 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that report was accepted.

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:58.511 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Despite the inconclusive bottom
line, this report was

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:01.781 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
also kept secret until 1985.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:05.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
That was the last gasp for
objective UFO studies.

00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:08.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Project Sign was renamed
Project Grudge.

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
According to a later
congressional report, the

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:15.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
primary job of Grudge was to
explain all UFO sightings.

00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:18.197 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Even with this mandate, Grudge
staffers still found they

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:22.168 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
could not explain 23%
of UFO incidents.

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:25.171 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Their final report chalked up
these unknown sightings to,

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.874 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
quote, "psychological
explanations"--

00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the first official declaration
that people who see flying

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
saucers are crazy.

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:36.949 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-The government has been aware
since the late '40s at least

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that we are dealing with, in
many cases, solid vehicles not

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.125 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
from this Earth.

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:50.496 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
That they are powered by
extremely advanced propulsion

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:53.933 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
systems, and that
in some cases,

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:55.735 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
occupants have been seen.

00:13:55.735 --> 00:13:58.037 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: The Air Force went to
great lengths to convince

00:13:58.037 --> 00:14:00.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the public there was nothing
to worry about.

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:03.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
When tens of thousands of people
from the Dakotas to

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:07.213 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Mexico witnessed a formation of
bright UFOs, the Pentagon

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:09.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
dismissed it as a
misidentification of the

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:13.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
constellation Orion, even though
at the time, Orion

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
could only have been seen from
the other side of the earth.

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:19.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
When witnesses reported the
apparent landing of a UFO at

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:23.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
White Sands, New Mexico, the Air
Force determined that what

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:26.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
had been seen was the planet
Venus, to which one scoffer

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:29.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
replied, "what an historic
occasion.

00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:33.239 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The night Venus landed on the
gypsum flats of New Mexico."

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:36.776 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The joke making the rounds in
those days was that for every

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:48.254 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
200 UFOs sighted, the Air Force
could explain away 210.

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:50.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Even less cooperative than
the public where the UFOs

00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:52.091 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
themselves.

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:54.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Once again, they seemed
determined to refute all

00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:57.263 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
suggestions that they
didn't exist.

00:14:57.263 --> 00:15:01.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
In 1952, the US was hit by
a massive wave of UFO

00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:02.802 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
sightings--

00:15:02.802 --> 00:15:05.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
more than 1,500 separate
incidents in all.

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:08.174 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And many more occurred that
weren't reported.

00:15:08.174 --> 00:15:11.410 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Those who question why UFOs
haven't landed in Washington,

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.148 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
DC, may be interested in what
may rank as the most dramatic

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
UFO incident of all.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:21.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In July 1952, the nation's
capital was buzzed by at least

00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:24.957 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
six UFOs on two consecutive
weekends.

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:27.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The objects were picked up
on numerous civilian

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and military radars.

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:31.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Fighters were scrambled, but
were unable to get near the

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.199 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
elusive lights.

00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:35.301 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Photos were taken
of the objects.

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:38.404 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Confidential reports hinted the
objects may have been from

00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:42.208 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
other planets, but the public
explanation was the sightings

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:44.944 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
were merely the result of a
temperature inversion--

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a thin excuse which didn't
convince many people,

00:15:47.847 --> 00:15:51.284 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
especially the Pentagon's
own radar operators.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:54.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Even more embarrassing for the
Air Force, the DC incidents

00:15:54.554 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
occurred at the same time
as a major Pentagon news

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:02.562 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
conference, called in order
to formally dismiss UFOs.

00:16:02.562 --> 00:16:07.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-We've been able to explain them
as hoaxes, as erroneously

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:12.071 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
identified friendly aircraft,
as meteorological or

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:16.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
electronic phenomena, or
as light aberrations.

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:19.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: With its public
credibility on the wane, the

00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:21.781 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Air Force launched yet another
so-called study--

00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:24.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Project Blue Book, which was
soon inundated with new

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:26.185 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
sighting reports.

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:28.988 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The first head of Blue Book,
Captain Edward Ruppelt

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:32.291 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
somewhat naively attempted to
conduct an authentic study,

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:35.027 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but quickly surmised that his
superiors didn't really

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:36.462 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
welcome such an effort.

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:39.832 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In disgust, he quit, then wrote
a book which told the

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:43.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
world that a cover-up was in
the works, that UFOs were

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:46.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
real, and that they may be
extraterrestrial craft.

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:48.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Blue Book stumbled on.

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:51.377 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-From the Air Force point of
view, and the government point

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:55.281 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of view, it was primarily a
public relations exercise.

00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:58.184 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
To the Air Force in those
days, UFO reports

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.119 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
were just an annoyance.

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:01.387 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
They were--

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:03.589 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and I asked Hector Quintanilla,
who Major

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:04.924 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
Quintanilla--

00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:06.392 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
who was in charge of Blue
Book at the time.

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:08.461 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And he said, it's not our
job to do research.

00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:10.396 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It's the scientific
community's job.

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:13.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And every time we go to the
scientific community, they see

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:15.401 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
there is nothing to UFOs.

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:20.239 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So who are we to say that the
scientists are wrong?

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:22.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Despite the pretense
of being an objective study,

00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:26.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it became abundantly clear in
later years that Blue Book was

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:29.148 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a public relations exercise,
and that the best, most

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.918 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
intriguing UFO cases
were never included

00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:33.419 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in Blue Book's files.

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:37.723 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
This memo, issued by an Air
Force general in 1969,

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:42.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
confirms that UFO cases, which
affected national security,

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:44.597 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
were set to another program,
one that remains

00:17:44.597 --> 00:17:46.632 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
secret to this day.

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:48.267 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
-So the notion--

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:50.269 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which most people seem to
accept-- that the only group

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:52.638 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
concerned with UFOs is this
wonderful scientific group,

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:55.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Project Blue Book, which
it never was anyway.

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.109 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
It's nonsense.

00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:59.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's clearly enunciated by an
Air Force general told to look

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:01.047 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
over the whole situation.

00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:03.449 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Former Air Force
Colonel Wendelle Stevens was

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:06.552 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
stationed at Wright Patterson
Air Base when the UFOs studies

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:08.387 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
were headquartered there.

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:11.657 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He was assigned to a special
project in Alaska, along with

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a team of civilians, and several
planes packed with

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.698 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
sophisticated electronic and
photographic equipment.

00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-And we succeeded in getting
and collecting information

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.704 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
probably two or three
times a week.

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And some of the cases, of the
contact cases, were quite

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
spectacular.

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:30.543 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
One of the key pictures
I remember was

00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:32.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
a time when a disk--

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:36.482 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
about a 30-foot diameter disk
got in the slot behind the

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:40.019 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
trailing edge of the big wing,
and ahead of the leading edge

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:44.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of the small wing, and only
inside of the wing tips within

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:47.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
50 or 60 feet of the fuselage,
and sat there for

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:48.861 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
two or three minutes.

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.763 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And they took pictures with
all these cameras.

00:18:50.763 --> 00:18:54.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And we would package it in a
metal box, a little locker

00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:56.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that was locked and chained to
an officer's wrist, and flown

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:57.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
to Washington.

00:18:57.503 --> 00:18:59.572 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Every night, we got
one of those.

00:18:59.572 --> 00:19:01.474 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
None of that has ever
been released.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Up next, Journalist
Bryan Gresh investigates the

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.245 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
central event in what some have

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:07.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
called the Cosmic Watergate.

00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:23.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The town of Roswell, New Mexico,
isn't much different

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
today than it was 45 years ago
when it became the unlikely

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.468 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
setting for what
may rank as the

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:31.537 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
greatest cover-up in history.

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:35.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The old Army airfield has been
closed for years, but back in

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:39.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the late '40s, it was home to
the world's only atomic bomber

00:19:39.078 --> 00:19:42.982 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
wing, the 509th, a point of
pride with the locals.

00:19:42.982 --> 00:19:45.551 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Today, as then, much
of New Mexico is a

00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:47.753 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
virtual military fiefdom.

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:50.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Kirtland Air Force Base in
Albuquerque was, and is, the

00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:52.858 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
state's largest employer.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:56.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Los Alamos Lab and White Sands
Missile Base are still key

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:59.532 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
players in the nation's
defense establishment.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:02.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If someone had wanted to get a
clear picture of America's

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:06.072 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
military capabilities back in
the '40s, New Mexico would

00:20:06.072 --> 00:20:08.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
have been the place to be.

00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:21.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
[bomb exploding]

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:24.223 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: New Mexico in the late
'40s and early '50s was

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
not only a hotbed of
military activity,

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:29.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
but also of UFO sightings.

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:32.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Green fireballs and other
unexplained phenomena had been

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:35.601 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
reported over nearly all of
the state's top secret

00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:39.605 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
military facilities on an
ongoing basis, prompting

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:42.274 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
hush-hush studies
and evaluations.

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:45.678 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
One secret study, dubbed Project
Twinkle, concluded

00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:47.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that it was doubtful
the phenomenon

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:49.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
was of natural origin.

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:50.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
One reason--

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:52.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
when attempts were made to
photograph or record the

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:56.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
fireballs, they simply moved
to another location, as if

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
they didn't want their
pictures taken.

00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:01.827 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Twinkle remained classified
for decades.

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:05.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
By early July of '47, the public
was also becoming aware

00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:08.167 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the flying saucer mystery.

00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:10.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Kenneth Arnold's famous sighting
had occurred only a

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:15.207 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
few days before, spurring a
nationwide sighting spree.

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:18.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But what was seen in the skies
over Roswell was different

00:21:18.511 --> 00:21:20.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
from the other elusive lights.

00:21:20.513 --> 00:21:23.682 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
This time, the lights
came crashing down.

00:21:23.682 --> 00:21:26.719 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A rancher named Mack Brazel
was the first to spot the

00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:28.287 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
wreckage in the desert.

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:31.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
He first phoned the sheriff, who
then called the Army Air

00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:34.026 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Base to report that something
had crashed--

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:36.662 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
a decision both would
soon regret.

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:39.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The base dispatched intelligence
officer Major

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:41.500 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Jesse Marcel, to the scene.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Marcel and others gathered up
some of the strange material,

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.006 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and brought it back
to Roswell.

00:21:47.006 --> 00:21:54.680 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-Foil-looking material, about
the thickness, or thinner than

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.849 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the foil on a package
of cigarettes.

00:21:56.849 --> 00:21:59.652 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And that's pretty darn thin.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:02.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Could not be burned,
could not be cut

00:22:02.688 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
with a pair of scissors.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Put on the ground, and a pen
knife taking and trying to

00:22:08.761 --> 00:22:13.265 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
drive it through,
wouldn't work.

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:15.701 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
There's no way-- it was
indestructible for all

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:17.736 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
practical purposes.

00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:20.372 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: Lieutenant Walter Haut
was the public affairs

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:22.274 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
officer for Roswell
at the time the

00:22:22.274 --> 00:22:24.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
strange metal was found.

00:22:24.076 --> 00:22:27.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
He recalls being ordered by base
commander Colonel William

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:30.249 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Blanchard to issue a shocking
press release.

00:22:30.249 --> 00:22:35.354 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
-He called and said words
to this effect--

00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:41.260 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
we've got pieces of what we
think is a flying saucer.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.862 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: The release was picked
up by newspapers all

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:47.499 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
over the world, and queries
about the flying saucer came

00:22:47.499 --> 00:22:48.934 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
pouring in.

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:52.571 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-The first phone call I got
after that got on the wires

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:55.741 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and the like was from
London, England.

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Fella calling, some
newspaper--

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.213 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and I don't remember
which one it was--

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
if this is something from outer
space, how did Major

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.952 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Marcel know how to fly it?

00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:09.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Well, he didn't actually
get in it and fly it.

00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:11.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
He just put the pieces
in an airplane,

00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:12.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and flew the airplane.

00:23:12.925 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NARRATOR: But within hours
after the initial press

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
release, higher ups within
the Army ordered a

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.465 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
new story to be issued.

00:23:19.465 --> 00:23:22.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The wreckage wasn't from a
flying saucer after all, but

00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
rather was part of a
weather balloon.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.307 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
A news conference was staged, at
which pieces of a shredded

00:23:28.307 --> 00:23:30.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
weather balloon were
put on display.

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:34.146 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But Major Marcel admitted in
later years that the material

00:23:34.146 --> 00:23:36.782 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
shown to the reporters wasn't
what he brought back from the

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:38.484 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
Brazel ranch.

00:23:38.484 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Marcel said the metal had been
spread out over three quarters

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.957 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of a mile at the ranch, far
too much material for a

00:23:44.957 --> 00:23:46.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
weather balloon.

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:49.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And, he said, some of the pieces
contained strange,

00:23:49.061 --> 00:23:53.232 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
inscrutable symbols, as if
written in an alien language.

00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:56.835 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
-He reiterated that over
and over, that what he

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:59.972 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
had seen was not--

00:23:59.972 --> 00:24:02.107 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I will have to quote here--

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:10.282 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"not of this earth." he was
very, very adamant about it.

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:12.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NARRATOR: What Haut didn't
know back then was that a

00:24:12.318 --> 00:24:16.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
second wreckage site 120 miles
from the Brazel ranch had also

00:24:16.722 --> 00:24:19.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
been found, and on
the same day.

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:22.828 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Numerous witnesses, including an
archaeology team, say they

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:26.832 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
saw a large crashed disk, and
the bodies of at least four

00:24:26.832 --> 00:24:28.334 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
alien creatures.

00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Like the Brazel site, this
second location was sealed off

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.939 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
by the military, and witnesses
were told to keep

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:35.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
their mouths shut.

00:24:35.374 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
-So when you get such a
consistency of input from

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
respectable people, people whose
testimonies you'd like

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:44.183 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
on your side in a court law--
ask any attorney--

00:24:44.183 --> 00:24:45.250 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
you're stuck.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:46.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
What are you gonna
do from there?

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:47.786 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
These people are telling
the truth.

00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's not one person.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.521 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It's not 10 people.

00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:51.623 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's over a hundred people.

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
As Friedman reveals in his
book, "Crash at Corona,"

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.863 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
dozens of former military
personnel have surfaced over

00:24:57.863 --> 00:25:01.867 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the years who say they saw,
handled, or transported either

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:05.571 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the wreckage, the alien
bodies, or both.

00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:08.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Bob Shirkey, the former
assistant operations officer

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:11.543 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
at Roswell Field,
is one of them.

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:14.012 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Colonel Blanchard had called
down and said, set up a plane

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:15.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to go to Fort Worth.

00:25:15.147 --> 00:25:16.782 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And he said, I want a B-29.

00:25:16.782 --> 00:25:21.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then, Colonel Blanchard
showed up in a couple of cars,

00:25:21.887 --> 00:25:25.157 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and people come hurrying
into the building.

00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:27.893 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And he stepped in--

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:29.895 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Colonel Blanchard stepped into
this doorway, into the

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:33.899 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
operations office, to get
out of the hallway.

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:36.769 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And that's when I said, Colonel
Blanchard, you're

00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:37.703 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
blocking my view, you know.

00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:38.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
[chuckles]

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:41.907 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But I peeked over your shoulder
as a couple people

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:45.644 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
went by, carrying various
pieces of metal.

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:49.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And one them a pretty good
size, about two by four.

00:25:49.348 --> 00:25:51.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Shirkey says he knew
other people who had knowledge

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:55.154 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the wreckage or bodies,
including a nurse at the base

00:25:55.154 --> 00:25:59.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
hospital who claimed to have
seen horrid alien carcasses.

00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:02.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Shirkey has also remained
friends with the Glenn Dennis,

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:03.929 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the town mortician.

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:06.865 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-He said to me, did you see the
sketches in the paper of

00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:09.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the humanoids or the bodies?

00:26:09.168 --> 00:26:10.803 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
I said, yes.

00:26:10.803 --> 00:26:14.206 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He says, well, I can tell you
that's what they look like.

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:22.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Said our funeral parlor supplied
the caskets for the

00:26:22.648 --> 00:26:26.552 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Air Force to use, because
we had the contract.

00:26:26.552 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And they came in and took all
the baby-size or youth-sized

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.225 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
caskets we had.

00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:36.528 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-When this crashed saucer event
took place, the military

00:26:36.528 --> 00:26:40.299 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
told them, if you ever talk
about what you saw, we will

00:26:40.299 --> 00:26:43.969 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
kill you, and we will
kill your family.

00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:46.472 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: While a cover story
was being spoon-fed to

00:26:46.472 --> 00:26:49.975 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
gullible media, more dramatic
steps were taken to ensure

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:51.977 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that the story of the
saucer and bodies

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:53.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
would spread no further.

00:26:53.879 --> 00:26:57.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Mack Brazel, for instance, was
held incommunicado for a week.

00:26:57.616 --> 00:27:00.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And when he finally reemerged,
had changed his story about

00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:01.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
what he found.

00:27:01.987 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Sheriff George Wilcox confided
in later years that the lives

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.227 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of his family had been
threatened by the military,

00:27:08.227 --> 00:27:10.996 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
unless he kept out of
the investigation.

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:14.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
His own samples of the strange
metal were seized.

00:27:14.333 --> 00:27:18.003 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A Roswell radio station was
ordered by the FBI to cease

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:20.005 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
transmission of a story
about the crash.

00:27:24.877 --> 00:27:27.012 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But the most effective
subterfuge involved the

00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:30.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
transport of the alleged
alien flotsam.

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:33.018 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Witnesses and records indicate
that some of the material was

00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:36.021 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
immediately flown to Fort
Worth, then onto Wright

00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:40.092 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Patterson Air Base in Ohio, and
perhaps to Washington, DC.

00:27:40.092 --> 00:27:43.028 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The official army story is that
once the weather balloon

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:46.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
mix-up was discovered, plans for
transporting the material

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:48.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
were canceled altogether--

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:50.569 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a statement that is demonstrably
false.

00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:54.039 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Pilots who flew the material out
of Roswell have confirmed

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:56.041 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the army was lying.

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:58.043 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
One pilot even claimed to
have seen the alien

00:27:58.043 --> 00:28:00.245 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
bodies while in flight.

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:05.050 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This official FBI memo, dated
July 8, 1947, clearly

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
indicates that a, quote, "disk
was being transported from

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.757 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Roswell to Wright Patterson
by a special plane for

00:28:11.757 --> 00:28:15.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
examination." Wendelle Stevens
was at Wright Patterson back

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
then, and remembers far more
furor than should have been

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
generated by a weather
balloon.

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:24.469 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-My immediate superior, who was
Colonel Albert Boyd, at

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:27.072 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the time, later became
three-star General Albert

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:29.207 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Boyd, and the commander of the
Edwards Air Force Base flight

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:30.876 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
test center.

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:34.146 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He was my immediate superior,
and he was one of the officers

00:28:34.146 --> 00:28:40.018 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that flew General Twining out to
Kirtland Air Force Base on

00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:42.087 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the night of the 3rd of July.

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:44.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: More than 200
witnesses in all have now come

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:47.292 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
forward with bits and pieces of
information about the New

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:51.096 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Mexico events, much of it
first-hand information.

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:53.632 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Yet the official files of those
agencies charged with

00:28:53.632 --> 00:28:56.935 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
investigating UFOs over the
years contain virtually

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:58.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
nothing about the case--

00:28:58.637 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
not even files which
might discredit it.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.542 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
There is more than enough
evidence to suggest that

00:29:03.542 --> 00:29:06.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
something extraordinary happened
in the New Mexican

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:09.848 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
desert back in 1947, and that
the military went to great

00:29:09.848 --> 00:29:11.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
lengths to hide the truth.

00:29:11.984 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-We have the General who took
the call from Washington

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.622 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
saying to cover it up.

00:29:16.622 --> 00:29:20.125 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We have the rancher, his son,
the people around them--

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:22.894 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
neighbors that he talked to--
they come up with a consistent

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:27.132 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
story, descriptions of not only
the wreckage, but how he

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:29.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
was treated by the government.

00:29:29.034 --> 00:29:31.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We have the media people
in the town of Roswell.

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:33.338 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Some of them are still alive.

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:36.041 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We have the guy who put
out the press release.

00:29:36.041 --> 00:29:38.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He's never changed his story
in the 14 years since I've

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:40.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
been talking to Walter Haut.

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:43.582 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
We have the FBI memo.

00:29:43.582 --> 00:29:46.151 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Even more unsettling
is the possibility that there

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
have been other crashes
and other cover-ups.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.157 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
UPS UFO researcher Linda Howe
says she has been shown

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:55.160 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
documents by military officials
which refer to

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
several saucer crashes
and recoveries.

00:29:57.996 --> 00:30:00.999 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Bill Moore, who co-authored the
first book on the Roswell

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:04.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
affair, says he has been shown
similar documents.

00:30:04.403 --> 00:30:07.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And Timothy Good has heard
credible testimony from some

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:10.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of the best known military
leaders of this center.

00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:12.611 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-General George Marshall was
supposed to have something to

00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:14.146 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
do with it.

00:30:14.146 --> 00:30:16.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Marshall became quite
forthcoming, and admitted that

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:20.519 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
there had been contact with
UFOs, and that there had been

00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
at least three crashes, and
occupants had been recovered.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:31.096 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And he went on to say that the
occupants of UFOs were hoping

00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:34.332 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to eventually adapt
to the atmospheric

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:36.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
conditions on this planet.

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:38.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: If there have been
crashes and recoveries, if

00:30:38.904 --> 00:30:41.206 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
alien wreckage and even
bodies have been

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:43.375 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
found, where are they?

00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:45.477 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
What's being done
with the proof?

00:30:45.477 --> 00:30:48.080 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And why can't the
public be told?

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
More on these topics
is still ahead.

00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:02.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-With all due respect to the Air
Force, and I believe that

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.263 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
some of them will prove to be
of interplanetary origin.

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:08.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Retired Marine Corps
officer Donald Keyhoe is

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:11.937 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
widely regarded as the father
of the UFO cover-up theory.

00:31:11.937 --> 00:31:14.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In books, magazines, and
broadcast appearances during

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.276 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the '50s and '60s, the
bulldogish Keyhoe became the

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:21.947 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
single-most painful dagger in
the belly of the Air Force.

00:31:21.947 --> 00:31:25.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
A relentless crusader who relied
on his own military

00:31:25.117 --> 00:31:29.254 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
sources to expose Pentagon lies
about UFOs, and there

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:30.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
were plenty.

00:31:30.756 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-They are simply following
orders to explain away all UFO

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
sightings as quickly as possible
when they become

00:31:38.163 --> 00:31:42.868 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
public, and deny that
UFOs really exist.

00:31:42.868 --> 00:31:45.537 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: The Air Force went to
such extremes in trying to

00:31:45.537 --> 00:31:49.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
explain away UFOs that it lost
credibility, even with

00:31:49.007 --> 00:31:50.275 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
sympathetic media.

00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:54.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In the mid 1960s, the US was
engulfed in an intensive

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
two-year UFO wave during which
hundreds of thousands of

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.786 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Americans claim to
have seen UFOs.

00:32:00.786 --> 00:32:04.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Allen Hynek, Project Blue Book's
designated explainer

00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:07.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
inadvertently punctuated the
mid '60s flap when he

00:32:07.526 --> 00:32:10.495 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
announced that UFO sightings
by hundreds of Michigan

00:32:10.495 --> 00:32:14.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
residents were inspired by swamp
gas, an excuse which was

00:32:14.566 --> 00:32:17.536 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
ridiculed nationally, and which
prompted calls for a

00:32:17.536 --> 00:32:19.404 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
congressional inquiry
into UFOs.

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:26.311 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Under pressure, the Air Force
agreed to sponsor what it

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:29.848 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
called an independent scientific
study of UFOs.

00:32:29.848 --> 00:32:33.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Several universities declined
the job, which eventually went

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:35.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to esteemed University
of Colorado

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:37.823 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
physicist Dr. Edward Condon.

00:32:37.823 --> 00:32:41.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But any hopes for an objective
study were dashed even before

00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:42.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the project began.

00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:45.497 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Condon himself stated in public
that the government

00:32:45.497 --> 00:32:48.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
should get out of the UFO
business, and that UFO writers

00:32:48.834 --> 00:32:50.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
should be horse-whipped.

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:53.505 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
His project coordinator caused
his own stir when one of his

00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:56.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
memos was leaked, stating that
the staff would consist of

00:32:56.975 --> 00:33:00.178 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
non-believers, and that the,
quote, "trick would be to make

00:33:00.178 --> 00:33:03.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the study appear objective."
Several staff members

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:06.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
resigned, complaining that
the results were rigged.

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:09.554 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Nevertheless, the Condon report
predictably concluded

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:11.923 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that UFOs weren't
worth studying.

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:14.759 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And the Air Force used the
Condon report as a reason to

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:18.363 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
cancel Blue Book altogether
in 1969.

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:21.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-None of the evidence that I
have examined would indicate

00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
any proof at all that we
are being visited by

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
extraterrestrials.

00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:30.375 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
-We have not been
hiding anything.

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:33.879 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The investigations have
been made public.

00:33:33.879 --> 00:33:37.415 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The explanations of those
where there is a queer

00:33:37.415 --> 00:33:39.584 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
explanation have been
made public.

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:41.987 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: Hynek, of course,
would soon change his mind

00:33:41.987 --> 00:33:45.223 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
about Blue Book, and about UFOs,
and would become the

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:48.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
most important figure in the
history of American ufology.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Jacques Vallee was his
closest associate.

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:54.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-The Scientific Advisory Board
of the US Air Force had many

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:57.402 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
opportunities to review
the UFO finds.

00:33:57.402 --> 00:34:01.106 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They knew that people liked
Dr. Hynek and I, and many

00:34:01.106 --> 00:34:03.842 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
other scientists were
of the opinion that

00:34:03.842 --> 00:34:05.110 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
this should be studied.

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.411 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And they could have
done something.

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:10.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And if they had given an opinion
to the secretary of

00:34:10.582 --> 00:34:12.150 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the Air Force that this
should be studied, it

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.585 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
would have been studied.

00:34:13.585 --> 00:34:16.321 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Instead, everything was
swept under the rug.

00:34:16.321 --> 00:34:18.523 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: The Air Force
contention that UFOs were not

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:22.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a threat to national security
was contradicted over and over

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:24.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
by the military's own files.

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:28.466 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
A secret order issued in 1960
to all Air Force commanders

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:31.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
stated flat out that the
Pentagon considers UFOs,

00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:35.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
quote, "serious business,"
and no wonder.

00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:38.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
UFOs have been seen most often
over sensitive nuclear and

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:41.613 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
military installations,
including Oak Ridge National

00:34:41.613 --> 00:34:46.284 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Lab, Los Alamos, White Sands,
Savannah River, and dozens of

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:48.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
other defense installations.

00:34:48.453 --> 00:34:50.455 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Anybody would recognize that
if you have a base at which

00:34:50.455 --> 00:34:53.458 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
there are stored nuclear
weapons, and a vehicle has

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:56.494 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
penetrated your air cover, and
goes right down the runway,

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:58.763 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that has national security
implications.

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:01.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
That kind of sighting is far
more interesting to me than

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:03.935 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
some light in the sky
meandering along.

00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:07.305 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So one on one hand, we have
this popular impression--

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:09.774 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
repeated as recently as a few
months ago by an Air Force

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.409 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
spokesman--

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:13.678 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that there isn't anything that
affects national security, and

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:15.447 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Blue Book was it.

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:17.315 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Well, that's absolute
nonsense.

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:20.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And we've had the records to
prove that for a long time.

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:22.620 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: One indication of the
Air Force's true view of

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:26.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
UFOs was found in this chapter
from a military textbook being

00:35:26.491 --> 00:35:29.561 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
used at the Air Force Academy
in the late '60s.

00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:33.231 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The Air Force was teaching its
finest cadets that the UFO

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:37.268 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
phenomenon has been global in
nature for 50,000 years, that

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:41.306 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it is not psychological, that
some UFOs appear to be craft

00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:44.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
controlled by aliens, and that
there may be as many as four

00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:46.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
types of aliens visiting
this planet--

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:49.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the Air Force's own words.

00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:51.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
When word of this chapter leaked
to the public, it was

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:53.551 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
pulled from the curriculum.

00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:56.988 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Another indication of how
seriously UFOs were taken was

00:35:56.988 --> 00:36:00.025 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the level of secrecy assigned
by the Pentagon.

00:36:00.025 --> 00:36:01.226 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-And it has been covered up.

00:36:01.226 --> 00:36:03.028 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It was classified higher
than the hydrogen

00:36:03.028 --> 00:36:05.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
bomb back in 1950.

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:08.867 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And it's still classified way,
way above top secret.

00:36:08.867 --> 00:36:11.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: One source for this
information was Wilbert Smith,

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:14.873 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
one of Canada's leading
scientists during the 1950s.

00:36:14.873 --> 00:36:18.076 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In this formerly top secret
memo written for Canada's

00:36:18.076 --> 00:36:21.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Department of Transport, Smith
revealed that he had high

00:36:21.446 --> 00:36:24.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
level meetings with American
scientists concerning UFOs,

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:28.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that flying saucers were real,
and that they were classified

00:36:28.253 --> 00:36:30.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
higher than the H-bomb
in the US.

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:33.725 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Smith also indicated that
material from crashed saucers

00:36:33.725 --> 00:36:35.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
had been recovered
by the Americans.

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:40.765 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
One of Smith's American contacts
was the late Dr.

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:44.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Robert Sarbacher one of the most
respected scientists of

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:46.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
this century, and a contemporary
of Einstein and

00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:48.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
Oppenheimer.

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:50.475 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In letters and personal
interviews from the early

00:36:50.475 --> 00:36:54.112 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
'80s, Sarbacher conceded that
he had told Wilbert Smith

00:36:54.112 --> 00:36:57.415 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
about recovered saucers and
alien bodies, things which,

00:36:57.415 --> 00:37:00.785 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
quote, "didn't originate on
Earth." Sarbacher says he was

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:03.822 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
invited to work on these
materials, but never did.

00:37:03.822 --> 00:37:06.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He also named several other
scientists whom he said were

00:37:06.925 --> 00:37:08.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
definitely involved.

00:37:08.493 --> 00:37:11.096 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Said he'd received briefings on
the topic while working at

00:37:11.096 --> 00:37:13.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the Pentagon, and that the
entire matter was the most

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:16.634 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
classified subject in
the US government.

00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:19.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Because of Sarbacher's
scientific stature, many

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:21.773 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
researchers consider his
statements to be the most

00:37:21.773 --> 00:37:24.843 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
significant ever made
on the UFO topic.

00:37:24.843 --> 00:37:27.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The Canadian government wasn't
the only one to learn about

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:29.347 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
America's saucer secrets.

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:32.917 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Former NATO staffer Robert Dean
says he read a top secret

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:36.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
briefing document prepared
for American allies.

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:38.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-The conclusion of the study
was that if there was a

00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:42.627 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
program or a hostile purpose
here, it'd have all been over.

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:44.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They could fly rings
around us.

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:46.698 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
They made fools of
us in the air.

00:37:46.698 --> 00:37:49.467 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
They played games with
us on the ground.

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:51.336 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Case after case after case.

00:37:51.336 --> 00:37:54.639 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-There is a collaboration on
top-- about top secret

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:56.808 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
information on this subject
between, say, the United

00:37:56.808 --> 00:38:00.411 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
States, Great Britain to a
certain extent, to a certain

00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:04.849 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
extent Canada, Australia.

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:06.784 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
But this is to a
limited extent.

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:10.889 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I don't think the United States
has revealed everything

00:38:10.889 --> 00:38:12.991 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it knows to other governments.

00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:14.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I'm convinced of that.

00:38:14.893 --> 00:38:18.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Many governments haven't the
faintest idea what's going on.

00:38:18.563 --> 00:38:22.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They have no need to know, and
they haven't been filled in.

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:24.235 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
NARRATOR: Why would world
governments maintain two

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:25.970 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
attitudes about UFOs--

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.673 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a great concern in private,
but ridicule and

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:30.241 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
debunking in public?

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:34.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The answer can be traced
to the early '50s.

00:38:34.345 --> 00:38:36.147 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-What is the flying saucer?

00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:38.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
What do people see and
sometimes photograph?

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:41.686 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
What's behind the daily reports
of aerial phenomena in

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:43.121 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the nation's press?

00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:46.691 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-I think it was from outer
space, but friendly.

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:50.028 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: The great UFO wave
of 1952 had attracted the

00:38:50.028 --> 00:38:53.198 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
attention of the CIA, which was
concerned that a foreign

00:38:53.198 --> 00:38:56.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
power might be able to exploit
America's saucer craze.

00:38:56.701 --> 00:39:00.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So a panel of scientists was
convened to consider UFOs--

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.540 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the so-called Robertson Panel.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Members spent a total of 12
hours over three days

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
reviewing the UFO evidence,
and concluded there was

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.048 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
nothing to worry about.

00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:13.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
UFOs were not a threat
to national security.

00:39:13.051 --> 00:39:15.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
However, the continued reporting
of UFOs could be a

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:19.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
threat, the panel said, and it
recommended an official policy

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.694 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of debunking so that flying
saucers would be stripped of

00:39:22.694 --> 00:39:24.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
their aura of mystery.

00:39:24.329 --> 00:39:27.398 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The Robertson Panel also
recommended that UFO groups

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:29.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and researchers should
be monitored.

00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Armed with these
recommendations, the CIA and

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.773 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
military intelligence agencies
swung into action with a plan

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.742 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that is still being
carried out--

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:41.746 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
ridicule those who see UFOs,
spy on people who research

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:45.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
UFOs, confuse the public
with disinformation.

00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:48.186 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
For example, plans were drafted
to enlist the aid of

00:39:48.186 --> 00:39:51.322 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Walt Disney in belittling
the UFO mystery.

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:55.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Popular TV host Arthur Godfrey
was also to be recruited.

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:58.896 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
CIA staffers so thoroughly
infiltrated the leading UFO

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:01.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
organizations of the day
that most of them

00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:02.934 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
collapsed from within.

00:40:02.934 --> 00:40:06.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Attempts were made in the US and
other countries to build

00:40:06.004 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
terrestrial flying saucers,
which-- if any of them had

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
really worked-- would have
further confused the public.

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:14.312 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-You know, there are lots of
games being played behind the

00:40:14.312 --> 00:40:15.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
phenomenon itself.

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:18.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In other words, there is
a real phenomenon,

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:19.517 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that there may be--

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:21.185 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and here, we're talking about
the third level, the

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:23.621 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
sociological level.

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:27.458 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If you could make people expect
aliens, you could

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:29.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
manipulate public opinion.

00:40:29.294 --> 00:40:32.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: High profile people
who take an interest in UFOs--

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:35.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
people like former Nashville
Councilman George Darden--

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:37.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
end up as targets of
scorn and laughter.

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:40.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Others, like Linda Howe and Bill
Moore, find themselves

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the targets of government
surveillance.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.810 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The FBI, for instance, has been
unwilling to let Moore

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:49.614 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
see the dossier it's compiled
on his UFO activities.

00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:51.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And some have been warned.

00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:55.820 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-I have been warned by some
people that they're paying

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.121 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
close attention to you, Stan.

00:40:57.121 --> 00:41:00.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I try to be careful what
I do, and what I say.

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:02.126 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-And a lot of people have
spilled the beans, but they

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:05.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
have been either popularly
discredited so the story

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:06.831 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
doesn't travel.

00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:11.069 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Some have been incarcerated
in one way or another--

00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:13.938 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
some in mental institutions.

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:15.940 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Nobody else believes that
this is going on.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.108 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They could tell their neighbors
and their neighbors

00:41:17.108 --> 00:41:18.443 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
will laugh at them.

00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:21.012 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But it is going on,
and it works.

00:41:21.012 --> 00:41:24.716 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And there's only a few
that jump the fence.

00:41:24.716 --> 00:41:27.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And those few are discredited,
and the word

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:28.920 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
doesn't travel too far.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.588 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
-Concerning UFOs--

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:33.391 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Clifford Stone had a
spotless military record until

00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:36.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the summer of 1986, when his
army commanders found out he

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:39.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
was writing a book about UFOs.

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:41.866 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
From that point on, Stone
says, his life

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:43.634 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
became a living nightmare.

00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:46.871 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-If you have an interest in
UFOs, and you're writing

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:50.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Freedom of Information Act
requests and writing various

00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:54.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
senators, then there has to be
something wrong with you.

00:41:54.579 --> 00:41:57.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So they set me up for a mental
health evaluation.

00:41:57.281 --> 00:42:02.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Upon my return from seeing
a legal adviser, they had

00:42:02.053 --> 00:42:04.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
already moved everything
out of my office.

00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:06.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I had been relieved of duty.

00:42:06.424 --> 00:42:09.394 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
They set up an office for
me down in the basement.

00:42:09.394 --> 00:42:13.765 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I was not to have any contact
with any of the either cadre.

00:42:13.765 --> 00:42:15.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
As a matter of fact, the other
cadre were scared that if they

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.637 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
were seen talking to me, that
they would be in trouble.

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:21.372 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
They were talking
court martial.

00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:23.608 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Stone says he
developed several high-level

00:42:23.608 --> 00:42:27.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
military sources who convinced
him the cover-up is real.

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:29.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
-My consecutive officer,
who started all of

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:31.349 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
this, called me in.

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:35.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He told me-- he says, what
difference does it make to you

00:42:35.153 --> 00:42:40.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
if we have 50 captured
saucers?

00:42:40.792 --> 00:42:41.592 align:middle line:79% position:49% size:8%
I--

00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:43.428 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
my response to him was--

00:42:43.428 --> 00:42:45.663 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and I remember this
to this day--

00:42:45.663 --> 00:42:49.167 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
sir, you have the luxury of
not knowing the truth.

00:42:49.167 --> 00:42:52.770 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Unfortunately, I do not share
that same luxury.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: People with far more
clout than Cliff Stone have

00:42:55.106 --> 00:42:57.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
also been thwarted in their
efforts to find out what the

00:42:57.942 --> 00:43:00.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
military knows about UFOs.

00:43:00.111 --> 00:43:03.047 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
During his campaign for
president, Jimmy Carter vowed

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:06.217 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to open all UFO files
if he were elected.

00:43:06.217 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
News articles hinted that Carter
was preparing to make

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
an unsettling announcement
about UFOs,

00:43:11.656 --> 00:43:12.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but it never happened.

00:43:12.924 --> 00:43:15.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And to this day, he declines
to say why.

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:18.963 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Senator Barry Goldwater, a
former Air Force General who

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:21.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
also served as Chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee,

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:25.002 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
would presumably have the power
and the clearance to see

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:26.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
anything in the military's
arsenal.

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:30.007 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But when Goldwater asked to see
the so-called blue room,

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:32.844 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
where UFO material is
supposedly stored--

00:43:32.844 --> 00:43:35.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
during a visit to Wright
Patterson Air Base in Ohio, he

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
was told by General Curtis LeMay
that it was none of his

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:41.686 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
business, and that he should
never ask again.

00:43:41.686 --> 00:43:44.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Former Nevada Senator Howard
Cannon is one of Goldwater's

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:48.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
closest friends, and says he and
Goldwater discussed UFOs

00:43:48.493 --> 00:43:50.962 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and the blue room
several times.

00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:54.499 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
-What Barry wanted to do
is get in and find out,

00:43:54.499 --> 00:43:57.001 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
what did they have?

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:58.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
What could they say?

00:43:58.636 --> 00:44:02.340 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
When he say he was turned down,
I'm sure that had I gone

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.009 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to them and said, I'd
like to go in there.

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:07.011 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What's the useful purpose?

00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:10.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You know, we couldn't come out
and talk about that sort of

00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:14.752 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
thing, and say, well,
here's what we saw.

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:17.722 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
First place, somebody'd
say we're lying.

00:44:17.722 --> 00:44:22.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And it would serve no useful
purpose, I think.

00:44:22.293 --> 00:44:25.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Cannon, who also was
an Air Force General, thinks

00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:28.032 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Congress would have been told
if crashed saucers had ever

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:31.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
been recovered, but concedes
that such secrets could be

00:44:31.302 --> 00:44:33.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
kept from Congress
and the public.

00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:36.607 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-Well, they've kept some pretty
good secrets over a

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:37.608 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
period of time.

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:41.379 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And so I'd have to say that--

00:44:41.379 --> 00:44:44.515 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I'd have to believe
that secrets like

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:47.051 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that could be kept.

00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:49.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Getting copies of
government UFO documents can

00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:52.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
also be a daunting task in
spite of the Freedom of

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:54.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Information Act.

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:56.394 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Simply put, if the government
doesn't want you to see a

00:44:56.394 --> 00:44:58.029 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
file, you won't.

00:44:58.029 --> 00:45:00.064 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-There's no question that
agencies in the United States

00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:03.067 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
government have been withholding
on a regular,

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:06.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
clear-cut basis a data about
flying saucers-- among them,

00:45:06.404 --> 00:45:09.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the CIA and the National
Security Agency.

00:45:09.407 --> 00:45:16.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
-Today, 99.9% of all UFO
government documents are

00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:19.317 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
available in the National
Archives.

00:45:19.317 --> 00:45:22.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: UFO debunkers like
Phil Klass somewhat naively

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:25.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
assume that the government has
no interest in hiding UFO

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:27.625 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
files because there's
nothing in them.

00:45:27.625 --> 00:45:30.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
That view is not borne
out by experience.

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:33.297 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The FBI, for instance,
vigorously and repeatedly

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:37.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
denied having any UFO files or
any interest in the subject.

00:45:37.635 --> 00:45:40.104 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But when the Freedom of
Information Act was passed,

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:44.108 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the G-men reluctantly coughed
up 2,000 pages of UFO

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:46.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
documents, dating back
to the very beginning

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of the modern UFO.

00:45:48.346 --> 00:45:51.983 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Write to the CIA to ask for its
UFO files, and you'll be

00:45:51.983 --> 00:45:55.019 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
told the agency hasn't collected
UFO information

00:45:55.019 --> 00:45:56.187 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
since the '50s.

00:45:56.187 --> 00:46:00.024 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Yet official documents from the
'70s and beyond refer to

00:46:00.024 --> 00:46:04.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
CIA UFO experts, CIA UFO
studies, and the CIA

00:46:04.996 --> 00:46:07.164 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
monitoring the UFO situation.

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:11.135 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Military officials have also
been caught telling UFO lies.

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:14.138 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Both the Air Force and the RAND
Corporation denied any

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.874 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
knowledge of a secret UFO study
commissioned by the

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:18.976 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Pentagon, yet there it is.

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:22.380 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The RAND study acknowledged the
reality of UFOs, and said

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.549 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that a solution to the UFO
mystery was a matter of the

00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:27.151 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
highest urgency.

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:29.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-The National Security Agency,
the CIA, Defense Intelligence

00:46:29.854 --> 00:46:34.792 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Agency, FBI, and many other
agencies are withholding

00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:37.461 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
thousands of pages of documents
on UFOs in the

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:39.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
interest of national security.

00:46:39.163 --> 00:46:40.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
They admit that.

00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:44.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
For decades now since the 1940s,
all those agencies I

00:46:44.702 --> 00:46:48.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
just referred to have denied
any sort of serious

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:50.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
involvement in UFO research.

00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:52.209 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So they've been lying
to us about that.

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:55.179 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: In addition to lying
about the existence of UFO

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:58.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
documents, government agencies
routinely censor those UFO

00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:01.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
files which they are
forced to release.

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:04.221 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-The trouble is, as you start
to go through this document,

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:08.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
you rather quickly find that a
lot of it isn't really there.

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:15.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And I won't stop, because you'll
see how many pages are

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:18.202 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
really full of good
information.

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:20.971 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Trying to get files
declassified can be all but

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:22.206 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
impossible.

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:25.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Appeals to the FBI, for example,
can drag on for three

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:26.577 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
to four years.

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:29.046 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The Department of Energy says
it could take up to seven

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:30.281 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
years to obtain some of its

00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:33.017 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
sensitive UFO-related material.

00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:37.088 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The National Archives has
a backlog of 325 million

00:47:37.088 --> 00:47:39.824 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
documents awaiting
declassification.

00:47:39.824 --> 00:47:43.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Agencies are able to hide behind
this logjam, using it

00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:46.230 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
as an excuse to withhold or
stall the release of UFO

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.465 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
information.

00:47:52.937 --> 00:47:55.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
More disturbing than censorship,
false denials, and

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:57.908 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
stall tactics is
government-sanctioned

00:47:57.908 --> 00:48:00.411 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
disinformation, which seemingly
flows back to the

00:48:00.411 --> 00:48:02.480 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
CIA's Robertson Panel.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:06.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
A recommendation that UFOs
be demystified inspired

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
intelligence agencies to muddy
the flying saucer waters.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.790 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Today, there are even officially
published rules for

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:15.626 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
how a deception program should
be carried out in order to

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:19.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
provide cover stories for secret
military projects.

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:24.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-Disinformation is a diversion
away from the truth.

00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:30.174 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Our method of protecting
information is essentially to

00:48:30.174 --> 00:48:34.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
dilute it with so much garbage
that it is extremely difficult

00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:37.148 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
for an outsider without
access to know what's

00:48:37.148 --> 00:48:38.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
good and what isn't.

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:40.284 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: Bill Moore should
know all about

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:41.685 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
disinformation efforts.

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:45.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He admits that he was part of
one in the 1980s, working hand

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:47.758 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in hand with Air Force
Intelligence in a scheme to

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:49.960 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
discredit a UFO researcher--

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:52.863 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a man who subsequently suffered
a mental breakdown.

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:54.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Moore defends his motives.

00:48:54.832 --> 00:49:00.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-My involvement was only with
the motive of learning how the

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.306 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
process worked.

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:04.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Who is involved with it?

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:08.312 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And ultimately, if I could,
what was behind it?

00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:13.317 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Why is the government doing
this kind of thing?

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:17.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I never did quite learn why,
but I did learn who, and I

00:49:17.888 --> 00:49:20.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
learned a great deal
about how.

00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:22.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Moore is also at the
center of what many consider

00:49:22.393 --> 00:49:24.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to be the ultimate
UFO deception--

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:26.697 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
the MJ-12 affair.

00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:30.367 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
A copy of the so-called MJ-12
document was sent anonymously

00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:32.169 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to Bill Moore's associate.

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:35.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It purports to be a briefing
paper prepared for President

00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:38.342 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Eisenhower, explaining that
crashed saucers and alien

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:41.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
bodies had been recovered, and
that a secret organization of

00:49:41.612 --> 00:49:44.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a dozen scientists and officials
had been appointed

00:49:44.348 --> 00:49:47.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to study and control
all UFO material--

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:48.786 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:16%
MJ-12.

00:49:48.786 --> 00:49:51.522 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Most UFO researchers
consider the MJ-12

00:49:51.522 --> 00:49:52.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
document to be a fake.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.793 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The Air Force has finally issued
a formal statement,

00:49:55.793 --> 00:49:58.095 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
saying the document
is not genuine.

00:49:58.095 --> 00:50:00.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
However, the details
inside the paper

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.366 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
aren't so easily dismissed.

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:04.735 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-More than 30 different pieces
of information--

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:07.872 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
little details that we didn't
know before we got the

00:50:07.872 --> 00:50:11.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
documents, which were received
in December 1984.

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:14.111 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But it turned out to be true.

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:16.447 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And it really boggles the mind
how somebody could have known

00:50:16.447 --> 00:50:17.915 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
those things.

00:50:17.915 --> 00:50:21.452 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-If they're real, then they
speak for themselves.

00:50:21.452 --> 00:50:26.824 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If they're not real, then they
are an extremely elaborate and

00:50:26.824 --> 00:50:31.395 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
sophisticated hoax, which in my
opinion, can only have been

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:34.398 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
created by someone inside the
government, because there are

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:36.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
things in those documents that
weren't in the public domain

00:50:36.901 --> 00:50:39.536 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
at the time the documents
came to us.

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:41.405 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Stan Friedman spent
several months and thousands

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:44.408 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of dollars trying to verify
the MJ-12 paper.

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:47.411 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He says he found nothing which
would automatically discredit

00:50:47.411 --> 00:50:51.215 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it, and remains convinced that
MJ-12, or something like it,

00:50:51.215 --> 00:50:52.750 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
is very real.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.952 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
-But I'm convinced that
there is such a group.

00:50:54.952 --> 00:50:57.421 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And if there isn't, then we've
made a terrible mistake,

00:50:57.421 --> 00:51:00.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
because Presidents and
intelligence agents need a

00:51:00.491 --> 00:51:02.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
group like that.

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:04.495 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Jacques Vallee was
one of the first writers to

00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:07.298 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
suggest that the government
might be deeply involved in

00:51:07.298 --> 00:51:09.099 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
UFO disinformation.

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:11.435 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Today, he says, there is
ample evidence that

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:13.103 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
such programs continue.

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:16.006 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-What intrigued me was that
those people had links to

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:20.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
psychological warfare activities
of the military,

00:51:20.244 --> 00:51:24.448 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which opens the way to the
speculation that perhaps the

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:27.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
belief in UFOs can be
manipulated as part of

00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:30.321 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
psychological warfare
exercises.

00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:33.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: The long and winding
paper trail clearly shows that

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:36.527 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
our government in its various
forms spies on UFO

00:51:36.527 --> 00:51:41.165 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
researchers, infiltrates UFO
groups, lies about you UFO

00:51:41.165 --> 00:51:46.136 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
documents, censors UFO files,
threatens UFO witnesses, and

00:51:46.136 --> 00:51:50.174 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
weaves vast and elaborate UFO
deception programs aimed at

00:51:50.174 --> 00:51:53.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
confusing and misleading the
American public and the rest

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.478 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
of the world.

00:51:54.478 --> 00:51:56.347 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The government is acting, in
the view of many, like a

00:51:56.347 --> 00:51:59.383 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
frightened child afraid
to face the truth.

00:51:59.383 --> 00:52:02.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What are they afraid of, and
why can't we be told?

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:03.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
More on that as we continue.

00:52:12.997 --> 00:52:15.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In the United States, any person
who comes into contact

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:19.503 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
with extraterrestrial beings or
material can be locked up

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:22.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
for an indefinite period without
so much as a hearing.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.876 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Family members could also be
incarcerated, and all property

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:29.446 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
could be seized based on an
obscure rule buried in NASA

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:30.781 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
regulations.

00:52:30.781 --> 00:52:33.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Ostensibly, the law was meant to
allow for the quarantine of

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:36.720 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
astronauts, but it's verbiage
could be applied to any

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.522 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
American citizen.

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.524 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The law typifies NASA's
touchiness

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:42.960 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
concerning ETs and UFOs.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.529 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The space agency simply doesn't
want to talk about

00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:46.897 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
such subjects.

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:50.534 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In 1977, for example, President
Jimmy Carter asked

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:53.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NASA to resume studying UFOs
because there had been so many

00:52:53.971 --> 00:52:55.806 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
inquiries from the public.

00:52:55.806 --> 00:52:58.876 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NASA politely, but firmly,
said no thanks.

00:52:58.876 --> 00:53:02.179 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The now-canceled SETI program,
Search for Extraterrestrial

00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:05.949 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Intelligence, was renamed by
NASA in part because the space

00:53:05.949 --> 00:53:08.585 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
agency didn't want people to say
it was looking for little

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:12.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
green men, even though that's
pretty much what it was doing.

00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:14.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
-I think that there is
a cover up of sorts.

00:53:14.892 --> 00:53:17.561 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I don't know to what degree it
is, because of course, it's

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
very hard to tell what's
information what's

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:21.131 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
disinformation.

00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:23.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NARRATOR: Former astronaut
Brian O'Leary has had

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:26.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
first-hand experience with
NASA's alien paranoia.

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:29.773 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Dr. O'Leary was recruited by
NASA for a manned mission to

00:53:29.773 --> 00:53:33.177 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Mars primarily because of his
extensive writings about the

00:53:33.177 --> 00:53:34.578 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
red planet.

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:37.114 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But when O'Leary took an
interest in the so-called face

00:53:37.114 --> 00:53:40.150 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
on Mars, and suggested it might
even be the remnant of

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:43.821 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
an ancient civilization, he
encountered stiff opposition.

00:53:43.821 --> 00:53:46.090 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
-I did an optical study
of the face on Mars.

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:48.926 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And it took me four years
to publish the paper.

00:53:48.926 --> 00:53:50.928 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It was finally published in
the Journal of the British

00:53:50.928 --> 00:53:52.596 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Interplanetary Society.

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:55.599 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The first few attempts to
publish it were turned down

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:59.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
flat, and the reviewers made
such comments like Dr. O'Leary

00:53:59.937 --> 00:54:02.739 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
shouldn't spend one microsecond
of this time

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:05.909 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
inquiring into something so
ridiculous and so absurd.

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:07.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The mainstream sign is
when they start to

00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:09.313 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
look at these pictures.

00:54:09.313 --> 00:54:12.683 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In fact, I know the person that
first discovered them.

00:54:12.683 --> 00:54:13.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
His name is Toby Owen.

00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:16.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
He's a colleague of mine
in planetary science.

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And he and some of the other
people, when they started

00:54:18.489 --> 00:54:20.624 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
looking at the pictures, there
was kind of a nervous

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:23.627 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
laughter, almost like a
teenager looking at

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:26.663 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
pornography, saying, that
looks like a face.

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:30.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: In 1993, NASA launched
the ill-fated Mars

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:32.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Observer for the purpose of
thoroughly photographing the

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:34.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Martian surface.

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:36.974 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Despite intense public interest
in the face and

00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:40.310 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
surrounding features, Nasa had
to be dragged kicking and

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:43.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
screaming into an agreement that
the face region would be

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:44.515 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
photographed.

00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:47.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Even then, Nasa said it may or
may not release any such

00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:49.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
photos to the public--

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.656 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
most likely because it didn't
want to add fuel to the ET

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:56.160 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
fire, a point made moot when
the Mars Observer allegedly

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
disappeared.

00:54:57.661 --> 00:55:00.430 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Researcher Don Ecker is
convinced that Nasa has been

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:01.765 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
taken over by the military.

00:55:01.765 --> 00:55:04.668 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-The fact that NASA, over the
last couple of years, have

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:07.171 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
been slowly but surely clearing
out their civilian

00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:09.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
research personnel, and have
been bringing in retired

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.275 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
military personnel.

00:55:11.275 --> 00:55:15.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What this suggests is that
Nasa is going black.

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:18.215 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: Journalist Ecker
points to a 1991 mission of

00:55:18.215 --> 00:55:22.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the space shuttle Discovery,
STS-48, as an example of

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:24.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
NASA's participation
in a cover-up.

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:28.258 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This footage was taped from
NASA's own satellite signals.

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:31.595 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It shows several anomalous
objects floating in space near

00:55:31.595 --> 00:55:32.696 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
the shuttle--

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:34.998 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
objects which Nasa says
were ice crystals,

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:37.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
space debris, or both.

00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:40.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But analysis by some of NASA's
own consultants cast serious

00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:42.706 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
doubt on these excuses.

00:55:42.706 --> 00:55:45.609 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
At one point, the footage
clearly shows an object make a

00:55:45.609 --> 00:55:48.712 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
radical shift in direction in
apparent response to a flash

00:55:48.712 --> 00:55:50.647 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of light emanating
from the shuttle.

00:55:58.722 --> 00:55:59.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Here's the sequence again.

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:14.972 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Notice two other objects
streaking across space at

00:56:14.972 --> 00:56:16.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
incredible speeds.

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Self-propelled ice crystals,
or are they something

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:21.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
unexplainable?

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:24.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
-These objects, in fact,
were not ice.

00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:30.087 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Were some type of manufactured
vehicle, and they demonstrated

00:56:30.087 --> 00:56:34.958 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a propulsion system that we
presently on Earth either are

00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:38.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
not aware of or, if there are
elements within the government

00:56:38.662 --> 00:56:41.231 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that is aware of it, they're
keeping it under wraps.

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:43.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: To some, this sequence
of events suggest a

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.403 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
hostile inner-space encounter
between a US

00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:48.605 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
space shuttle and UFOs.

00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:52.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
To others, it's another in a
long string of inconsequential

00:56:52.142 --> 00:56:53.644 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
sightings of space junk.

00:56:57.648 --> 00:57:00.083 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The question of whether American
astronauts have seen

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:03.787 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
UFOs was settled long ago, even
though no astronauts,

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:05.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
current or former, are
willing to talk

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:07.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
about the subject today.

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:10.661 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Of the original Mercury Seven
astronauts, at least three

00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:13.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
reportedly saw anomalous
objects.

00:57:13.363 --> 00:57:15.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
John Glenn saw sparkling
fireflies

00:57:15.666 --> 00:57:17.534 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
dancing around his capsule.

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:20.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The late Deke Slayton said
he repeatedly circled a

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:23.473 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
stationary UFO while piloting
a fighter plane.

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:25.976 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And Gordon Cooper was so certain
that the craft he

00:57:25.976 --> 00:57:28.712 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
witnessed several times while
flying over Europe were of

00:57:28.712 --> 00:57:31.915 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
extraterrestrial origin that he
wrote a letter stating his

00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:34.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
opinion to the United Nations.

00:57:34.351 --> 00:57:37.387 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Cooper has since recanted his
statement, but refuses to

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:39.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
answer any questions about
what he saw, or why

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:41.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
he changed his mind.

00:57:41.725 --> 00:57:44.628 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In fact, none of the astronauts
who supposedly saw

00:57:44.628 --> 00:57:47.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
anomalous objects were willing
to respond to inquiries,

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:50.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
including astronauts Frank
Borman and James Lovell, who

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:54.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
snapped this photo of two
luminous objects from space.

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:57.240 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Or James McDivitt, who confided
in friends about his

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.409 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
own UFO sightings
while in orbit.

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:01.044 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
-They can't even tell
their spouses.

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:05.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I either get no answers,
or I get a very emotional

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:10.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
response, almost embarrassment
that I

00:58:10.354 --> 00:58:11.855 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
even asked the question.

00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:13.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's kind of ironic.

00:58:13.023 --> 00:58:14.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's one of these catch-22
situations--

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:15.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
if you know, you can't tell.

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:17.928 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
If you don't know, you
don't know anyway.

00:58:17.928 --> 00:58:20.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: UFOs have reportedly
been monitoring human

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:23.367 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
technology for decades,
perhaps centuries.

00:58:23.367 --> 00:58:26.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They followed our planes and
experimental vehicles, have

00:58:26.536 --> 00:58:29.272 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
been spotted adjacent to rocket
and missile tests, and

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:31.575 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
have done the same all
for the world.

00:58:31.575 --> 00:58:34.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-What I have been sold off the
record by certain former

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:39.883 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
members of the American space
effort was that not only have

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:43.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
there been UFOs encountered in
many space flights, and with

00:58:43.587 --> 00:58:46.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the Russians, but that the
Americans and the former

00:58:46.423 --> 00:58:50.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Soviet Union had a very close,
covert relationship working

00:58:50.394 --> 00:58:53.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
hand in hand in the pursuit of
the overall UFO phenomenon.

00:58:58.635 --> 00:59:00.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NARRATOR: Under communism,
Soviet leaders publicly

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:04.040 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
scoffed at UFO reports,
suggesting the whole matter

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
was a capitalist plot.

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:09.813 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
At the same time, the Russians
sometimes used UFOs for their

00:59:09.813 --> 00:59:11.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
own propaganda purposes.

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:14.584 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
-They had launch sites
that were secret.

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:17.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And when they launched a rocket,
they encouraged the

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:20.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
people in the area to believe
that what they had seen in the

00:59:20.457 --> 00:59:21.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
sky was a flying saucer.

00:59:21.625 --> 00:59:23.760 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They actually planted
those stories.

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I think we've done
the same thing.

00:59:25.629 --> 00:59:27.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NARRATOR: But the Russian
military clearly knew that

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:29.332 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
UFOs were real.

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:32.302 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Hidden in the archives of the
Ministry of Defense is solid

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:34.938 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
evidence of Russian
UFO encounters, on

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:36.640 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
earth and in space.

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.009 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
What's more, the Russian
government knows that the

00:59:39.009 --> 00:59:41.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
American government knows.

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:44.815 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Because the Soviets got a jump
on the US in the space race,

00:59:44.815 --> 00:59:48.251 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
they also had the first outer
space UFO sightings.

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:51.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Yuri Gagarin, the first man in
space, reportedly saw UFOs

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:54.758 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
during his flight, but said
he was not permitted

00:59:54.758 --> 00:59:56.126 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
to talk about it.

00:59:56.126 --> 00:59:58.361 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The second Russian in
space not only saw

00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:00.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
UFOs, but filmed them.

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:03.967 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
One frame of that film, showing
several UFOs dancing

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:07.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
around the capsule, was
published in a Soviet magazine

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:08.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
years later.

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:11.842 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Scientist Ramili Avramenko, one
of the chief designers of

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:14.978 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Russia's Star Wars program,
says the Soviet government

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:18.215 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
knew UFOs were from somewhere
else since day one of the

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:19.950 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
space race.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:23.119 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
-[speaking russian]

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.988 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
TRANSLATOR: At that time,
satellites in space were

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.623 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
easily countable.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:29.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But we also saw vehicles whose
technical characteristics we

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:31.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
cannot match even now.

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:35.098 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We saw tens of these in 1959.

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:38.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Surely, the existence of these
vehicles caused problems for

01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:41.238 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the US defense systems, because
you are faced with

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:44.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
this information, as well.

01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:47.077 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: These still classified
Ministry of Defense

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:50.614 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
documents, never before seen in
public, reveal that Russian

01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:54.017 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
spies learned a great deal about
UFO encounters involving

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:55.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
American astronauts.

01:00:55.886 --> 01:00:58.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The Russians are convinced
there were several direct

01:00:58.054 --> 01:01:01.091 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
encounters with UFOs while
American astronauts were on

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:04.027 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the moon, and that the Americans
haven't returned to

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:07.197 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the moon because we were
told to stay away.

01:01:07.197 --> 01:01:10.400 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Several high-ranking military
and scientific sources

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
confirmed that the Russians knew
much about the ongoing

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:14.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
UFO cover-up in America.

01:01:17.274 --> 01:01:20.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Retired Army Colonel Boris
Sokolov was in charge of the

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:24.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Soviet secret UFO projects for
10 years, and says he knew

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:27.851 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that the US military had
constructed a 40 UFO listening

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.787 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
posts as part of its
UFO research.

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:32.188 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
-I think America could
learn something.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.858 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I mean, after we gave lessons
to the Russians for 40 years

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:39.229 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
about freedom and liberty and
so on, and now they're

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:40.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
publishing a lot of stuff.

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:41.631 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I doubt it that they're
publishing

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:42.999 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
everything they have.

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:44.935 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But at least they are releasing
a lot of material.

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:47.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And our military doesn't
seem to have changed

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:49.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
too much their attitude.

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:50.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NARRATOR: The big question
about the

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:52.509 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
UFO cover-up remains--

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:53.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:11%
why?

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:55.745 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Some final thoughts on
that are just ahead.

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.368 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NARRATOR: When is a secret
not a secret?

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:21.705 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
When everyone has heard it,
but few pay attention.

01:02:21.705 --> 01:02:25.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The UFO cover-up has been so
well documented over so many

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:27.510 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
years that it has seemingly
become part

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.379 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of our popular mythology.

01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:31.114 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
It is not a myth.

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:34.150 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The government's own secret
studies concluded decades ago

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:36.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that UFOs were real.

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:39.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Those studies were suppressed,
then replaced by public

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:40.857 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
relations shams.

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:44.160 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Schemes were hatched to ridicule
the topic, to confuse

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.464 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the public, to hide the
real information.

01:02:47.464 --> 01:02:50.667 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
An extensive paper trail reveals
that many people had

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:53.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
direct knowledge of the
cover-up, and that many others

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:56.339 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
tried to get the information
but were refused.

01:02:56.339 --> 01:03:00.110 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Government agencies routinely
lie about what they know.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.046 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Other agencies issue ridiculous
cover stories and

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:04.681 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
disinformation.

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:07.851 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Scores of witnesses recall what
may be the most important

01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:09.152 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
event in history.

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:11.154 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The government says nothing.

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:14.391 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Other witnesses, including some
of our modern day heroes,

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:17.160 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
have seen the proof with their
own eyes, but are ordered to

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.695 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
keep quiet.

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:21.665 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Good people are threatened and
harassed to maintain this

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:23.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
non-secret secret.

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:27.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The best evidence makes it
abundantly, indisputably clear

01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:31.007 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that someone, somewhere has a
lot more information than the

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:32.175 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
rest of us.

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:35.178 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
-I think that there are
people who must have--

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:38.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
people in Washington and
elsewhere-- must have a

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:42.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
building full of data that I
think the scientific community

01:03:42.185 --> 01:03:43.586 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
should have.

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:47.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Data that comes on radar, from
sensors on earth, from sensors

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:50.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in the ocean, and from
sensors in space.

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:53.697 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There is a cover-up in the sense
they are keeping the

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:55.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
data for themselves.

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:58.868 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And I think the greatest secret
may be that nobody has

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:01.404 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
any idea what those
objects are.

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:03.206 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
NARRATOR: It almost seems
as if the government

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:04.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
is toying with us.

01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:07.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Wright Patterson Air Base is
widely thought to have been

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:10.080 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the home to recovered
alien technology.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
On the emblem for the base's
aptly named Foreign Technology

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:16.119 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Division is this
strange symbol.

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:18.021 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
A joke on the public?

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:21.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
George Adamski the original
contactee whose claims about

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:24.894 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
visiting Venus have been largely
discredited, was able

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:28.298 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to travel all over the world to
deliver specious lectures

01:04:28.298 --> 01:04:31.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
with the help of a special
high level passport.

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:32.869 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Who gave it to him?

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:36.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
President Ronald Reagan, who
delivered five public speeches

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:39.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
about a possible threat from
outer space, held a special

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:42.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
White House screening of the
movie "E.T.," and afterward

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:46.149 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
whispered in the year of
director Steven Spielberg.

01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:48.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-When the showing was over,
Reagan got up, put his hand on

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:50.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Steve's shoulders, and said,
you know, fewer than six

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:53.123 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
people in this room know
the whole story.

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:55.325 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: We can't say how many
people, if any, know the

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:57.861 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
full story, but certainly there
have been many who know

01:04:57.861 --> 01:05:00.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
more than the rest of us,
including some of the most

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:02.499 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
trusted personalities
of this century.

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:05.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Scientists, like Hermann Oberth,
the father of modern

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:09.339 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
rocketry, who said that UFOs are
from outer space, and that

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:11.274 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
contact had been established.

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:14.644 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Or his colleague, Wernher Von
Braun, who hinted that closer

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:17.781 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
contact with an alien
intelligence was imminent.

01:05:17.781 --> 01:05:20.884 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Or General Douglas MacArthur,
who predicted that our next

01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:23.787 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
great war would be an
interplanetary war.

01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:27.290 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Or General George Marshall, who
also said contact had been

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:31.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
made, and that UFOs could wipe
us out if they wished.

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:34.097 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Or Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter
first director

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:37.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of the CIA, who joined a
UFO group after leaving

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
government, and who said
that the next step

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
is up to the aliens.

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:44.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Or famed scientist Robert
Sarbacher, who told colleagues

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.544 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
he was invited to work on
recovered alien material, and

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:50.180 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that the matter is the most
classified subject in the

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.381 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
government.

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:54.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Or Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin,
and Winston Churchill--

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:57.320 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
each of whom ordered secret
UFO studies in their

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.721 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
respective nations.

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:01.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Or future President Gerald
Ford, who called for

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:04.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
congressional hearings so that
Americans could learn the

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.595 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
truth about UFOs.

01:06:05.595 --> 01:06:08.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Or President Jimmy Carter, who
saw his own UFO, and had

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:12.335 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
wanted to open all government
UFO files, but didn't--

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:13.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
or couldn't.

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:17.040 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Or Senator Barry Goldwater,
was denied access to UFO

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.709 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
information, but who later wrote
that a plan was in the

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:22.412 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
works to let the public
know the full story.

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:26.349 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So what is this plan, and when
do we get to see it?

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:30.053 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-The solution to avoiding
acculturation would be one of

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:31.521 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
indoctrination.

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:35.992 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And my research has exposed
a great deal of evidence--

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:39.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a total preponderance of
evidence that clearly suggests

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:40.797 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that we've been on that path.

01:06:40.797 --> 01:06:43.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The government has been
supplying us with leaked

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.835 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
information, if you will.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:51.140 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There is substantial evidence
of use a subliminal media.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Oechsler is one of
many UFO researchers who

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:56.045 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
suspects that the public is
being slowly programmed

01:06:56.045 --> 01:07:00.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
through advertising, TV shows,
movies, and other media to

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.151 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
accept the alien reality.

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:04.587 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
If such a plan isn't in
the works, perhaps

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:06.089 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
there should be one.

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:09.459 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This 1960 study prepared by the
Brookings Institute for

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:13.296 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Nasa predicted that confirmed
contact with a more advanced

01:07:13.296 --> 01:07:15.932 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
alien civilization would lead
to the collapse and

01:07:15.932 --> 01:07:18.968 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
disintegration of human culture
and institutions.

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:21.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In other words, total chaos.

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:24.407 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The study suggested that only
a gradual indoctrination

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:26.409 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
program could prevent this.

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:29.178 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Whether or not such a program
was ever implemented, the

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:30.580 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
effect has been the same--

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.448 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
people seem ready.

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:34.284 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
-So you fear the unknown.

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:38.755 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
If know all about UFOs, the
fact they're here, there's

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:40.356 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
going to be no panic.

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:44.294 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
That's an excuse they've used
since the Orson Welles radio

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:46.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
program in 1938.

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:48.398 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The people did panic.

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:51.467 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We are far more sophisticated
than that.

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:53.803 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: The public at large
may be ready, but select

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:55.405 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
groups may not.

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:58.207 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Some researchers are convinced
that the cover-up persists

01:07:58.207 --> 01:08:01.177 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because of its potential
effects on religion.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.913 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-The first thing that would
happen would be you'd have 40

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:06.549 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
million right wing
fundamentalist Christians

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.551 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
climbing the walls.

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:11.387 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And then you'd have virtually
every other opposition

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:15.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
politician streaming
in holy terror.

01:08:15.058 --> 01:08:18.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You'd have absolute chaos.

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Others think the
cover-up is maintained because

01:08:20.463 --> 01:08:23.199 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of a military mindset among
those who control the

01:08:23.199 --> 01:08:24.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
information.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-Under the guise of national
security, many things were

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:32.175 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
hidden, and many things today
are still being hidden,

01:08:32.175 --> 01:08:35.011 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
because there is a fear among
certain individuals--

01:08:35.011 --> 01:08:36.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and very covert people--

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:40.316 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that it is not good for the
national security of this

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:43.052 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
country for the citizens
to understand.

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:45.488 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: If alien technology
has been recovered by the

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:48.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
government, it could represent
the ultimate weapon system--

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:51.627 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a system that no government
would want to see in the hands

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.196 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
of another.

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:55.598 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In the Nevada desert, for
example, a top secret, highly

01:08:55.598 --> 01:09:00.169 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
secure military base known as
Area 51 is where witnesses and

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:02.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
informed sources have repeatedly
seen flying

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:06.476 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
saucers, which they say
are of alien origin.

01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:08.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-I saw eight other ones, yeah.

01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:11.514 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Former government
scientist Bob Lazar says the

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:14.584 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
disks are being studied so that
their military potential

01:09:14.584 --> 01:09:15.918 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
can be exploited.

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:18.187 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The field that's generated will

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:19.789 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
disable electronic equipment.

01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:22.125 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It could be-- it could actually
be the ultimate

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:24.027 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
weapon there is.

01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:27.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-I'm convinced that we do have
recovered craft, and that the

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:30.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
propulsion system associated
with those craft is so

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:34.237 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
sensitive that it is
related to defense.

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:38.508 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And quite obviously, that
has to be covered up.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:41.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Tim Good agrees that
national security is one

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:44.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
reason why governments won't
talk about recovered disks.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:47.083 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And he agrees that such
technology has likely been

01:09:47.083 --> 01:09:49.085 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
studied at Area 51.

01:09:49.085 --> 01:09:51.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But he also sees other reasons
for the government's

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:52.989 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
reluctance.

01:09:52.989 --> 01:09:54.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-Well, I think now something
like three and a half thousand

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:59.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
pilots have reported sightings
of UFOs now--

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:01.564 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
military and civilian pilots.

01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:03.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I've spoken to a number of
pilots who have had near

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:05.468 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
collisions with UFOs.

01:10:05.468 --> 01:10:08.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If it were to be revealed that
have been quite a number of

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:13.409 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
near collisions, and that in
some cases, aircraft have even

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:14.744 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
disappeared.

01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:18.347 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In "Above Top Secret," I've
cited at least two instances

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:20.650 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
where aircraft have disappeared
shortly after UFOs

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:23.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
have been seen in the vicinity
or reported by the pilot.

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:25.988 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
That's not the sort of
information that governments

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:27.824 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
want to let out to the public.

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:30.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I mean, people would be wary
about flying anymore.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.829 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Bob Dean thinks it
would be difficult for the

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:35.765 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
government to make a limited
announcement, because any

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:39.235 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
official acknowledgement would
open a floodgate of sources.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:43.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-We've got astronauts, top
military people who are

01:10:43.139 --> 01:10:48.311 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
willing to tell us in an open
forum what they've seen, and

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:51.447 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
what they've experienced, if
they can be guaranteed that

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:53.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
their careers and their families
are not going to be

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:54.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
in danger.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:59.589 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-And I said before that if that
announcement were made to

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:01.624 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
something of that effect, I
would rather be in the liquor

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:04.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
business than the real estate.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.629 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Author and researcher
Budd Hopkins is

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:09.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
convinced that so-called alien
abductions is at the heart of

01:11:09.799 --> 01:11:13.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the cover-up, because they
seemingly happen so often, and

01:11:13.136 --> 01:11:16.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
there doesn't seem to be
anything anyone can do to stop

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.640 align:middle line:79% position:49% size:13%
them.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.610 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-These people or creatures or
whatever they are here, and

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
doing what they want to with
the population, able to

01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:25.715 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
control their memories, float
them out of their houses or

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:29.819 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
their cars or whatever, do
physical examinations, take

01:11:29.819 --> 01:11:31.220 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
samples and send them back.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.222 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And there's nothing the
government can do about it.

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Can you imagine any government
leader standing up and

01:11:35.358 --> 01:11:37.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
admitting that publicly?

01:11:37.493 --> 01:11:41.330 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It would be an absolute
abdication of that sense of

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:43.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
control that all politicians
like to have.

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:45.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Nobody will do that.

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:47.036 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: Stan Friedman
maintains that people could

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:49.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
handle the truth without
widespread panic.

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:52.775 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But he also believes the effects
would be profound.

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:54.343 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-I mean, some of the things
that would happen--

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:56.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I suppose church attendance,
mental hospital admissions

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:59.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
would go, stock market
would go down.

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:02.084 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But I think the biggest thing
that would happen, based on

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:05.421 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
600 college lectures-- lot of
young people out there--

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:07.256 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is that there'd be an immediate
push on the part of

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:08.691 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the younger generation--

01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:10.760 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which was never alive when there
wasn't a space program,

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.695 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
interestingly enough--

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:15.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
for a whole new view of
ourselves, instead of as

01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:20.102 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Americans, Russians, Chinese,
Cubans, Ghanians, whatever--

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:21.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
as earthlings.

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:23.739 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Because obviously from an alien
viewpoint, we are all

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:25.208 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
earthlings.

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:27.376 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There's no government on this
planet that wants that.

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:29.579 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Interestingly enough,
NASA has already

01:12:29.579 --> 01:12:32.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
drafted a list of protocols to
be followed in the event that

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:36.219 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
contact with aliens is ever
publicly confirmed.

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:39.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Even with a game plan to follow,
any such announcement

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
would be dicey business.

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:43.526 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Let's say that the president
decided to make an

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:44.727 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
announcement.

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:47.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This is-- if he made it today,
this is what I think

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:50.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that he would say.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:53.603 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-Ladies and gentleman,
extraterrestrial spacecraft

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:55.705 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
are operating in our minds.

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:57.406 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
-They can fly circles
around the best

01:12:57.406 --> 01:12:59.208 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
aircraft we have in flight.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
-Where they come from,
we do not know.

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:03.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Who is in them, we
do not know.

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:05.681 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-We do know that they can
paralyze anybody they want to

01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:08.150 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
at will, take them
into their craft.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:11.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-We do not know if they
represent a threat, But we

01:13:11.754 --> 01:13:13.623 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
know that they're here, and
there isn't a damn thing we

01:13:13.623 --> 01:13:14.657 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
can do about.

01:13:14.657 --> 01:13:15.791 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-Thank you, and good night.

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:20.730 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: If the government
can't issue a declaration,

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.765 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
what about the visitors
themselves?

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:25.101 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Although it seems as if their
presence has become more

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:28.137 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
obvious over the past few
decades, there apparently has

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:30.139 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
been no overt attempt
at blowing

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:31.607 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the lid off the cover-up.

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:32.975 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
-I get the feeling that
they don't want us

01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:34.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to solve this feeling.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I get the feeling that
they want to

01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:37.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
protect the secrecy program.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.316 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I get the feeling that they
don't like what is happening

01:13:40.316 --> 01:13:42.785 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in our society in terms of
learning about them.

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:45.288 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: If the visitors won't
end the secrecy, and if

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:47.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the government can't, the burden
for uncovering the

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:49.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
truth falls to the public.

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:52.795 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The UFO question isn't something
which belongs solely

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:55.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in the domain of tabloids,
talk shows, or

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.766 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
movies of the week.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:59.502 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
We all have a stake
in the answer.

01:13:59.502 --> 01:14:01.804 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-I think the only hope for a
decent future for this planet

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:04.307 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is an earthling orientation.

01:14:04.307 --> 01:14:06.809 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The easiest way to get it is to
recognize that somebody's

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.811 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
coming here, and to
them, we are all

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:10.346 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
earthlings, like it or not.

01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:11.781 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
