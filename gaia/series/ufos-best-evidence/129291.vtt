NARRATOR: When the moon is
full in North Alabama.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:38.505 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When clouds pursue their own
agenda, gobbling up sky as if

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.175 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they owned it, dark nights get
darker and strange things are

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
known to happen.

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.815 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Balls of light appear and
disappear, floating orbs flip

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
among the trees, and
serene pastures

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
become killing fields.

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:56.323 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Farmer David McClendon knows.

00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:59.593 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
To him, the lights in the sky
aren't a casual diversion.

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
McClendon's means are modest,
his profit margins slim, so

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.732 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
when one of his calves is
silently butchered in the

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:09.002 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
night, just yards away from his
bedroom, he's more than

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
curious about the culprit.

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-I called the DeKalb Sheriff's
Department.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.075 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They come out here.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.543 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
It's here.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:19.012 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They looked at the calf
approximately three to five

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:23.016 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
minutes and told me that it
was a predator kill, even

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:26.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
though there wasn't no
footprints or no sign of blood

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
on the ground.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.588 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
I questioned him
about it again.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:32.025 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He told be to bury the calf
and forget about it.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.427 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
NARRATOR: A predator.

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
A predator capable of leaving
no tracks or signs.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.533 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
A predator which cuts the
victimized animal with

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:44.037 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
surgical precision, excising
internal organs, even bones,

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:46.039 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
without spilling any blood.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.376 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
A predator which can bring down
a healthy calf or even an

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:53.447 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
800 pound bull, but leave no
indications of a struggle.

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:58.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-I don't think they wanna
confront whoever or whatever's

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.286 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
doing this.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.388 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I think they're scared,
or they ain't got

00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:04.057 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
no answer for it.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:07.394 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Who or what sliced up
David McClendon's calf, as

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
well as dozens of animals
owned by his neighbors?

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.067 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Who or what is responsible for
the eerie but beautiful

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:17.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
impressions left in crop
fields the world over.

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:21.074 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Why are thousands of people now
regurgitating incredible,

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:24.077 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
disturbingly identical memories
of encounters with

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
something alien?

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.784 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The UFO mystery used
to be much simpler.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:32.019 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Lights in the sky.

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.587 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Now you see them,
now you don't.

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:36.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But in the past few years, the
questions have deepened.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.192 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Something profound appears to
be happening to our planet.

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:41.795 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Something related to
an alien presence.

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.398 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Today, the search for UFO
evidence takes us into

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
increasingly bizarre realms.

NARRATOR: Sand Mountain,
Alabama, is an ancient and

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.474 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
mysterious place.

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:30.243 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This was sacred ground to
the Cherokee Nation.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:34.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It was here that Chief Sequoia
wrote the Cherokee alphabet,

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
inspired, they say, by
spirits and visions.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The Cherokee are gone, but
the spirits remain.

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Tiny Fyffe, Alabama, population
1,600, as down home

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
as a town can get.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:55.168 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A dry county community of
farmers with one stoplight,

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:58.071 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
one department store, but
more UFO sightings

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.173 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
than any 10 big cities.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:04.744 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In 1989, Fyffe was the hub of
an international UFO furor,

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:08.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with more per capita saucer
sightings than any other place

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:09.416 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
in the world.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Among those who witnessed UFOs
was police chief Junior

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:15.188 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Garmany and most of his
officers, along with nearly

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
everyone else in town.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-I would say at least 75%, and
it could go as high as 90% of

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the people in this are
have seen something

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that they can't explain.

00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:30.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: Newspaperman Baker may
have ink in his veins, but

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.906 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it's not the type of
ink used to publish

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:34.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
nonsense of ghost stories.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.209 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
That's not the sort
of journalism the

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.677 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
people of Fyffe expect.

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:40.814 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Baker prints what people
here know to be true.

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:43.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Something strange has been
flying over Fyffe for

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:45.218 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
a long, long time.

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:47.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Baker's wife captured photos
of one of the odd lights

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
dancing above the horizon.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:52.425 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Over the years, Alabama cameras
have produced many

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.461 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
other photos and videos.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:59.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-As far back as memory seems
to go around here, our

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:01.968 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
grandfathers, my wife's
grandfather had a sighting of

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:05.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
what he described as a
cigar shape back when

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.973 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
he was a young man.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Yeah, all kinds of
different shapes.

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:14.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
From cigar shapes to classic
flying saucer shape, to lights

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.249 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
in the sky.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.452 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: The 1989 UFO flap
drew hordes of skeptical,

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:22.822 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
scoffing reporters, who
ridiculed residents as hicks

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.458 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and bumpkins, leaving emotional
scars which are

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
still evident.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.995 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
-We don't talk to
nobody about it.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:31.798 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Now the reporters are
back in force, drawn not

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:35.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
only by the latest wave of UFO
sightings, but also by what

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:40.006 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
appears to be a related and
gruesome UFO side effect.

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
-That's a good waste
of beef, isn't it?

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.276 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
-Yeah, it is.

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:45.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Police officer Ted
Oliphant has made this same

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:49.182 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
macabre walk more than 30 times
in six months, in cow

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.318 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
pastures all over
DeKalb County.

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:55.188 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Someone or something has been
slicing up cattle, leaving

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:58.158 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
behind bloated hunks of
rotting beef steak.

00:05:58.158 --> 00:05:59.693 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
-One of the things you're
looking at is, like,

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.294 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the large oval cut.

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And back over this way on the
side there, that flat line cut

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.436 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
there, there's just
no way that that

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:10.303 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
was done by a predator--

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:12.105 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
NARRATOR: That's right.

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:13.807 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
When they do something, an
animal does, they tear

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:15.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
everything, and that
wasn't torn.

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:16.710 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
That's cut straight.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: The victimized farmer,
who was also a part

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
time school teacher, doesn't
want his name used, but freely

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:26.052 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
states that he doesn't buy the
story told by the first law

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.821 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
men to arrive on the scene.

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:30.323 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Predators didn't do this
to his animal.

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:33.627 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
-The trachea had been
cut, neat in--

00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:34.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
neat into.

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:35.962 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And animals don't cut things.

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.330 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
They tear things.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.335 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The slab of meat off the back
had been cut neatly.

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:43.803 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
No tracks.

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:47.807 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It hadn't rained in a couple
days, but if anybody got in

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:51.077 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
here with a vehicle, they'd have
to come through my yard.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I've got dogs that
bark, and they would

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:54.581 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
bark quite a bit.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.584 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And no vehicle come
through my yard.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: A few miles away and
a few days earlier, Jimmy and

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Margaret Pope had looked out
their dining room window and

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:05.425 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
make their own grisly
discovery.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.595 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
One of their cows had been
chopped up in bizarre fashion

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
within spitting distance
of their back door.

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:13.566 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Her side was cut out, and it
was just like it was just

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:15.368 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
sliced off clean.

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:17.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
And there was no
blood anywhere.

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:22.642 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then there was like a four
inch round circle off of her

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:27.814 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
shoulder, and then there was a
cut starting in the center of

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:32.018 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
her mouth, and it went all the
way around into an oval shape

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:33.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and her teeth were gone.

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:36.389 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And there were no
blood anyway.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The ground was just--

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.591 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
JIMMY POPE (OFFSCREEN):
It was really wet.

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:39.492 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
MAGARET POPE (OFFSCREEN):
Undisturbed.

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:40.794 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
JIMMY POPE (OFFSCREEN):
Wet too.

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
At that time there had
been  lot of rain.

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:45.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And there should have been
some-- you know, should have

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:48.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
been some kind of a struggle
or something.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.737 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
MAGARET POPE (OFFSCREEN): There
was no sign of struggle

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:51.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
or anything.

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:53.473 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The ground, I mean,
it was just--

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.574 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
There was nothing
on the ground.

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
No blood, no tracks, nothing.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.979 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
-His cow had had its
rectum cut out,

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
sexual organs removed.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.415 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It had a strange protrusion
here.

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:04.417 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
There's an incision
along the belly.

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.119 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
NARRATOR: Ted Oliphant's
photo album is a

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:07.887 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
far cry from typical.

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:09.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
No pictures of the family.

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:11.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
No vacation snapshots.

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:15.228 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Just row after row of mutilated
animals, a monstrous

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:19.032 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
morgue of tortured bovines, and
Oliphant knows them all.

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:21.768 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Stranger than that was the
incision we found on the face

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:25.538 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of the animal on its right jaw,
a large, oval incision,

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
jaw stripped clean to the
bone, and the tongue was

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.943 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
removed, cut out deep
in the throat.

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We always find pretty much the
same thing with the animals.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:37.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If it's a female cow, the sex
organs and the colon have been

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.487 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
cored out, almost like you take
a stove pipe and shoved

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:43.923 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
it in there and cored out
the material there.

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:47.494 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Many times, milk sacks, the
udders are completely missing.

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:49.996 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Jaws have been stripped
to the bone.

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:51.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Tongues have been removed,
individual

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:53.767 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
ears have been removed.

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:55.068 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Various organs have
been removed.

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:57.837 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The heart, male sex organs.

00:08:57.837 --> 00:09:00.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We've ruled out predator animals
doing this at this

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:03.343 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
point because the majority of
the wounds we've found on the

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:05.011 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
animals aren't really wounds.

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
They're incisions.

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:07.514 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They've been done either
with a knife or

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:09.783 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
something much different.

00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:11.851 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Oliphant's insistence
that creditors

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
predators could not be
responsible for the cattle

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.456 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
killings has made him
unpopular with rival

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:18.958 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
investigators, most of whom
seem to just want

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.493 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
this mess to go away.

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:23.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-It's really making people angry
because they can't find

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
out what's going on.

00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:28.902 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The Sheriff's Department has
made the statement that

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:32.305 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
mutilations are not going on,
that they're not happening

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:35.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
here, but the Sheriff's carrying
pictures around of

00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
cows that have been mutilated.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.112 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
But they're--

00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:41.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The PR people are telling us
that nothing's going on.

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:51.524 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: When the sun dips
below the giant saguaros of

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:55.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Southern Arizona's harsh desert,
silent death awakens

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.263 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and goes in search of prey.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.200 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
No one can say how many animals
have been slaughtered,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.669 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
because most ranchers,
especially those Native

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:05.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
American ranchers who live
on the reservations, are

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:07.073 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
reluctant to talk about it.

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:12.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-Yeah, there's been a number
of rabbits, deer, one horse

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:14.547 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
that I know of.

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:16.516 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
Mostly cattle.

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:18.918 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There's been a case or two,
George, where there have been

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:21.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
some domestic pets
have been found

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
mutilated in the same way.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.925 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And some of the answers they've
come up with here is,

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:27.427 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
oh, it's obviously predators.

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:28.495 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
Well, look.

00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:30.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Predators won't even
touch the animal

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
after it's been mutilated.

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:35.568 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Bob Dean, a former
military intelligence staffer

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:39.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
who spent 14 years with the Pima
County Sheriff's Office

00:10:39.072 --> 00:10:42.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
has been waging a lonely
campaign against what he views

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
as sheer stupidity.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.646 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Unlike their Alabama
counterparts, Arizona

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:50.083 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
investigators have all but ruled
out predators as being

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:52.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
responsible for the animal
mutilations, including the

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:56.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
deaths of 50 cattle in
one six month period.

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:59.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Here, the designated mutilator
is none other than Satan

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:03.596 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
himself, or rather his
disciples, scalpel wielding

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Beelzebubs in search of animal
parts for use in unspeakable

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.102 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
ceremonies.

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:11.938 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
At least that's the story the
newspapers have picked up on.

00:11:11.938 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Dean has accompanied
investigators to several

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.744 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
mutilation sites and says the
officers have confided that

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:20.613 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
devil worshippers could
not be responsible for

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.348 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
this strange harvest.

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:23.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-He says, you can forget that.

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:25.785 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
He says, we've been
involved with this

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
thing for a long time.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
He says, we know
the satanists.

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We actually know who they are.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.625 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
We know their MO.

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:33.993 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
We followed them.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:35.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I could go and point three
or four of them out

00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:36.629 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
to you right now.

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And he says, they're not
involved in this.

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
He says, when they go on a scene
or they do something,

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.835 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
it's as clear as it can be.

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:46.205 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He says, I'm asking you to
consider here that this is an

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.840 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
800 pound animal.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.976 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
There's no sign of a struggle.

00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:51.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
There's no tracks.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.112 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
There's no markings
of any kind.

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
There's no blood
in the animal.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
There's no blood
on the ground.

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:59.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
How can someone get this 800
pound animal just to lay down?

00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:03.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: We contacted Arizona
agriculture officials who told

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:06.659 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
us that they had consulted cult
experts and had found no

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:08.695 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
evidence that devil worshippers
might be

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
responsible for the
mutilations.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.167 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In fact, toxicology and other
tests conducted on the

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
carcasses failed to even
determine a cause of death in

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.105 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
any of the animals.

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:22.675 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
What they did confirm is that
Arizona ranchers are angry.

00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:24.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Angry enough to take
the law into their

00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:26.679 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
own hands if necessary.

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:32.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-The animal mutilation mystery
started back in 1967, and that

00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:35.254 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
first animal was a horse that
was found stripped of flesh

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:37.357 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
from the neck up in
southern Colorado.

00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:40.693 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And even then, the newspaper
headlines in the United States

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:45.331 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and worldwide were, did
a UFO zap this horse.

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.533 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Journalist Linda Howe
has been studying the

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.836 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
mutilation mystery for
more than a decade.

00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:53.406 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In case after case, state
after state, witnesses,

00:12:53.406 --> 00:12:56.609 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
including law men, report a
correlation between animal

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:59.145 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
mutilations and UFO activity.

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:04.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-As I researched more and more
in the story, I heard from

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
ranchers , from law enforcement,
from sheriffs,

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:09.889 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
from even fellow journalists,
one amazing

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:11.724 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
UFO story after another.

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:16.195 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And most people said, I'll tell
you off the record, but

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:18.898 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they did not want to commit
themselves to being on

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:22.468 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
television talking about seeing
a football field orange

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
glowing light over a pasture
where one of these animals was

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:26.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
found mutilated.

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:28.741 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: In Arizona as in
Alabama, the mutilations have

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:32.512 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
been accompanied by increased
UFO activity.

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:34.247 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Ladies and gentlemen, thanks
for showing up.

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:35.748 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
This is UFOAZ Talks.

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:39.085 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Ted Loman the hosts
a weekly UFO TV talk show in

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:41.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Tuscon, and has become an
unofficial clearinghouse for

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:43.756 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
UFO sighting reports.

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:47.326 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He too notices a correlation
between lights in the sky and

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
death on the ground.

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:52.298 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
-I think there's a lot of
it, and there's always

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:53.599 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
been a lot of it.

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:55.768 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Tuscon has always
known about it.

00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:58.171 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: In Fyffe, Ted Oliphant
struggles to convince

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:01.774 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
his colleagues the predators
can't do what's being done.

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:05.144 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In Tucson, Bob Dean finds
himself in the strange

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:08.781 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
position of defending the
reputation of satanic cults.

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:11.951 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Both have suspicions, but
neither have solid answers.

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:14.987 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We'll return to their stories
later in the program.

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:22.261 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:24.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-I don't think they're here to
swoop down on our supermarkets

00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:27.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and take us over, and I also
don't think they're here to

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
tell us how to clean up the
environment and take care of

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:33.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the garbage, and those are
the two kinds of rather

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:37.343 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
simple-minded versions that
we're getting all the time.

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:39.479 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It's far more complicated
than that.

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:41.814 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: New York City artist,
author, and lecturer

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:44.884 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Budd Hopkins knows he's bitten
off a big chunk.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:48.721 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
As usual, he finds himself in
the unenviable position of

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:52.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
trying to convince an audience
that space aliens are not only

00:14:52.024 --> 00:14:55.828 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
real, they're here, and on a
fairly regular and widespread

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:58.831 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
basis, they enter people's
homes, float them out through

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:02.368 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a window or wall into a waiting
spaceship, conduct

00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:05.805 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
invasive medical procedures, and
then return the victims to

00:15:05.805 --> 00:15:09.175 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
their beds with little or no
memories of these unthinkable

00:15:09.175 --> 00:15:10.042 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
encounters.

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.544 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
It's a tall order.

00:15:11.544 --> 00:15:14.847 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-When people talk about wanting
physical evidence in

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:16.516 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
abduction, they really
mean one thing.

00:15:16.516 --> 00:15:20.419 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I want to see a spacecraft or
a big hunk of a spacecraft.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.522 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I want to walk up to it and see
it, or at least I want to

00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:24.824 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
see an alien sitting there, or
a dead alien or something.

00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:29.228 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
That's what they want, which
is almost like saying about

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:33.766 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
some other issue, for instance,
did Adolf Hitler

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.201 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
commit suicide in Berlin.

00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:38.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I want to have been there to see
him shoot himself, and I

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:41.874 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
want to see that little
burnt mustache, and a

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.376 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
body, and so forth.

00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:46.379 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Hopkins is, by far,
the most experienced and best

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:48.748 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
known abduction researcher
in the world.

00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:51.017 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Abduction guru, his critics
call him, a

00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:52.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
guy out to sell books.

00:15:52.752 --> 00:15:55.888 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
A courageous pioneer, his
supporters retort, who is

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:58.391 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
dragging the scientific
community, kicking and

00:15:58.391 --> 00:16:00.893 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
screaming, into the
21st century.

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.895 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Hopkins has sold books,
no question.

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
Lots of them.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.632 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And his lack of scientific
credentials certainly opens

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
him up to bitter criticism
from those with

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
degrees on the wall.

00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:13.539 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But, if he's a money grubbing
messiah, he is among the most

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:15.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
reluctant on record.

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:17.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-Nobody wants this to be real.

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Everybody requires it to be on
some kind of shelf in the

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:24.984 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
mind, this really can't
be going on.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Even I feel that need.

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:32.258 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And I think human resistance to
this is so powerful that it

00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:33.926 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
cannot be underestimated.

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:36.529 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Nobody wants this to be true.

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:38.831 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: Resistance to the
possibility of alien

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:41.934 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
abductions has been nearly
universal among scientists and

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:44.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
mental health professionals,
most of whom haven't studied

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:46.806 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
the data whatsoever.

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:50.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But it's been a godsend to
thousands, perhaps millions of

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:53.512 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
confused people concerned
about their sanity.

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:56.983 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In a town outside Nashville,
Tennessee, a family man named

00:16:56.983 --> 00:17:00.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Herman is relating some of the
unbelievable experiences he's

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:02.455 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
had since childhood.

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:05.958 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Experiences which didn't make
sense until he read about the

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.793 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
abduction syndrome.

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:11.497 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Earliest memories, it seemed
like, when I was a kid in

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
kindergarten, that all the
other kids made fun of me

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because when they were sitting
there drawing pictures of

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:20.206 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
cars, I was drawing pictures of
spaceships and saying that

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:22.541 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I was talking to the kids and
my friends and telling them

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:25.378 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that by the time that
I died of old age,

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:26.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that they would be--

00:17:26.946 --> 00:17:30.316 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
be people from other planets
living here on the Earth.

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:32.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They all laughed at me and
everything, called me crazy,

00:17:32.919 --> 00:17:36.222 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and so I just eventually, after
a few years of school of

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:39.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
ridicule, I just withdrawed into
myself and didn't talk to

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:41.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
anybody else about it.

00:17:41.594 --> 00:17:45.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
From about time that I was 13,
a lot of things started

00:17:45.298 --> 00:17:46.999 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
happening about then.

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:49.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The last thing I really remember
is running into a

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:52.038 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
light, a bright light shining
on the ground.

00:17:52.038 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And the next thing I remember
is, I'm standing in front of

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.711 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
my dad's house, which was still
about another mile away,

00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:02.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I'd missed about an hour to an
hour and a half of time.

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:06.085 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And the next morning when I got
up, I noticed little stars

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:09.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
on each arm, and they looked
like a little pizza cutter had

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.957 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
been rolled down my
arm and pulled out

00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:12.658 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
little plugs of skin.

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:15.061 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-And then I walked back to here
and there was this little

00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:17.096 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
man standing right there.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:19.031 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Right there by where you
are, pretty much.

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:20.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
Right there.

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:24.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But he was really short and he
had on, like, a silver suit.

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:26.205 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I think it was like a
dark, silver suit,

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:27.940 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
maybe grayish suit.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.041 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And he had a really
large head.

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.043 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
He was only like to here.

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:33.179 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: Nancy Anderson of
Las Vegas has conscious

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:36.282 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
memories of several encounters
with alien beings.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:39.318 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
She also has other telltale
signs of abduction

00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:43.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
experiences, including periods
of missing time, unexplained

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:47.093 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
marks and scars, and memories
of physical contact with

00:18:47.093 --> 00:18:48.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
terrifying entities.

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:51.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
-When I woke up and that
gray was across my

00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:53.065 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
knees, I was so scared.

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:54.800 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I've never been that scared
in my entire life.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I tried to move or scream,
and I couldn't.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
I just couldn't.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:01.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I really tried to fight him,
and I couldn't do any--

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:01.907 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
nothing would come out.

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:02.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I was just, like, paralyzed.

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:04.076 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He wasn't very heavy on me.

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:07.079 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
He probably weighed about
45 or 50 pounds.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.447 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
He wasn't very heavy.

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:10.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Elke Emmons can't
remember what happened to her.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
All she knows is that she
watched a UFO land behind her

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.321 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
home in Michigan.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The rest is a blank.

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:22.528 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-It just gradually settled down
in the field, and at that

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:25.898 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
point, I panicked and I shut
off all the lights.

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:29.101 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I went upstairs and I hid
in the corner the bedroom.

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:33.172 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And, as I told you, I sat there
for what seemed to be no

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:38.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
more than a minute or two, and
then I woke up in the morning.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:43.349 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I obviously lost the time,
because I don't know how I got

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:46.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in bed in the morning, and
I lost the whole night.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:49.121 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Missing time is the
phrase coined by Budd Hopkins

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:51.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to describe the memory
lapses reported by

00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:53.993 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
3/4 of alleged abductees.

00:19:53.993 --> 00:19:57.329 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It is but one of the common
denominators reported by so

00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:00.499 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
many people all over the world,
people who don't know

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:03.135 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
each other and who have nothing
to gain by relating

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
their stories.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.272 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-The scope of it is enormous.

00:20:06.272 --> 00:20:11.343 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I have had police officers
who are abductees

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.178 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
who've come to me.

00:20:12.178 --> 00:20:13.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I've had housewives.

00:20:13.479 --> 00:20:16.315 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I've had two people who
are well known in the

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
entertainment field
who are abductees.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I've had, as I mentioned,
psychiatrists who are

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:26.692 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
abductees, psychologists,
doctors, nurses, lawyers.

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:29.228 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
A full colonel in an important
position in the army recently

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:31.564 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
came to me about his
experiences.

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:36.435 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is a completely cross
cultural phenomenon.

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:39.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It gets into every socioeconomic
area.

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:41.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: The only things all of
these people have in common

00:20:41.874 --> 00:20:45.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
are their recollections of these
unbelievable encounters

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.179 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and their desire
to understand.

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:49.548 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
For the most part, they haven't
received much help

00:20:49.548 --> 00:20:52.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from science or the mental
health profession.

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:55.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Such critics as Carl Sagan
have dismissed abduction

00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:59.191 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
reports as hallucinations,
fantasies, hoaxes, or the

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:01.927 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
result of psychiatric traumas
brought on by

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:03.896 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
childhood sexual abuse.

00:21:03.896 --> 00:21:06.866 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There's only one problem with
these various explanations.

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:08.701 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
None of them fit the facts.

00:21:08.701 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-The cliche image is, well,
a psychiatrist could

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
explain this away.

00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But the psychiatrists themselves
are saying, in

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
fact, we can't explain
them away.

00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:17.977 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In fact, this is extraordinarily
interesting

00:21:17.977 --> 00:21:19.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
and important.

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:22.181 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I think that little by
little, more and more people,

00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:24.216 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
as they have come into first
hand contact with this

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:30.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
material, are realizing that
they're up against, at this

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:31.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
point, what may be the
most important

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.959 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
event in human history.

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:36.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Gaining acceptance
and assistance from science

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:39.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and medicine has proven a rugged
challenge, but change

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
is in the air.

00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:44.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
More on that in a few minutes.

00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:46.572 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-Oh, now tell us about the
last time when you were

00:21:46.572 --> 00:21:49.108 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
abducted, the very last time.

00:21:49.108 --> 00:21:52.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: If talk radio really
is the last bastion of direct

00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:55.114 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
democracy, then what is
the public trying to

00:21:55.114 --> 00:21:56.882 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
tell us about UFOs?

00:21:56.882 --> 00:22:00.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Nationally syndicated hosts like
Billy Goodman know that

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:03.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the UFO topic, in all of
its forms, is a staple.

00:22:03.756 --> 00:22:06.559 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It is raised night after night,
year after year by

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:08.093 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
audience members.

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:11.263 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
While most other media can't or
won't address the subject,

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:13.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
talk radio revels in it.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:16.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-And what was your encounter
like, may I ask?

00:22:16.268 --> 00:22:19.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Several
disk-shaped objects flew above

00:22:19.638 --> 00:22:23.475 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
my house, hovered, maneuvered
in various manners.

00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:26.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Hovering disks are
somewhat passe these days.

00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:30.549 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Radio shows, TV tabloids, and
popular books have repeatedly

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:31.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
covered this ground.

00:22:31.984 --> 00:22:35.187 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
But it almost seems as if
the phenomenon itself

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.622 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
wants to up the ante.

00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:40.292 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In the '40s and '50s, UFOs were
little more than elusive

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:43.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
lights in the sky, a
popular curiosity.

00:22:43.329 --> 00:22:46.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This, for example, is regarded
by some as the first modern

00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
era UFO photo, taken in
1947 over Seattle.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In the 1960s, the lights
started landing.

00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:58.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Credible witnesses such as New
Mexico police officer Lonnia

00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Zamora risked their reputations
by reporting what

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.314 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
they had seen.

00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Several thousand landing site
cases have since been

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.318 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
documented.

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:09.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It was also in the '60s that
the first cases of alleged

00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
alien abduction gained
prominence.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.227 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Betty and Barney Hills' lives
were turned upside down by

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.363 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
their seemingly incredulous
account.

00:23:17.363 --> 00:23:19.031 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They weren't really the
first, and they

00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:20.666 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
certainly weren't the last.

00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:23.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In the '70s, burgeoning
abduction reports bubbled to a

00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:27.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
surface, suddenly crowded by
equally bizarre phenomena.

00:23:27.673 --> 00:23:31.343 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Animal mutilations temporarily
centered in the American West,

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:33.078 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and inexplicable inexplicable
crop

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:35.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
formations focused in Britain.

00:23:35.047 --> 00:23:37.249 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Similar formations appeared
in the ice of

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:39.251 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
frozen lakes in Russia.

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:42.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
UFO sightings were linked to all
of the above by witnesses

00:23:42.688 --> 00:23:44.189 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and researchers.

00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:46.125 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The '80s and the '90s
have seen the

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:48.027 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
stakes raised once again.

00:23:48.027 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Reports of abductions have
escalated, mutilations abound

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
on a worldwide scale, and crop
formations have progressed

00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:58.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
from simple circles to intricate
designs on every

00:23:58.837 --> 00:24:02.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
continent, as if someone is
trying to tell us something.

00:24:02.408 --> 00:24:05.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-You've got the people to say
that they're aliens from space

00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:07.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
trying to tell us something.

00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:08.514 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But then someone else says,
well, if they're trying to

00:24:08.514 --> 00:24:10.616 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
talk to us, they aren't
doing a very good job.

00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:13.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Scientist Dudley was
drawn into crop formation

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:15.721 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
research when someone asked
him to take a look at some

00:24:15.721 --> 00:24:18.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
soil samples from an
English field.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.792 align:middle line:79% position:49% size:13%
-Yes.

00:24:19.792 --> 00:24:21.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
What we found a were short,
half-lifed elements that could

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:25.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
only be produced by high
energy physics.

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:28.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
These elements were not the
typical elements you find in

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:30.903 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
hospital waste or even from
nuclear reactors.

00:24:30.903 --> 00:24:33.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They're the kind of elements you
would find if you were to

00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:37.409 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
bombard soil with some high
energy protons or deuterons.

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:39.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Dudley, along with
scores of other scientists and

00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:42.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
researchers, ended up in England
during crop circle

00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:45.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
season, although the term circle
doesn't do justice to

00:24:45.751 --> 00:24:48.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
the shapes exhibited
by unseen artists.

00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:51.056 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Just when observers would
boastfully announce that they

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:53.959 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
had figured out the physics
the formations, the rules

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:57.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
would change, almost as if
someone was listening.

00:24:57.429 --> 00:25:00.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-There is every indication
that there is very high

00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:02.401 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
intelligence behind this.

00:25:02.401 --> 00:25:03.802 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There's lots of other things.

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:06.772 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
For example, all the different
dimensions of crop circles end

00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:10.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
up falling into the diatonic
scale of music.

00:25:10.142 --> 00:25:13.912 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The diatonic scale, these
ratios do not show up in

00:25:13.912 --> 00:25:15.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
nature at all.

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:15.948 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
They only show up

00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:18.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
psychologically in music scales.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.421 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NARRATOR: Without question,
some of the

00:25:22.421 --> 00:25:24.156 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
formations were hoaxed.

00:25:24.156 --> 00:25:27.726 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Two English barflies named Doug
and Dave emerged for the

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
media and claimed credit for
creating all of the English

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:34.466 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
formations, a woefully specious
claim considering the

00:25:34.466 --> 00:25:38.036 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
sheer number, size, and
complexity of some designs,

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:40.472 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
many of which appeared
in other countries.

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:42.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Naturally, reporters
bought it.

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:45.978 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
A subsequent cash prize contest
produced a spirited

00:25:45.978 --> 00:25:49.314 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
crop circle competition, which
was all the press needed.

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:53.118 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If some agroglyphs could be
faked, then all must be fakes.

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:57.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This was and is the prevailing
media attitude, akin to saying

00:25:57.322 --> 00:26:01.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that, if some $20 bills can be
counterfeited, then all 20s

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:02.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
must be funny money.

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:06.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-Wheat stalks themselves, in a
real crop circle, one that's

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
formed by whatever this energy
force is, the wheat stocks are

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
bent over at right angles.

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:14.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They're not harmed at all.

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:18.544 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They continue growing, and it's
as if an energy force

00:26:18.544 --> 00:26:22.014 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
field were impinging on the
wheat stalks to form these

00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:23.248 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
very complicated symbols.

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:26.351 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It's like a cosmic artist
is at work here.

00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:28.754 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Dr. O'Leary and other
researchers refused to

00:26:28.754 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
accept the easy explanation,
because too much of the

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
emerging evidence suggested
otherwise.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
When the formations were
simple circles, a few

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:40.532 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
scientists insisted they were
created by wind vortices,

00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:42.034 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
mini-tornadoes.

00:26:42.034 --> 00:26:44.803 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Others theorized that rooting
hedgehogs were

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:47.372 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the nocturnal artistes.

00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:50.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Those explanations were left
gasping for air when the

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:54.413 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
phenomenon evolved from
interesting circles into huge,

00:26:54.413 --> 00:26:57.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
cryptic agroglyphs Could
wind do this?

00:26:57.616 --> 00:27:00.719 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Could even the Picasso of
hedgehogs envision such a

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:02.154 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
masterwork?

00:27:02.154 --> 00:27:05.057 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-About half of us at a
particular moment saw little

00:27:05.057 --> 00:27:09.061 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
red darting lights in the wheat
fields near where some

00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:11.396 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of the crop circles
already existed.

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:14.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And these are commonly
reported phenomena.

00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:18.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-Balls of light, absolutely,
definitely.

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:21.640 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I have a couple of interviews
that I've taken on tape in

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.544 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
England where I've interviewed
people that saw balls of

00:27:25.544 --> 00:27:28.146 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
orange light that appeared over
areas where these circles

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:29.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
formed that night.

00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:32.985 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
From the descriptions that I
have heard, they've all been

00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:34.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
pretty consistent.

00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:37.456 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
75 to 80 foot diameter,
dish-shaped.

00:27:37.456 --> 00:27:39.625 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Classical flying saucer, if
you want to call it that.

00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:43.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Correlation is not
proof positive, but UFOs are

00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:45.430 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
seen over ranching
communities.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.599 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Mutilated animals
are then found.

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:50.536 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
UFOs are spotted by selective
witnesses.

00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:52.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Abduction memories emerge.

00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:55.974 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
UFOs are recorded above
ripened grain fields,

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:57.643 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
agroglyphs appear.

00:27:57.643 --> 00:28:00.279 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Something is happening.

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:03.248 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
For scientists like Marshall
Dudley, the evidence is clear

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:04.616 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
and abundant.

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:06.919 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Whatever is creating the crop
formations has the knowledge

00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:10.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and ability to tinker with
chemistry, genetics,

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:11.523 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
fundamental physics.

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:14.626 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
A tall order for brain
crunching hoaxsters.

00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-If you look at the areas where
this wilting is taking

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.232 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
place, you'll see
recrystallization, and it

00:28:20.232 --> 00:28:22.834 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
indicates that there has been
some elevated temperatures.

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:27.639 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The DNA has been blown apart,
to a large extent.

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:29.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
This is done through a

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:33.145 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
electrophoresis-type situation.

00:28:33.145 --> 00:28:34.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
You can't do this just

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:35.647 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
by stepping on it?

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:37.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
-No, you can't do it
by stomping it.

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:40.218 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And the other thing is that if
you tried to sprout the seeds

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:42.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that you would find that there
was a great number of

00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
mutations, which ties right
into the DNA damage.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.126 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Crop formations are
only one manifestation of the

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:49.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
higher stakes.

00:28:49.328 --> 00:28:52.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Sightings, landings,
abductions,

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:54.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
mutilations, messages.

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:56.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Is someone trying to
tell us something?

00:28:56.802 --> 00:28:58.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And if so, what is it?

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.138 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:18%
-This--

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:04.776 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This shift involves recognition
that we're utterly

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:06.845 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
not in control of the universe,
that there are

00:29:06.845 --> 00:29:11.249 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
intelligences that are far
greater than our own, that the

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:13.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
whole universe is itself
intelligent.

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:17.889 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This is a change in our sense of
the universe and ourselves,

00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:26.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which is far more radical than
any shift that I can recall,

00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:29.034 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and it is terrifying.

00:29:29.034 --> 00:29:31.269 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
-We have all grown
up being told or

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:33.271 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
taught that we are alone.

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:37.509 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We're alone on the planet, we're
alone in the galaxy.

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And I think that this story that
is emerging is showing us

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.347 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that that's not true.

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:43.715 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
We are not alone.

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:46.718 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
That there are alien life forms
who are coming here.

00:29:46.718 --> 00:29:49.721 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They are involved with our
animal life, our plant life,

00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:52.024 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
with us as a human species.

00:29:57.963 --> 00:30:02.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:21%
[mooing]

00:30:02.401 --> 00:30:05.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NARRATOR: If the cattle of
north Alabama seem a bit

00:30:05.003 --> 00:30:08.306 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
standoffish these days, consider
what's been happening

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:10.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to some of their kindred
cud chewers.

00:30:10.742 --> 00:30:15.914 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Between October 1992 and June
1993, close to 40 cattle in

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:19.284 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
two counties were somehow
immobilized, selectively

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:21.586 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
sliced up, and left to rot.

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:24.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Since many farmers decide to
bury the evidence without

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:27.759 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
filing reports, the true number
of cases could be twice

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:31.596 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
as high, and because the
mutilation coincided with UFO

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:34.900 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
sightings, clever headline
writers dubbed the killings

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.803 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
close encounters of
the herd kind.

00:30:37.803 --> 00:30:40.105 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
-Are you a suspect?

00:30:40.105 --> 00:30:42.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-I better be, because if I'm
not a suspect, they're not

00:30:42.641 --> 00:30:44.242 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
doing their job.

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:45.777 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
NARRATOR: The irony
isn't lost on

00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:47.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
police officer Ted Oliphant.

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:50.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He became the point man in the
cattle mutilation probe almost

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:54.352 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
by default, then found himself
among the suspects.

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:57.789 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Media accounts, spurred in part
by tips from rival law

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:01.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
men, gleefully revealed that
Oliphant once produced a video

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:05.464 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
documentary about UFOs before
he became a cop.

00:31:05.464 --> 00:31:08.500 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He's never said that UFOs might
be responsible for the

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.803 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
cow killings, but Oliphant
certainly alienated other

00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:15.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
agencies by insisting that their
predator explanation

00:31:15.407 --> 00:31:16.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
didn't cut it.

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:19.344 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-Right now, we have no
explanation for who or what is

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
doing these things
to these animals.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.516 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We've got no suspects, we've got
no evidence other than the

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:26.384 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
carcasses that are
left behind.

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:29.454 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We've got no eye witnesses,
and we have absolutely no

00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:31.823 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
motive for why people
would be doing this.

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:34.526 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Other investigators
belittled Oliphant work and

00:31:34.526 --> 00:31:36.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
his background, but he had
no such problems with the

00:31:36.995 --> 00:31:40.165 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
farmers, especially those
who'd been victimized.

00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:43.568 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
David McClendon felt insulted
when Sheriff's deputies told

00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:46.071 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
him his calf had been killed
by a predator.

00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:49.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, instead of burying the
carcass as he was told, he

00:31:49.674 --> 00:31:52.444 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
piled it into his pick up and
took it to Oliphant, who

00:31:52.444 --> 00:31:56.848 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
quickly pointed out the
unnatural incision pattern.

00:31:56.848 --> 00:32:01.686 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-Stair step-type incision along
one of the cut lines.

00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:05.857 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
It's just jagged
stair step all.

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:09.161 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Each step was approximately the
same, you know, size and

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:11.863 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
everything, much like
stair steps.

00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:14.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: The same sort of odd
cuts have been reported in the

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
hundreds of other mutilation
incidents.

00:32:16.635 --> 00:32:19.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Since the phenomenon first
gained national attention in

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:21.873 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the mid '60s with the slaughter
of a horse in

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:24.976 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Colorado, mutilation cases have
been reported in nearly

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:27.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
every state and dozens
of foreign countries.

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:30.415 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Cattle are the primary victims,
but many other

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:32.384 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
animals have also
been targeted.

00:32:32.384 --> 00:32:34.619 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
In Britain, an outbreak
of horse slayings

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:35.887 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
has shocked the public.

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:39.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In Canada, domestic cats
have been dissected.

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:42.894 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
David McClendon's so-called
stair step incisions, also

00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:46.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
known as cookie cutter or
pinking shear cuts have become

00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:47.532 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
all too familiar to

00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:49.901 align:middle line:79% position:75% size:61%
investigators around the
country.

00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:54.005 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-The cuts that were made up the
legs, on the inside of the

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:56.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
legs, and up the belly look like
you could have taken a

00:32:56.908 --> 00:32:59.444 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
zipper and zipped the cow right
back together again.

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:03.915 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And they were 1/8 serrated cuts
were made on the cow.

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:07.586 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We cut down into the animal and
found out that the ball

00:33:07.586 --> 00:33:11.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
joint was gone, completely
gone, off just in one

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:15.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
shoulder, and just a perfectly
flat cut inside.

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:17.963 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: In many other cases,
the phantom surgeons used

00:33:17.963 --> 00:33:21.299 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
straight lines, scalpel-sharp
cuts, and in others, the

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:24.269 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
cutters rely on something
akin to a laser.

00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:27.539 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-The tissue had been cooked,
subjected to high heat.

00:33:27.539 --> 00:33:28.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The blood had been cooked.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.810 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There were basophilia changes
that could only occur in the

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
presence of maybe 300, 350
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:40.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Well, since 1989, we now have
over a dozen animals that have

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:43.722 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
fallen to the category of these
mysterious mutilations

00:33:43.722 --> 00:33:47.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in which there's evidence that
high heat was applied to the

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:51.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
incisions that automatically
eliminates predator.

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:54.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: Even more chilling, in
a handful of instances, the

00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:57.569 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
killers managed to cut
between the cells of

00:33:57.569 --> 00:33:58.970 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
the animal's tissue.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:02.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-Some of the cuts, from whatever
use they're using,

00:34:02.507 --> 00:34:04.676 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
whether it's laser or
what, literally

00:34:04.676 --> 00:34:06.878 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
go between the cells.

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:08.813 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Now, we have no technology
that I know of

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:10.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that can even do that.

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:14.185 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: If we don't have such
technology, who does?

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:24.996 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
MAN (OFFSCREEN): It looks like
they were sealed at the time

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:30.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of cut, which would lead you
to believe that it possibly

00:34:30.135 --> 00:34:31.970 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
could have been a laser.

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:34.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: The unnerving
experience of finding a cow in

00:34:34.706 --> 00:34:37.842 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
this condition prompted many
Alabama farmers to start

00:34:37.842 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
packing guns.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.680 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Adding to the tension were
frequent appearances of

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.015 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
unmarked helicopters before and

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:46.017 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
after mutilation incidents.

00:34:46.017 --> 00:34:49.020 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
David McClendon saw one of the
mystery choppers hovering over

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
his property after the
death of his calf.

00:34:51.623 --> 00:34:55.360 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-We'd been home probably an hour
before it ever happened,

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.761 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
so we knew right when
it got here.

00:34:56.761 --> 00:34:57.929 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
INTERVIEWER: You grabbed
the hand gun.

00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:59.230 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I mean, what would
you have done?

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.699 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
-I'd have shot.

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:06.037 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I don't believe anybody's got
any business, you know, in a

00:35:06.037 --> 00:35:09.040 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
helicopter hovering
over my pasture.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.343 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Most people hear helicopters
and it's close to

00:35:11.343 --> 00:35:12.877 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
high tension wires.

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:15.447 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And high tension wires are just
right over there about 75

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:17.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
yards from here.

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:19.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I'd hate for somebody to be
flying around a helicopter and

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:25.223 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
have to land in the yard right
now, 'cause it wouldn't take

00:35:25.223 --> 00:35:27.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
off without the police
being out here.

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:29.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
NARRATOR: The connection between
unknown helicopters

00:35:29.094 --> 00:35:32.063 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and mutilation episodes all
across the country has been

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:35.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
studied for several years by
independent investigators like

00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:39.070 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Texan Tom Adams, and even
by the US Senate.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.706 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
No one knows where the choppers
are from or who is

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:43.074 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
flying them.

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:45.443 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Ted Oliphant suspects that,
whoever they are, they're

00:35:45.443 --> 00:35:48.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
monitoring the mutilations
just like he is.

00:35:48.313 --> 00:35:52.083 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Who they are, I really don't
know, but on the ground,

00:35:52.083 --> 00:35:54.085 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
before and after mutilations
have been

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:56.454 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
discovered by people.

00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:59.190 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In some cases, it almost seems
like we've been in a race with

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.092 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the helicopters to see
who can get to the

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:03.094 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
animal's carcass first.

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:06.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NARRATOR: In the spring of
1993, rival investigators

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:09.467 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
tried to put a lid on the
situation by urging victimized

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:11.302 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
ranchers to keep quiet.

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:14.105 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Oliphant responded by calling
a news conference.

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:17.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Facing a phalanx of journalists,
he introduced,

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:20.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
one by one, victimized farmers
who weren't buying the

00:36:20.412 --> 00:36:22.680 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
predator story.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-It's a pretty slap in the
taxpayers' face when we report

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:30.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
anything like this to law
enforcement officials and they

00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:34.659 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
come out and walk around the
animal and say, well, a

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:38.963 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
predator's done it, which
I know better than that.

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:40.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
NARRATOR: Oliphant
also released two

00:36:40.632 --> 00:36:42.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
independent lab reports.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.603 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
One showed evidence that a high
heat instrument was used

00:36:45.603 --> 00:36:47.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to cut up one cow.

00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:51.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Another analyzed and odd white
chemical found on a carcass,

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.645 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
an unnatural compound
which could serve as

00:36:53.645 --> 00:36:55.213 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
a cauterizing agent.

00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:57.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
State and county investigators
listened to the news

00:36:57.782 --> 00:37:00.151 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
conference, but declined to
defend their predator

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:02.120 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
hypothesis.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
-I can't--

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:04.856 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
can't make a comment.

00:37:04.856 --> 00:37:07.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In Alabama, as elsewhere, no
one has been able to crack

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:09.160 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
this riddle.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:13.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Suspects include the military,
big industry, the TVA, as well

00:37:13.198 --> 00:37:15.033 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
as cults and predators.

00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:17.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The evidence suggests that
whoever is behind it in

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:20.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Alabama and around the
world is very cagey.

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:23.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-We're talking about tens,
literally tens of thousands of

00:37:23.508 --> 00:37:26.845 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
cases, nationally
and worldwide.

00:37:26.845 --> 00:37:29.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
No one's ever been arrested,
nobody's ever been prosecuted,

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:31.049 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
no charges have ever
been brought

00:37:31.049 --> 00:37:32.250 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
against anybody for this.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
No one's ever been caught.

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:36.087 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NARRATOR: Journalist Linda
Howe insists that we must

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:38.223 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
follow the evidence, no
matter where it leads.

00:37:38.223 --> 00:37:41.559 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The correlation between
mutilations and UFOs is

00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:42.861 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
indisputable.

00:37:42.861 --> 00:37:45.196 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Everywhere there's one,
there's the other.

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:48.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
More importantly, there are only
a handful of instances in

00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:52.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which witnesses say they've seen
mutilations in progress.

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:55.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Their descriptions seemingly
defy all logic.

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:59.043 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
-You have to look to what
human testimony

00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:02.213 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
comes over 25 years.

00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:05.283 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Eye witnesses who say that
they've seen these small, gray

00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:09.254 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
creatures with these big black
eyes either carrying an animal

00:38:09.254 --> 00:38:12.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that's found mutilated or taking
an animal into some

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
kind of craft.

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:16.227 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It is an alien harvest.

00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:18.463 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-I think you've got to come
to a conclusion that we're

00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:22.667 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
dealing with an extremely high
technology that may be so far

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:26.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
beyond anything we can do here
that the only answer I can

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:29.207 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
come up with is there's some
alien involvement.

00:38:29.207 --> 00:38:32.644 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And some of the eye witnesses
have supported that view, that

00:38:32.644 --> 00:38:35.880 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
they have seen mysterious
ships, they have seen

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.250 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
mysterious, non-human
entities.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: One final disturbing
note about the mutilations,

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:45.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
namely, the genetic similarity
between cattle and humans.

00:38:45.957 --> 00:38:49.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
People and cattle share nearly
identical chromosomes.

00:38:49.294 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In addition, cows' blood is so
like ours that it's used to

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.799 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
produce human plasma.

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:57.835 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
This raises the eerie
possibility that whoever is

00:38:57.835 --> 00:39:00.605 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
chopping up cows is studying
them in order

00:39:00.605 --> 00:39:02.140 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to learn about us.

00:39:11.916 --> 00:39:15.019 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: One is being called
Zoosh, and he's just, like,

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
from everywhere.

00:39:16.287 --> 00:39:18.189 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But the [inaudible]

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
is one from Zeta Reticuli.

00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:21.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I like working with him.

00:39:21.392 --> 00:39:24.295 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Robert Shapiro is a
practitioner of the new age

00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:27.298 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
discipline known as channeling,
in which alien or

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:30.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
spirit entities speak to the
rest of us through mediums.

00:39:43.248 --> 00:39:45.250 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
-All right.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:45.883 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
[inaudible]

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:47.318 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:23%
speaking.

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:49.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
[inaudible].

00:39:49.821 --> 00:39:52.323 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I will respond to questions.

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:54.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Most people,
especially scientists, don't

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:56.327 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
give much credence
to channeling.

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:58.363 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Anyone who talks with
aliens on a regular

00:39:58.363 --> 00:40:00.331 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
basis must have a problem.

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:03.334 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It was the same back in the
1950s with the first of the

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:05.303 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
so-called contactees.

00:40:05.303 --> 00:40:08.339 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
People like George Adamski, who
claim to have taken rides

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
on space ships with Venusians.

00:40:10.675 --> 00:40:14.345 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
To the scientific community,
it's all one big mixed bag of

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:17.915 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
specious claims, and that bag
includes modern abduction

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:19.350 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
reports, which remain

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:79% position:73% size:63%
controversial even to UFO
circles.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.255 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-And there are people who will
swear on a stack of bibles

00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:26.724 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
that it's true.

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:29.727 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Well, I don't know if it's true
or not, but the evidence

00:40:29.727 --> 00:40:32.430 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in support of it is terribly,
terribly weak.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.867 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-My problem with the whole way
abductions are studied is that

00:40:35.867 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the hypnosis, very often,
hypnosis is used by people who

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:42.373 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
are not trained to do that.

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:47.712 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-Somewhere between 25% 35% or
whatever of all the abduction

00:40:47.712 --> 00:40:49.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
cases are remembered
without hypnosis.

00:40:49.747 --> 00:40:52.750 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And every abduction case,
virtually, people remember

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
pieces of it without hypnosis.

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:58.356 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
NARRATOR: Hopkins, perhaps more
than any other person,

00:40:58.356 --> 00:41:01.693 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
has risked all, including his
personal life and his health,

00:41:01.693 --> 00:41:04.796 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in order to convince the world
to sit up and take notice of

00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:06.197 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
abduction reports.

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:08.999 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Finally, his efforts appear
to be paying off.

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:11.669 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-The thing that makes the UFO
abduction phenomenon so

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:14.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
powerful in that shift
is that it kind of

00:41:14.272 --> 00:41:15.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
gets us where we live.

00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:18.409 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It enters the physical world,
it appears to be in the

00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:21.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
physical world, but once
having found us in the

00:41:21.446 --> 00:41:24.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
physical world, it then drags us
out of the physical world.

00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:25.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
So it is--

00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:28.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's like tailor made to shatter
the arrogance of the

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:30.421 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Western world view.

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:32.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Harvard psychiatrist
John Mack has taken

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:35.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
considerable heat from his
colleagues because of his

00:41:35.293 --> 00:41:38.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
interest in abduction cases,
but he's not deterred.

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:41.432 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Mack recognizes that many
scientists simply refuse to

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:44.435 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
believe abductions are
real, no matter what.

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:47.438 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-There's a huge amount of
physical evidence of what's

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:51.442 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
going on in the abduction UFO
world, but there has to be

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:56.447 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
some openness of the receiver
to that evidence.

00:41:56.447 --> 00:42:01.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It requires, as one Harvard said
that, well, one of the--

00:42:01.152 --> 00:42:02.653 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I have to have a cigarette
lighter that was

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:04.455 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
dropped from a UFO.

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:08.259 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Well, probably they gave up
smoking hundreds of thousands

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:13.264 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of years ago anyway, but that
kind of physical requirement.

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:15.466 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's exactly that mentality
that this

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:18.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
is shifting us beyond.

00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:20.438 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Dr. Mack's entrance
into the abduction debate

00:42:20.438 --> 00:42:23.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
makes it much tougher for
science to dismiss the subject

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:26.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
without looking at the data
first, though scientists who

00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:29.514 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
do investigate are often
amazed at the scope and

00:42:29.514 --> 00:42:32.049 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
similarity of abductee tales.

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:34.719 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-There were beings around me.

00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:38.523 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They were little, short beings,
but fairly chubby and

00:42:38.523 --> 00:42:40.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
heavy on the beings.

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:43.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And there was about four
or five of them.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.998 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And they were busy doing
different things as I was

00:42:46.998 --> 00:42:48.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
laying on the table.

00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:51.569 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Mary has had similar
experiences most of her life,

00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:53.704 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
so have other members
of her family.

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:55.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Therein lies the central
pattern of

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:57.175 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the abduction scenario.

00:42:57.175 --> 00:43:00.611 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It begins during childhood,
continues for decades, and

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:02.880 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
seems to follow entire
families.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.751 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-What I remember is just, like,
the bruises and stuff.

00:43:06.751 --> 00:43:09.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I always remember waking
up thinking that I'd been

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:11.923 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
somewhere but not knowing
where I had been.

00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:15.059 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But I remember seeing
flying saucers.

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:17.829 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Anderson has had a
lifetime of UFO sightings,

00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:22.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
abduction experiences, missing
time, and unexplained scars.

00:43:22.033 --> 00:43:24.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The same was true of her
mother and is now

00:43:24.168 --> 00:43:25.870 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
true for her daughter.

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:29.640 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-The basic patterns are so
narrowly similar, over and

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:34.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
over and over again, that they
simply preclude human fantasy

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:35.913 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
as having been the cause.

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:38.583 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-There's a very strong physical
component to this

00:43:38.583 --> 00:43:43.721 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
data that a person who is
abducted actually is missing

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.556 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
from their normal environment
during the abduction

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:49.093 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
experience and that people
have multiple abductions.

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:51.729 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There are people abducted
together at the same time who

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:53.264 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
confirm each other's
abductions.

00:43:53.264 --> 00:43:54.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And some of those people
may not be

00:43:54.565 --> 00:43:56.400 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
abducted themselves even.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.970 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And we have independent people
who see other people being

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
abducted, and their scars.

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:02.573 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
MAN (OFFSCREEN): [inaudible]
marks.

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:03.908 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:18%
-Right.

00:44:03.908 --> 00:44:05.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Scars on people's bodies and
all sorts of other things.

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.445 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And any theory to--

00:44:07.445 --> 00:44:10.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to-- that explains the abduction
phenomenon must take

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:14.585 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
into account the physical aspect
of it, and that is why

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
we don't have a competing theory
to the theory, in fact,

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.259 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that this is what's happening
to people.

00:44:21.259 --> 00:44:23.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Dr. Jacques Vallee
questions some abduction

00:44:23.628 --> 00:44:26.631 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
reports, because they were
recalled with hypnosis, but

00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:29.600 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
he's personally seen the
physical effects of alien

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.601 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
encounters.

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:32.603 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
-There is impact on
the-- on the skin.

00:44:32.603 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They do describe a hot
sensation, but the beam would

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.609 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
also pin them down
and push them.

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:40.945 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We don't know how to make
a beam that does that.

NARRATOR: Psychiatric social
worker John Carpenter is

00:44:43.314 --> 00:44:45.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
another professional who's dared
to look seriously at

00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:46.918 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
abductions.

00:44:46.918 --> 00:44:48.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
-You don't want to
live with that.

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:50.621 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It is not a fun experience.

00:44:50.621 --> 00:44:52.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: One of his case is
involved a Nevada ranging

00:44:52.957 --> 00:44:57.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
family, whose members have had
unusual encounters for years.

00:44:57.762 --> 00:45:00.798 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-One came up to my shoulder.

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:03.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And slender and dark eyed.

00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:05.703 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
MAN (OFFSCREEN): What
color hair?

00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:07.171 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:23%
-No hair.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.510 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Mean eyes?

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:13.544 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:16%
-Cold.

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It looks like a dentists
office.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.049 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
MAN (OFFSCREEN): And what makes
it looks like a dentists

00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:19.216 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:18%
office?

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:21.652 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
-Everything comes out
of the walls.

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:24.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:16%
Hoses.

00:45:24.355 --> 00:45:25.656 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I don't like it here.

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:29.894 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Are you aware
of how old you are?

00:45:29.894 --> 00:45:30.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:21%
-I'm 14.

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:33.197 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
MAN (OFFSCREEN): 14.

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:35.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NARRATOR: Susan had a reason
for being so certain of her

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.068 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
age at the time.

00:45:37.068 --> 00:45:38.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-Because they went between
my legs and

00:45:38.536 --> 00:45:40.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
nobody's ever done that.

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:43.040 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Nobody
had done that before?

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:11%
-No.

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:46.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
MAN (OFFSCREEN): No.

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:48.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Since you couldn't move, how
did they manage that?

00:45:51.983 --> 00:45:54.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
-I spread my legs.

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:56.187 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
-There is no doubt in
my mind there is a

00:45:56.187 --> 00:45:58.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
definite phenomenon occurring.

00:45:58.356 --> 00:46:03.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Some kind of intervention,
intrusion of some kind of

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:07.698 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
different type of being, whether
it's dimensional or

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:08.699 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
extraterrestrial.

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:11.102 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Whatever it is, there's nothing
that binds these

00:46:11.102 --> 00:46:16.273 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
people together except the
common amazing reports that

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.875 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
they come up with.

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:20.711 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Carpenter, Mack,
Jacobs, and Hopkins have been

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:23.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
taking their case to their
colleagues, holding seminars

00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:26.450 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
around the country for mental
health professionals, hoping

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:29.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to foster better understanding
of abductee reports.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.456 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The response has been modest,
but encouraging.

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:34.692 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Unfortunately there
are no answers to

00:46:34.692 --> 00:46:36.060 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
any of the big questions.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Why is this happening?

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:38.763 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
What do they want?

00:46:38.763 --> 00:46:40.798 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Where will it all lead?

00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:43.734 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
-It certainly is a good question
that, why do they

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:47.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
need us if they're
so advanced.

00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:52.476 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But then why do we need wildlife
to do our research?

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:56.180 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Why do we have 2,000 lab rats?

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:59.750 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Why don't we just create
our own animals?

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:03.754 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There has to be something to do
with our spirit, our soul,

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:07.558 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:28%
our brains.

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:09.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Something beyond, maybe,
what they can

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.228 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
manufacture in the lab.

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:13.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
-It seems like they're
interested also in a

00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:16.600 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
relationship with us, in some
kind of joining with us.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.770 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-We know infinitely more about
this-- infinitely more about

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.772 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it than we did 10 years ago.

00:47:21.772 --> 00:47:24.942 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But we still have major gaps in
our understanding because

00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:29.647 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we cannot put ourselves in the
minds of an alien intelligence

00:47:29.647 --> 00:47:33.484 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
with alien needs, non-human
needs, and understand why

00:47:33.484 --> 00:47:35.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they're doing, and why they're
choosing, and why they're

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
following people the way
they seem to be doing.

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:50.167 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:52.303 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Who among us hasn't
heard this cliche?

00:47:52.303 --> 00:47:55.973 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The universe is so vast, it
would be egotistical of us to

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:57.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
believe we're the only ones.

00:47:57.975 --> 00:48:00.211 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Like so many time worn
beliefs, this

00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:01.812 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
one misses the point.

00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:05.516 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The issue isn't whether life
exists elsewhere, but rather,

00:48:05.516 --> 00:48:09.320 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is that life visiting us, and
if so, for what purpose.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.822 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The assumption that UFOs
merely represent

00:48:11.822 --> 00:48:14.892 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
extraterrestrial civilizations,
people like us

00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:17.928 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
who just happen to live on other
planets, may also be

00:48:17.928 --> 00:48:19.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
overly simplistic.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.833 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The true picture of life in our
universe may be far more

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:26.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
complicated and more wondrous.

00:48:26.137 --> 00:48:30.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-They are describing phenomena
that objects that appear, very

00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:34.178 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
often out of nowhere, disappear
on the spot.

00:48:34.178 --> 00:48:36.113 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Objects that are changing
shapes,

00:48:36.113 --> 00:48:38.215 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
object that merge together.

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:41.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If the technology or the
phenomenon can do that, it--

00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:44.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
what that tells me is that it is
manipulating time and space

00:48:44.989 --> 00:48:49.093 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
dimensions in ways that are
beyond our science.

00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:50.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And if they can do that,
they can be from

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:52.229 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
anywhere, any time.

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:54.865 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They don't have to be from a
particular planet in outer

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:56.267 align:middle line:79% position:49% size:13%
space

00:48:56.267 --> 00:48:58.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Harvard's John Mack
agrees that the aliens may not

00:48:58.636 --> 00:49:00.037 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
be aliens at all.

00:49:00.037 --> 00:49:03.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They may live among us in some
sort of parallel world which

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.709 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
we do not yet understand.

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:09.780 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
-All of those sources of
information that tell us that

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:14.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the universe is not the
materially regular, well

00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:20.925 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
ordered machine that we like to
think it is, and that there

00:49:20.925 --> 00:49:26.564 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
are realms of reality that are
far beyond what we can touch

00:49:26.564 --> 00:49:30.601 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and measure with our restricted
empirical tools.

00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:33.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: For most scientists,
still rooted in the mindset of

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:36.907 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the 17th century, such concepts
are preposterous.

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:39.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If something can't be physically
measured, then it

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:43.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
can't exist, meaning there are
no souls, no human spirit, no

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:46.617 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
God, no alien worlds.

00:49:46.617 --> 00:49:48.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
747s are flying over
the outback of

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:50.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Australia every day.

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:52.556 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And the Aborigines look up, and
none of them have a piece

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:56.827 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of one, but they know
what they're seeing.

00:49:56.827 --> 00:50:01.131 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
These things are there, and
the evidence is enormous.

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:03.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
NARRATOR: Proof is whatever it
takes to convince us that

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
something is true.

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:07.938 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
On the subject of UFOs, there
is more than enough evidence

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:11.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to prove that something really
is going on, but none of it

00:50:11.442 --> 00:50:13.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
means anything to a person
who simply refuses

00:50:13.978 --> 00:50:15.679 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to take a fair look.

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:18.115 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
UFOs have been around
a long time.

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:20.017 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Millions of people
over thousands of

00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:21.485 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
years have seen them.

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
For centuries, they've
been captured in

00:50:23.287 --> 00:50:25.022 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
carvings and drawings.

00:50:25.022 --> 00:50:28.225 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Today, they're seen
in photos, videos,

00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:30.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
films, and radar images.

00:50:30.995 --> 00:50:34.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
UFOs can and do affect
our cars,

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:36.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
planes, and other machinery.

00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:39.336 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Thousands of landing site traces
have been recorded.

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:42.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Soil has been baked,
burned, irradiated.

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:45.976 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Mystical crop formations appear
overnight all over the

00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:49.647 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
world, with changes in the
crops' genetic structure.

00:50:49.647 --> 00:50:52.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Humans who encounter alien
beings report being taken from

00:50:52.983 --> 00:50:56.387 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
their homes, probed, their
memories altered, and they

00:50:56.387 --> 00:51:00.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
often carry away marks, scars,
and other physical signs.

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:03.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Animals are being harvested by
some unseen force, and for

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:05.996 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
some unknown purpose.

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:08.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Governments the world over
possess secret files which

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:13.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
declare flat out that UFOs
are real and are here.

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:16.173 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If someone is simply unwilling
to consider the possibility of

00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:19.143 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
other life forms, then none
of this means much.

00:51:19.143 --> 00:51:22.846 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But for the open minded, there
is evidence to pursue.

00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:24.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
-I think that this
is a solvable

00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:25.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
problem at this point.

00:51:25.783 --> 00:51:31.155 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We are poised, now, to answer
these fundamental questions.

00:51:31.155 --> 00:51:33.757 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
After half a century of dealing
with this subject, we

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:37.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
are now in a position to
actually solve this mystery.

00:51:37.394 --> 00:51:41.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-If this is some kind of an
alien life form that is coming

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:45.569 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
here and is doing this, why
isn't it incumbent upon every

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:49.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
one of us to try to understand
more, to try to understand

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:55.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
why, and perhaps even ask of
explanation from our own

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:57.448 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
government about
their silence?

00:51:57.448 --> 00:51:59.817 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
NARRATOR: Those who choose to
study the genesis of this

00:51:59.817 --> 00:52:03.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
phenomenon often pay a high
price, Budd Hopkins' work cost

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:07.291 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
him a marriage and is held, John
Mack has faced scorn and

00:52:07.291 --> 00:52:09.493 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
ridicule from his colleagues.

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:12.830 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Brian O'Leary was ostracized by
his former friends in the

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:14.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
astronaut world.

00:52:14.298 --> 00:52:16.934 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Linda Howe and others
have been spied upon

00:52:16.934 --> 00:52:18.769 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
by government agents.

00:52:18.769 --> 00:52:21.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Ted Oliphant had to quit his
job as a police officer and

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:23.140 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
left Alabama.

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:26.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The price can be high, but
so can the rewards, as we

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.813 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
grudgingly strive to understand
a cosmos that is

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:33.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
far more mysterious than
we ever imagined.

00:52:33.117 --> 00:52:36.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-We're dealing with
extraterrestrial beings, we're

00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:38.655 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
dealing with interdimensional
beings, we're dealing with

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:42.092 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
phenomena that go in and out
of our physical reality and

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:44.762 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
are right on the fringes of
our physical reality.

00:52:44.762 --> 00:52:48.565 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We're dealing with a technology
in which, let's

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:53.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
say, mind is supreme
over matter.

00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:56.173 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
-The animal mutilations
are real.

00:52:56.173 --> 00:52:57.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
They happen.

00:52:57.741 --> 00:53:00.044 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
They're reported.

00:53:00.044 --> 00:53:02.112 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Human abductions
are happening.

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:04.114 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
They're reported.

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:07.284 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We're sitting at a time at a
crossroads as we're going into

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:11.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
this next century where I
believe firmly that the next

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:15.626 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
big story is going to
be contact from

00:53:15.626 --> 00:53:19.163 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
something else out there.

00:53:19.163 --> 00:53:22.163 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
