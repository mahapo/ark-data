00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I am Raymond Moody.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And these are my thoughts
on visionary encounters

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.750 align:middle line:84%
with the spirits of
departed loved ones.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:10%
It is a common human experience
after the death of a loved

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:10%
one for people to have some
sort of significant message

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:10%
from the departed person.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are several
variants of this.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Some people will say that in the
middle of the day when they're

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:84%
in full waking
consciousness, the apparition

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
of the departed person will
just appear in their home.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Other people will say
that they experience

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:84%
an apparition of the
deceased loved one

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:84%
while they are lying in
bed on the verge of sleep.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Not asleep, but kind of
in that drifty situation.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:84%
They see the apparition standing
often at the foot of the bed.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And a third type in which
people will say that--

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
they have to call this a
dream, because it was--

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:84%
they were asleep
when it occurred,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
but that it didn't have
the quality of a dream.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It actually seemed
to be a visitation

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:90%
with a departed loved one.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So those are the three
main ways of people

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:84%
receiving communications
from dead relatives.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.480 align:middle line:84%
In our world, this
happens spontaneously.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.420 align:middle line:84%
But in the ancient
Greek and Roman worlds,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:84%
there were ways of actually
bringing these experiences

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So they had institutions
where people

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
would go to have
visionary encounters

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:90%
with their departed loved ones.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Burial sites have been
found from 40,000 years

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:84%
ago or longer, which showed
that even at that time,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:84%
people felt that there
was another world.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:10%
Now, so there's really no way of
putting a precise date on when

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.620 align:middle line:10%
these things came about.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be part
of human nature.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:84%
But even then the earliest
writings that we have--

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:84%
in the writings of the
Greek civilization,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
for example, there are accounts
of people seeing apparitions

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
It's part and parcel
of human nature.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
In 1991, I saw my
deceased grandmother

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:84%
as vividly as I have
seen any other person.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I felt her presence.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.065 align:middle line:90%
I heard her voice.

00:02:58.065 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, I'm
still startled by that.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't
deny my experience.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:90%
It was completely real to me.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
When people have an
apparition of the deceased,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
they often describe

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.360 align:middle line:90%
is how natural it seems.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I think if you're just
sitting abstractly and saying

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:84%
that Aunt Ruth had a
visit from Aunt Jane

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.020 align:middle line:84%
last night, that you would think
that that must be something

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
totally extraordinary and
out of the order of anything

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:90%
we experience.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But what people say is, no,
this is completely natural.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:84%
The naturalness of it is one
thing that people experience.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And I can talk about that
from my own experience,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.770 align:middle line:84%
that I realized full well
that my grandmother was dead.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I could
have abstractly realized

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
that there is something very
paradoxical in that situation.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the encounter
that I had with my grandmother,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:90%
it was completely natural.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Because number one, it was like
all her neuroses were gone.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
It's like she acknowledged
them in some way

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
that that's how I used to be,
with a little bit of humor

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.210 align:middle line:84%
in her eyes, but
also that that's

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:90%
something she left behind.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:90%
And so it was just--

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I was talking with my
grandmother, and she was dead.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And I was completely awake.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And another very
odd thing about it

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.490 align:middle line:84%
was that when I
looked at her, she

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.140 align:middle line:84%
looked like just
a physical person,

00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:00.570 align:middle line:84%
except that there was a
light just around her.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Not like a light that I
would experience here.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's very vibrant
energy emanation

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.325 align:middle line:84%
and that in a way that
I can't very just--

00:05:14.325 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I can't describe very well.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It was like she was
indented, right?

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:84%
That she was pushed back
from the physical framework

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:10%
And that that's what I
was seeing as this energy

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:10%
line and such that
in our conversations,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.900 align:middle line:10%
she revealed something to me
that I had not known about,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:10%
but makes perfect sense.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.160 align:middle line:84%
It really made my
life fit together.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no way
now of verifying this.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I just woke up and,
whoa, yes, that must be true.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And so it happened
a couple of times

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.850 align:middle line:84%
during this encounter that
unconsciously almost--

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.900 align:middle line:84%
just like you would want
to go hug your grandmother.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody
likes to be hugged.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But my grandmother was a person
who-- hugging was OK with her.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But each time when
I would approach her

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:90%
like this instinctively--

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:84%
whereas throughout the rest
of this, she was very verbal.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:84%
When I would lean
forward to hug her,

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:84%
she would throw her
hands up like this.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Stand back.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And instead of saying
something, would just

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.097 align:middle line:90%
nod her head like that.

00:06:27.097 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to make
any inference about that.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I know that I was in a complete
state of conscious awareness.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't under the
influence of any kind

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:10%
of extraneous compound.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I've had an apparition
of my grandmother, which

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm still trying to process
almost 30 years later.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I have talked over the
years with hundreds

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
of people with apparitions of
the deceased to describe to me.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And I can't find any
common feature around them.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's people
of every different kind

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.310 align:middle line:84%
of personality types,
male and female.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:84%
There's any kind of
socio-economic group

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:90%
you can think of.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And that people who haven't
had such experiences

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:84%
are very anxious to push it
away or not think about it.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm in a
situation where I just

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
can't understand why
some people don't

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:84%
like to face the reality and
unknowableness of the world.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:10%
To me, it's just a
wonderful part of the world

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:10%
that it's so mysterious,
and I can't figure it out.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that can't be
anything other than fear.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And the hundreds of
people I've talked with,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
with apparitions
of the deceased--

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.200 align:middle line:84%
there just aren't any common
factors that stand out.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.140 align:middle line:84%
These are people from
every walk of life,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and at every educational
level, and all kind

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:84%
of equally astonished by what
happened to them and inspired.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:10%
And so I would be
really surprised

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:10%
to say that there is some--

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:10%
if somebody were
to find that there

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:10%
is some unified feature of all
people who have apparitions.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:84%
It certainly is not
consonant with my experience.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
I got to admit--
and it's something

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm uncomfortable
about myself with,

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's the way I
am, is that I probably

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:84%
am too harsh on my assessment
of people who believe things

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:90%
or think things, right?

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is
unpleasant of me in a way.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But I can honestly
tell you, when

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I first heard about these
things like hauntings

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and so on, my attitude
was that, well,

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
this is a histrionic
person and so on.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, now-- had
a good friend who

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:84%
spent much of his life
investigating hauntings.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And he was just a really
good, wonderful guy.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.940 align:middle line:90%
And in 1985--

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
August of 1985, we

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:84%
were at the American
Psychological Association

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:90%
meeting in Washington.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And we were giving
presentations.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And so my friend Bill
said to me, well,

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Raymond, I'm going
up to New Jersey

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:90%
to investigate a haunting.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And he said, would you
come along to assist?

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, sure.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:90%
I'll be happy to.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And he said that his--

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:84%
the way his method was that
I couldn't know anything

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:84%
about the haunting before
I got there, right?

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't discuss
it on the way up.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle line:90%
The routine was that I--

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
when we arrived at
the house, the family

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.420 align:middle line:84%
would be gone to
another location,

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:90%
and nobody else would be there.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And Bill would go to
the other location

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and interview them about
the occurrences, OK?

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And that my assignment
was to sit there

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
in the house and just record
anything that I thought of.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And so as God as my witness,
what happened was this presence

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.780 align:middle line:90%
came through.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:10%
And it was not that I saw
anything with my eyes.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But I could describe this
as a visual experience.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.145 align:middle line:84%
But even though I knew it
wasn't coming through my eyes--

00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and I also knew it
wasn't imagination.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:90%
This is not imagination.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:10%
It was kind of electrical
for want of a better term.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And when this
person came through,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:90%
my sense was of an old man, OK?

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And when this thing would
take steps, in my mind

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:84%
not like it's an
auditory exactly,

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.395 align:middle line:84%
but as a sort of halfway thing--
was like a whoom, whoom, whoom,

00:11:41.395 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:90%
whoom, whoom.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And it went through like this,
like a semicircle around me

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.820 align:middle line:90%
out-- up here.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, here is-- number
one, I am a chicken.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I am terrified of
a lot of stuff.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't one bit scared.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it was because I
was there as an investigator,

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't trying
to scare myself

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.030 align:middle line:90%
with a haunted house story.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So then the next thing that
happened was this little girl.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I saw a very vivid
image of a little girl's face

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:84%
about the age of 12, blond
hair, and a blue something.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:90%
Not a dress, but--

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and it was like she was trying
to expel me or something,

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.320 align:middle line:90%
like to push me out.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, a little time passed.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard what's coming
from upstairs like footsteps

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:90%
on the upper floor.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And again-- I mean,
this sounds so out

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:84%
of character for a chicken,
but I just went up there

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:90%
and seeing nothing.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Nothing, OK?

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, after a while,
Bill came home.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:90%
And let's put it this way.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:84%
The family situation was
totally different from what

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.470 align:middle line:90%
I had imagined.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.525 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the woman
who owned the house--

00:13:00.525 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
her husband was a very eminent
neuroscientist whose work that

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I had studied in
medical school--

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:90%
number one.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:10%
Number two, the other
people in the family

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:10%
were very distinguished
in their professions.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:10%
I probably shouldn't
be too revealing,

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.310 align:middle line:10%
but just a very
distinguished artist, OK?

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:90%
And then there were the--

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.080 align:middle line:84%
now, we get to
talking about what

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.030 align:middle line:90%
they had been experiencing.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:10%
And the experience was of
an old man and of a girl

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.680 align:middle line:10%
about 12 years old,
that that's what they

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:10%
had been seeing and hearing.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And there was a conflict
between these two.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, as the story unfolds, when
did these disturbances start?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.040 align:middle line:84%
They started a day after the
younger woman and the family

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:90%
filed for a divorce.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, you see, I am not a
believer in paranormal things,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.180 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know
what belief means.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But I can describe
to you my experience

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and swear to God that
that's what I experienced.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I hear from
other people who've

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:90%
investigated similar things.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:90%
And I have no idea what this is.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you that that
was my honest experience

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:90%
that I went through.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:10%
And I should also say that the
disturbance between the older

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:44.560 align:middle line:10%
man and the young
girl exactly reflected

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:10%
the dynamics of
the family, which

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:10%
had brought about the divorce.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, what in the name
of God is going on here?

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like because
a psychiatrist--

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
really, I guess to
be a psychiatrist

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and the whole sense
of the thing that you

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:84%
have got to be taking
account not just of this one

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:09.130 align:middle line:84%
level of reality, but of
other levels of reality

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:90%
that we can hardly even imagine.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:84%
I would say that probably very
little in any of my education

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:24.000 align:middle line:84%
really helps me understand
this haunting I experienced.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:32.900 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that there are
other layers of reality

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:84%
that are sort of
interpenetrating

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.190 align:middle line:90%
this one we're in.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm beginning to see ways
where we could think logically

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:84%
about what I would say would
be interdimensional transport

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.822 align:middle line:84%
or like transition into
some other reality.

00:15:50.822 --> 00:15:54.680 align:middle line:90%
But it's-- I'm not there yet.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think I'm a lot
further than I was, say,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:90%
10 years ago or 20 years ago.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I can feel a progression
in this to the point

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
where I would have said 30 years
ago that the rational proof

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:84%
of an afterlife is not
going to occur certainly

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.796 align:middle line:90%
within my lifetime.

00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's probably still true.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:84%
However, I do feel that
there are new means

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
to think about this, so that a
rational proof of an afterlife

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.906 align:middle line:90%
may be possible.

00:16:35.906 --> 00:16:39.398 align:middle line:90%
That's where I see this heading.

00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:90%
A scientific method is very--

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:84%
it involves techniques
of verification,

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
and confirmation,
and disconfirmation

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:84%
that we just don't have yet
with near-death experiences

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:90%
and apparitions of the deceased.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't
have any clear way

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
to go from somebody's story
or narrative about something,

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:84%
however impressive
that narrative

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:84%
may be to us, to some sort
of definitive conclusion

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:84%
about some other
dimension of reality.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:84%
But see, that's
where the action is,

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:84%
is because if there
is life after death,

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.660 align:middle line:84%
that means people go through
some interdimensional

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:90%
transport, right?

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:84%
That they go from one
state of existence

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:84%
to some other
state of existence.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But nothing in our
logic right now

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
tells us how that
could be possible

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.860 align:middle line:90%
or how we could talk about it.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.845 align:middle line:84%
But I think that that's
about to be solved.

00:17:35.845 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the fundamental
institutions

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Greek civilization
were called oracles of the dead

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:90%
where people could travel.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And they could experience
vivid, lifelike apparitions

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:90%
of their departed loved ones.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
important for the history

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:90%
of Western philosophy.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.470 align:middle line:10%
Because at the time,
even of Socrates,

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.780 align:middle line:10%
the average great
person thought that

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.710 align:middle line:10%
what a philosopher was, was a
person who, number one, got out

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.640 align:middle line:10%
of his body and flew into
the heavens or number two,

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:10%
called up the
spirits of the dead.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And what this was all about
was these oracles of the dead.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:90%
And you could go there and--

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:84%
take you through a technique
where you would actually

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:84%
seem to see and converse
with your dead relatives.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.685 align:middle line:84%
And when I first read
about this was in 1962.

00:18:30.685 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:84%
I was 18 years old, and I
read about it in "Herodotus."

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking I was
so disappointed by Herodotus

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.600 align:middle line:84%
because, how could
he fall for this?

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.860 align:middle line:84%
This guy went and saw his
dead wife or whatever.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:10%
Well, then in about 1985,
I was reading an article

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:10%
about the rediscovery and
excavation of the most famous

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:10%
of the oracles of the
dead, the one that

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.330 align:middle line:10%
was described in Homer's
"Odyssey," for example,

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:10%
but also in "Herodotus."

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
described this.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And what the
archaeologists found

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.750 align:middle line:84%
was this vast underground
complex with dormitory rooms.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.980 align:middle line:84%
People would stay down there
apparently for four weeks.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.570 align:middle line:90%
There would be preparation.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:84%
You would be in
complete darkness.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:90%
They had a very specific diet.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And no doubt you would be
talking with the guides

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:34.910 align:middle line:90%
about your dead relative.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And on the last
day, you would have

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:84%
to go through a very narrow
little entrance, way down

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
a long corridor in
complete darkness,

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and crawl down through
a space, and enter

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:84%
into this room that was
maybe about 50, 60-feet long.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And in this room, they found the
remnants of an enormous bronze

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:90%
cauldron.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was surrounded
by a sort of banister

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.300 align:middle line:84%
that indicated when people saw
the visions of the deceased,

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:84%
they were looking in the
direction of the cauldron.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And there were carbon marks
on this subterranean chamber,

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.270 align:middle line:84%
indicating there
were torches there.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:90%
So it was torch light.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
read that detail,

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I knew number one,
what they were doing,

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
but also number two,
that it would work.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I'm
not contradicting

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:90%
the archaeologist.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Some years later, I
went and I met him.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And I described my
alternate take on it.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.590 align:middle line:90%
And I saw the aha.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I said, ah.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And then he gave me further
evidence that I was right.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:90%
But what this is all about--

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:44.090 align:middle line:84%
when you gaze into what is
called an optical, clear depth,

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.640 align:middle line:90%
it could be like a crystal ball.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:10%
It could be like a
body of clear water.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.240 align:middle line:10%
Or it could be a
polished bowl filled

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.520 align:middle line:10%
with olive oil and water.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Or it could just be a mirror
arranged in such a way

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.070 align:middle line:84%
that you don't see
reflections in it,

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
but nonetheless, that
it's illuminated.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And under those circumstances
when you gaze into this depth,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:90%
many people will see visions.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you have a
conscious control of it.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:90%
They just seem to appear.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:90%
And these are very lifelike.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:90%
They're full color.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.170 align:middle line:90%
They're dimensional.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:90%
They're very vivid.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.185 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as I
saw that detail, I

00:21:25.185 --> 00:21:26.690 align:middle line:90%
said, well, that's what it was.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I just set up
a mirror room in my home.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.710 align:middle line:84%
The mirror is mounted
on a wall in such a way

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:84%
that it's above
the line of sight.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So the person sitting
below just looks up.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't see their
own reflection.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a darkened room.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
little light behind,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:84%
so that when the person
turns on the light

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:84%
in this darkened room, the
room is diffusely illuminated.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the mirror,
but it's like a depth.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:90%
You don't see any reflections.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, the preparation
process is very simple.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I got 10 subjects who
were my graduate students

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:90%
in psychology.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Most of them were older.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And they had been out
and had some experience.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And also, as word spread,
my medical colleagues

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and psychologist colleagues
wanted to try it, too.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:84%
But my emphasis here
is this was curiosity.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:84%
What we were-- we
were just trying

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:90%
to find out if this works.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Basically, this was the
technique I figured out.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:90%
I asked them-- each one.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want you to
choose one person who died

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.790 align:middle line:90%
that you would like to see.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
come to my place

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.350 align:middle line:90%
10 o'clock in the morning.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:84%
This would be one
on one all day.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And I would spend an hour or two
with them just basically saying

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:84%
like, tell me about
this person who died.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:90%
What was this person like?

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Then you just let them
talk as long as they will.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Then you come back with a
slightly less open-ended

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
What are some of your
fondest memories?

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.110 align:middle line:90%
Let them talk until they will.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Then, what are some of the
hang-ups in their relationship

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:90%
that you regret and so on?

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is just to talk
about the person who died.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I would escort
them into this little room.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And I would put
them in the chair.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And I would say just
get very relaxed,

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and let all these feelings and
thoughts go through your mind,

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:90%
and gaze away into the mirror.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, I'm
going to leave you in here

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:90%
about an hour, hour and a half.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Say it very casually.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And if when I come back
something is going on,

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:38.090 align:middle line:84%
you just shoo me away and
come out whenever you want.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And then when I would
go in and retrieve them,

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.150 align:middle line:84%
then I would spend an
hour or two or more

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.140 align:middle line:84%
afterward just like processing
what they went through.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.280 align:middle line:90%
And I set this up.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And my thought was, well,
if I do 50 of these,

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.940 align:middle line:90%
I'll probably get 5 or so cases.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:90%
And I can write a little paper.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:10%
And I felt certainly that since
these were my psychologist

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:10%
students or my
medical colleagues who

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.260 align:middle line:10%
had studied about the mind,
that if anything happened,

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.430 align:middle line:10%
they would say something like,
oh, yeah, I saw this image.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:90%
It looked like my grandma.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But was it real
or was it a fake?

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:90%
That was what I expected.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Imagine my surprise when the
first person I put in there--

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:28.040 align:middle line:84%
44 years old, a very
distinguished alcohol rehab

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
counselor, just a
very grounded person

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:84%
came and prepared all day
to see her husband who

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.970 align:middle line:90%
had died two years before.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:84%
But she came out of
there astonished.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, I
didn't see my husband,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.810 align:middle line:84%
but my father showed up and
stepped out of the mirror.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.480 align:middle line:84%
She said the first thing
she saw was like in there--

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.530 align:middle line:84%
but then her father came forward
and emerged from the mirror.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And so Randy was this
girl's name-- lady's name.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.420 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, well--

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:84%
assuming that it
would be dreamlike.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.530 align:middle line:84%
But I was astonished
she said no.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.550 align:middle line:90%
This was really my father.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:10%
And that was the reaction
I got from everybody

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:10%
I took through there, that
no matter how psychologically

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:10%
informed they were, they
took this to be a real event.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:90%
So I did about 10 or 15.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I finally did-- well,
I'm going to try this myself,

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.650 align:middle line:84%
thinking that
there's no way that I

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:29.340 align:middle line:84%
would be fooled to think
that this is anything

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.010 align:middle line:90%
other than a figment.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.965 align:middle line:84%
But I had this very vivid
experience with my grandmother.

00:25:34.965 --> 00:25:37.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to make of it.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:43.770 align:middle line:10%
So it's astonishing to me
that this was so well known

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:48.090 align:middle line:10%
to the Greeks, that it
was practiced continuously

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.840 align:middle line:10%
for a period of at
least 1,500 years.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:10%
We don't know how long
it had been going on

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:10%
before that we had the
records, but that it

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:10%
was part of the
Western civilization,

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.560 align:middle line:10%
that the early great
philosophers who founded

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:10%
everything knew about this.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.210 align:middle line:90%
And some of them practiced it.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happened, I gather,

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:16.050 align:middle line:84%
was that up to about 400
BC, this was well known.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But then there was
some church council

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
that came around
and struck this out,

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:84%
but that it still has
manifested occasionally.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, people
find out about it.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea
what the ultimate role

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
of the mirror or the reflective
surface is, except maybe just

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to alter one's
consciousness, to put one

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.830 align:middle line:84%
into an altered state
of consciousness

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:84%
where one is more
receptive to this.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't necessarily
have to be a mirror.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.210 align:middle line:84%
There are other ways
of doing this as well.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:01.200 align:middle line:84%
One is known as the dream
incubation method, which

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I know of this existing in
the 15th century in Europe,

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:12.280 align:middle line:84%
because Paracelsus
describes this method.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But what it involves is that
you write a letter to your loved

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:90%
one who died.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And you pour out your
feelings and your questions.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you fold it up, and
you put it under your mattress,

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:90%
and you forget about it.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, this brings
about these vivid visions

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:84%
of the deceased
during the nighttime.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.470 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient world,
there was a culture

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:45.600 align:middle line:84%
in North Africa that practiced
this in their funeral rituals.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Herodotus writes about them.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody in
the tribe would die,

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.130 align:middle line:84%
they would create
a tomb for them.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.090 align:middle line:84%
But it would be a tomb with a
sleeping chamber at the top,

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.520 align:middle line:84%
so that if you had an
issue with grandma,

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:84%
then you would just go
out into the graveyard,

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and you would
sleep on her grave.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And during the night,
as we can well imagine,

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:84%
she would appear
to you and so on.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.550 align:middle line:84%
But psychologically,
it makes sense.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Grief, I think personally,
is probably the most pain

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.410 align:middle line:90%
that anybody can experience.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So the natural thing
that people want

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.110 align:middle line:84%
to happen when a
loved one died is

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that they want to
see that person again

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.520 align:middle line:90%
and to have a reunion.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And so in that
sense of the longing

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:84%
for a contact with a loved
one makes perfect sense.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And then so therefore,
you can well

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.040 align:middle line:84%
understand why the oracles
of the dead were so popular.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:84%
The archeology of
these sites show

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that they were constantly
visited, because we just

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.950 align:middle line:90%
have a great longing.

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Mediumship and evocation
of the deceased

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:84%
through mirrors and such are two
entirely different processes.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:04.900 align:middle line:84%
One, because the medium is by
definition a medium, right?

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Like an intermediary,
whereas people

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:84%
who have the psychomanteum
visits or mirror images--

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.540 align:middle line:84%
it's their direct
personal experience.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Somebody may help them
get into that state.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:84%
But once they are
in that state, they

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:25.460 align:middle line:84%
have their own
personal experience.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that brings people

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
to me to go through these
evocations of the deceased

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.360 align:middle line:90%
is grief.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.390 align:middle line:84%
However, there's a lot
more to it than that.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
who are grieving

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.570 align:middle line:84%
would never even consider going
to some psychiatrist house

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.720 align:middle line:90%
to sit in a room with a mirror.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:90%
So there are other things.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.440 align:middle line:10%
And I think that one
thing that motivates

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.950 align:middle line:10%
people to come to me to
go through this procedure

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:54.000 align:middle line:10%
is curiosity.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Like me, they are people
who are just driven to know.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.400 align:middle line:90%
What is this life all about?

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's so mystifying.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And some of our
fellow humans seem

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:84%
to try to deal with this
by contracting and not

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:90%
asking questions.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.420 align:middle line:90%
And I see that kind of person.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.100 align:middle line:10%
And I wonder, how
does that feel inside?

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Because to me,
it's the curiosity

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.640 align:middle line:90%
of such a driving force to me.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's one thing that
brings people to want to know

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.580 align:middle line:90%
about apparitions and so on.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.930 align:middle line:90%
It's just curiosity.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:32.230 align:middle line:84%
What does happen to us when
we die, if anything at all?

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Where I have come to this is
very far from the first idea

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I had when I was a kid,
but really the same idea.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just the strangest thing.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Because long before I
got into the afterlife,

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this world was
really strange and that

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:90%
inexplicable.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And with no religious background
and just my only experiencing

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.580 align:middle line:90%
of it being in my dance--

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:04.250 align:middle line:84%
"New Yorker" magazine
cartoons with the angels.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought
it was a joke.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was
18, first finding out

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.330 align:middle line:84%
that some people took
this question seriously

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and going through
a process, where

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:19.850 align:middle line:84%
it's totally counter-intuitive
to me to this day.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:22.030 align:middle line:10%
But here I am at 74.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And the closest thing I can
say to you is I give up.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Because when the doctors start
empathically co-participating

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.190 align:middle line:84%
in their patients'
near-death experiences,

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm past my pay grade on trying
to figure that out, right?

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:42.460 align:middle line:84%
To me, it seems that
the best I can do

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.990 align:middle line:84%
is to say, well, to my utter
astonishment there appears

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:50.110 align:middle line:90%
to be a life after death.

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still rebelling
against it when I say it.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Because, yeah, most people
seem to think-- or they say,

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.130 align:middle line:84%
oh, everybody wants
there to be an afterlife.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether I want
there to be an afterlife

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.730 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's only when I got
to thinking about this

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.430 align:middle line:84%
after I'd sort of made up my
mind that apparently there

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:15.280 align:middle line:84%
is, it's not a very entirely--
an inviting or pleasant

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.910 align:middle line:84%
prospect for me to think
that there is an afterlife.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I had gotten reconciled
and away from my background

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.200 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of, yeah,
life is a time limited

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:84%
experience, like a beginning,
and a middle, and an end.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And there is a certain
aesthetic appeal to that, see?

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:37.870 align:middle line:84%
But now, because of things
like the doctors telling me

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:84%
that they talked to their
patients' dead wives

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:46.000 align:middle line:84%
in the operating
room, I give up.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I was on the wrong
track about that.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.700 align:middle line:84%
But now, I don't have any way
to put all this together yet.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.710 align:middle line:90%
It's just that it's--

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I can stutter when
I say the words.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, there is
an afterlife and still

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:90%
a big surprise to me.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.020 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:90%
