00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I am Raymond Moody.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And these are my thoughts
on shared death experiences.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:10%
Very commonly at the scene
where somebody is dying

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:10%
and the family members are
assembled around the bed,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:10%
as the person in
the bed passes away,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.690 align:middle line:10%
the bystanders themselves
have experiences

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:10%
that are identical
to those that are

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.870 align:middle line:10%
reported to us by people
who are resuscitated

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:10%
after almost dying.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.090 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
bystander may say

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:84%
that as the person
in the bed dies,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle line:84%
they see something
leave the body.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is very often
described as a light,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:84%
like a globular,
grayish, golden light.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I hear this very often from
physicians, for example.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:84%
The other people
at the bedside may

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:84%
say that as the individual
in the bed dies,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:84%
the bystander
themselves say that they

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:90%
leave their physical bodies.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And they feel that they go
part way with their dying loved

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:90%
one toward this light.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And then at a
certain point, they

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
come back and rejoin their body,
and their loved one goes on.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Or people may say that
as the person dies,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
the light fills the room, like
this amazing bright light.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Or people will say that
they see apparitions

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
of the dying person's
dead relatives and friends

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:84%
come into the room as though to
escort the dying person away.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And another very
common thing I hear

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.850 align:middle line:84%
is that the geometry of
the room shifts in some way

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that they find
impossible to describe.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I hear people say, for
example, that they suddenly

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:84%
realize that they were looking
at something in the room

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.240 align:middle line:84%
from an impossible angle
or that they couldn't

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
see the geometrical
markers in the room,

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:90%
like the walls and such.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:10%
The most phenomenal and to me
threatening part of the shared

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:10%
death experience-- and this
is definitely not something I

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.470 align:middle line:10%
want--

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:10%
is that I've heard
from a lot of people

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.860 align:middle line:10%
that as the person in the bed
dies that the bystander himself

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:10%
or herself empathically
participated in the dying life

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.890 align:middle line:10%
review of the person
who passed away.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, to me, this is a
very uncomfortable thought

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not
even looking forward

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:84%
to my own life review,
much less the idea

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that there could be a spectator
there or somebody might

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
want to pass the popcorn
or something, right?

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:90%
So this is really horrible.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:10%
And yet, for a long
time, I thought

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:10%
this has to be all
confined to people

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:10%
who had some
personal relationship

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:10%
with the individual.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:10%
But then a few years ago,
I got a communication

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:10%
from a doctor who told me
that he was called to the ER

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:10%
to resuscitate a patient
he had never laid eyes on.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.460 align:middle line:10%
And as he was
resuscitating the guy,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:10%
he said these images obviously
relating to this man's life

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:10%
just was springing
up all around him.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And another neat thing about
it is that apparently it's

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.240 align:middle line:90%
not embarrassing.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And this woman I
interviewed in about 1989

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
or '90 in Carrollton, Georgia,
is a very, very touching memory

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.880 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:84%
She must have been
in her 70s, I guess.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the red hair and
the little mole on the cheek.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just a very,
very remarkable story

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:90%
she told me about.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Her relationship
with her husband

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:84%
was one that doesn't exist
much in this world anymore.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was what the
Greeks call "sturgay."

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.975 align:middle line:84%
The way you spell
this is S-T-U-R-G-A-Y.

00:04:20.975 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's the form of love that
develops between two people--

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:84%
for example, a boy and a girl
who are raised on adjacent

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:90%
farms way out in the country.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And they spend
their lives as they

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:90%
grow up together as playmates.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they just
sort of naturally

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:90%
evolve into a marriage.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
kind of marriage

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
that this woman and
her husband had.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And they married right
out of high school.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And they lived a couple
of doors from each other.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And he developed a particularly
rampant form of lung cancer

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:90%
and died very quickly.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But she was there with
him in the hospital room.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And she said as he was dying,
this panorama of everything

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:90%
he had ever done sprang up.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said of course
she recognized a lot of it

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:90%
because she had lived it, too.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But there were other things
that she didn't know.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
interesting things--

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
she said there were certain
parts of her husband's life

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
that were blocked off by these
little translucent or panels

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
or something she
couldn't see through.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:90%
And she was upset about this.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.440 align:middle line:84%
But she said this review
was conducted in company

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.930 align:middle line:84%
with this being of
complete compassion

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:84%
that she and her husband
identified as Christ.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And she said when she was
uncomfortable about this

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:84%
that it was explained to
her that this being said,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:90%
oh, that's not anything bad.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just that that's not the
time for you yet to know this.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:84%
She said that
during this review,

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.380 align:middle line:84%
she was audibly talking
with her husband

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:90%
back and forth about it.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And so what is going on here?

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
These are things that are
very difficult to put together

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:84%
on this old model of the oxygen
deprivation to the brain,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I had been studying near-death
experiences for 10 years

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84%
by the time I started
medical school.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
people I grew up with

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.340 align:middle line:84%
were ahead of me
in medical school.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So by the time I entered medical
school in September of '72,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:90%
the faculty knew.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And I will say within
the first two weeks,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
eight medical
professors reached out

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and said, Dr. Moody, thank
you for investigating this.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
About half of them
were people who had

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:90%
had the experience themselves.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:84%
About the other half had heard
this from their own patients.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:90%
So fast forward.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:03.170 align:middle line:84%
It's about late December,
early January of my first year.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I was in the bookstore
at the medical school.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And this very nice woman
came and introduced herself

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:90%
as Dr. So-and-so.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately
recognized the name

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
because she was a distinguished
professor of medicine.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And the faculty had
known about my work.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So she said, Dr. Moody, I've
been wanting to talk to you.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is so funny
to me even to this day.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:84%
She said, about some
mentation I had when

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I was resuscitating my mother.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:84%
That word "mentation"
I thought was so neat.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So she guided me across
the campus to her office.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And she told me that sometime
before, she was unsuccessfully

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.530 align:middle line:84%
trying to resuscitate her
mother from a cardiac arrest.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And she said that as
her mother was dying,

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
she said she felt
her mother dying.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Then she felt herself lift up.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And she could see her body
standing and her mother's

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:90%
deceased body down below.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I was
trying to get my bearings.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And she realized
that her mother--

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:84%
began to use her words--
now in spirit form

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:90%
was there beside her.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said she saw her
mother recede into this light.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And she said she saw emerging
from that light people, some

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:84%
of whom she recognized as
people that her mother had

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.650 align:middle line:90%
known who had died.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.270 align:middle line:90%
But others she didn't recognize.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And she said she assumed
those were people

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.330 align:middle line:84%
that her mother had known
before she herself was born.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.570 align:middle line:84%
But she said then as her
mother receded into this light,

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
she said it closed off
like the lens of a camera,

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:90%
like that spiral motion.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And then she was standing there
beside her mother's dead body

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:90%
and back in her own body.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first one I heard.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.750 align:middle line:84%
That was in December of
'72 or January of '73.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.710 align:middle line:90%
And they're just very common.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the most interesting
cases of a shared death

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
experience came to me from
an old family practitioner

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:84%
in Maine who I met
years ago who told me

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:84%
that he had this elderly
woman patient who had

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:90%
what we call a "cor bovinum."

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is from long,
sustained hypertension

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
will cause the heart
to be sort of globular,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:90%
like the heart of a cow.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And these hearts
are very irritable.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So this woman was
in the hospital.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:90%
She kept having cardiac arrests.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.450 align:middle line:90%
And they would resuscitate her.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And so after a while, she
said to the doctors, look.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.230 align:middle line:90%
I've lived a full life.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to go.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
hard thing sometimes

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:90%
for physicians to deal with.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.710 align:middle line:90%
So a discussion occurred.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And this woman's companion,
who had known all her life--

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
this other woman who
was staying there

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:84%
with her in the hospital--
said, well, just back off.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'll do this.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:90%
And so everybody did.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.600 align:middle line:84%
The doctors and nurses
just backed off,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
leaving the woman
and her companion.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And the woman said after a
while that her friend did

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:90%
have another cardiac arrest.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:14.470 align:middle line:84%
However, when that happened, the
woman was embracing her friend.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And when the heart
stopped, she felt it.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.090 align:middle line:90%
And unconsciously, she jerked.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that would
cause the heart to stop again.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:90%
So embarrassed-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle line:90%
I won't do it again.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.600 align:middle line:90%
So again, same scenario.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:84%
The next time, the woman
had the cardiac arrest.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And her companion
just let her go.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the companion told the
doctor that as her friend died,

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
that she herself
lifted out of her body.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And they were both going upward
on an incline in this light.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And she saw at the top all
of the friends and relatives

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:84%
of the woman who were there
to meet her and to greet her.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the woman
who was the companion

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:90%
came back and joined her body.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:04.680 align:middle line:84%
This woman was obviously just
overjoyed and astonished.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And as I gather from
talking with the physician,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:84%
just as with any other person
with a near-death experience,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:84%
it may sound
extraordinary to us.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But to the person
to whom it happens,

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:84%
it's a very personal
and inspiring event.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think this woman
was inspired but also--

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:90%
maybe even more so--

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
the doctor who heard this
experience because he

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.210 align:middle line:84%
told me that it really
dramatically changed

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle line:84%
his way of dealing
with people as well.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:84%
I just know from experience that
doctors who encounter something

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
like this-- it
really does change

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.540 align:middle line:90%
the way you treat patients.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I think after you hear
a few near-death experiences,

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:84%
then you get a whole different
take on your patients.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.490 align:middle line:84%
You just realize that you're
not dealing with somebody

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.840 align:middle line:90%
in a time-limited framework.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.200 align:middle line:84%
In a case of resuscitation,
you are dealing apparently,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I gather, with intersecting
spheres of existence.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And that brings a sort
of responsibility.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
doctors who finally

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:84%
learn about these near-death
experiences-- it really

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
does change their way
of doing medicine.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Shared death
experiences immediately

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.060 align:middle line:84%
made me realize there's
something wrong with the oxygen

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:84%
deprivation to the
brain scenario.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Because if the bystanders
are having the same thing,

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:84%
then it's not the oxygen
deprivation to the brain.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:45.370 align:middle line:10%
So that was what woke me
up to the significance

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:10%
of the experience within
the medical framework,

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:10%
or how to talk about
it with doctors.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of how to
talk about the afterlife,

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.980 align:middle line:84%
well, what I would say
is that human beings,

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
to my utter astonishment,
are apparently

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:90%
transdimensional beings.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.870 align:middle line:84%
That is that we pretend not
just to this physical realm

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle line:84%
of existence, but to some
other state of existence

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:84%
which from this framework
we can hardly even imagine.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And so since we do, I
think it's very important

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.900 align:middle line:84%
to get busy on trying
to put into some sort

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:35.140 align:middle line:84%
of understandable words
what that experience is

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.760 align:middle line:84%
of transition to another
state of existence.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:84%
The logic that we all
learned from childhood

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.120 align:middle line:90%
was invented by Aristotle.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And he predicated it
on literal meaning

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:90%
and the true-false distinction.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's a wonderful
thing because

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.940 align:middle line:90%
of what has come out of logic.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
However, there is a
whole domain of language

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:84%
that is not meaningful but which
is nonetheless very important.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:10%
Because Dr. Seuss
and Lewis Carroll

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:10%
can create language that is
very evocative and moves us

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:10%
and takes us some way
to different places

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.616 align:middle line:10%
but that doesn't
make a bit of sense.

00:14:22.616 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is very hard
to put into simple words

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's something
I've been working

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:90%
on I guess since I was a kid.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
But what I have done
is that I have worked

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:90%
out the logic of nonsense.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds
self-contradictory, I know.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And we don't like
that word "nonsense,"

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:90%
except we love nonsense.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:90%
People love nonsense.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.980 align:middle line:84%
But they hate the
word "nonsense."

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Doo-wop music-- sha na na na
na na, sha na na na na na,

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:90%
get a job.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Playground rhymes-- one bright
day in the middle of the night,

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.570 align:middle line:90%
two dead boys got up to fight.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Back to back they faced each
other, drew their swords

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and shot each other.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:84%
A deaf policeman heard the
noise and came and killed

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:90%
those two dead boys.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So many people have
very fond memories

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.170 align:middle line:90%
of that from childhood.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:84%
When I would be
talking with a patient,

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:84%
very often in various
kinds of illnesses,

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:90%
patients talk nonsense.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
they are intoxicated

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:84%
with mercury or ethylene
gas or nitrous oxide,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:90%
they'll talk nonsensically.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Or if they are delirious,
they talk on and on.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's nonsense.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Or people with
schizophrenia will make up

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
these meaningless
words and so on.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:10%
And so what I realized was
that the nonsense that I heard

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:10%
from my patients
were identically

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:10%
the same types of nonsense
that Dr. Seuss and Lewis

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.670 align:middle line:10%
Carroll write about, which
means that nonsense is nonsense

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:10%
whether it is deliberate
or involuntary.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, nonsense
has its own structure.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's built into the mind.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:90%
But we have blocked it out.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But because of a
specific historical event

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:84%
that took place in the life of
Aristotle, in the West in 2018,

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.430 align:middle line:84%
we can't think logically
about nonsense.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And that creates a situation
where we cannot think logically

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.940 align:middle line:84%
about sentences like,
there is life after death,

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:90%
which is a self-contradiction.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, to begin at the
beginning, nonsense

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:84%
is not something like
we have in our mind

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:84%
as something kind of unformed
and undifferentiated.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I have identified over 70
different types of nonsense.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure there's others.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Listen to this.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
'Twas brillig, and the slithy
toves did gyre and gimble

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.330 align:middle line:90%
in the wabe.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, obviously that's nonsense.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:90%
But now listen to this.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Holiness pursues the vestigial
lipstick of spontaneity.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.420 align:middle line:90%
That's nonsense, too.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:90%
But it's a different type.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Or listen to this.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.839 align:middle line:84%
That cannibal you
man just ate was

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:90%
the last one in this county.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.839 align:middle line:84%
That's nonsense, too, but of
a different type, so much so

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.839 align:middle line:84%
that now that you see this,
I could give you an unknown.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:84%
And you could fit it
into the category.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
If I said, for example,
I'm not an actor,

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:84%
but I played one on
television, which

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.840 align:middle line:90%
pattern does that exemplify?

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:90%
It's the third pattern, right?

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So we can think logically about
things that don't make sense.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:84%
It just takes a while
of learning new rules

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about this.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And then when we come
back after that process

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.050 align:middle line:84%
to the near-death
experience, then we

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.700 align:middle line:84%
can think about it
in a whole new way

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
such that if before you happen
to have a near-death experience

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
you know how to think logically
about nonsensical things,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
then when you come back from
that near-death experience,

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:84%
you're able to put it into
a whole different framework.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And that, for the
first time, enables us

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:90%
to give a class of comparison.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:84%
We already have lots and lots
of near-death experiences

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:84%
that are formulated
through the lens

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle line:84%
of Aristotelian logic, which
makes it a travel narrative.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I think in the not
too distant future,

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.590 align:middle line:84%
we'll have other accounts
of near-death experiences

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
that are propounded
in some other way.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And that gives us a
way of comparison.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.890 align:middle line:90%
We can compare the two cases.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's where my
research is now.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's already
had one success.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.945 align:middle line:84%
A very wonderful
scientist, an artist--

00:18:39.945 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:90%
a sculptor, as matter of fact--

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
who took one of my
seminars years before

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:84%
then developed H1N1 flu and was
in the hospital for 60 days,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.430 align:middle line:84%
lost his leg from gangrene, had
three near-death experiences

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:90%
during the time.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And as he was
describing this to me,

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:84%
he said-- and his voice
became very energetic.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Raymond,
while I was over there,

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:09.030 align:middle line:84%
he said, my mind went back
to the course on nonsense.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I realized that
what you were saying is true--

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:84%
that you can't comprehend
how that world is

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:84%
connected to this world unless--
and this is his exact words.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:90%
It's just funny.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:84%
He said, unless you take
the unintelligible axis

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:84%
into account, which is his
way of putting it, I guess,

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:90%
as a physicist would.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.700 align:middle line:84%
We have to change
our logic in our mind

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:38.220 align:middle line:84%
to really grapple with this
question of life after death.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Things that don't
make sense in one era

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.020 align:middle line:90%
may make sense in a later era.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, go back
in your mind now

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:84%
into the mind of a highly
educated person of the year

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
1915 and listen
to this sentence.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
All four of Asdel's
grandparents perished

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and were lost in a shipwreck
long before her mother

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.430 align:middle line:90%
and father were born.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:84%
In 1915, it's just
unintelligible.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Add the knowledge of DNA,
cloning, of gene editing,

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and now that
same sentence makes sense.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going through
an identical situation

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:90%
with the near-death experience.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make sense by
the standard logic we have.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:84%
But we now have
new, exciting ways

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about
things that will

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:84%
make the near-death experience
and the shared death experience

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:84%
part of our common
human vocabulary.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:10%
Read various documents
from other cultures,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:10%
like the "Tibetan
Book of the Dead"

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:10%
and on, that seem to
indicate that there

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:10%
is some definite term or
time that the person hovers

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.860 align:middle line:10%
around the body.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:84%
But this is not what
I've heard from patients

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:90%
with near-death experiences.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, probably
the most common thing

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:84%
that I hear from
people is that as soon

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:84%
as they are out of
their body, they kind of

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.510 align:middle line:90%
lose interest in it.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And they may not
even recognize it.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I've heard people say that
when they looked at the body

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:84%
on the table, they had
no idea that was them

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:90%
until they figured it out.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I think what this is all
about is consciousness

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and these different
kind of scenarios

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.990 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to play out
and how long the spirit

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.160 align:middle line:90%
hangs around the body.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:10%
I don't know that these
really have answers

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.710 align:middle line:10%
because what I hear from
people is that when you go over

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:10%
to this other dimension,
you're totally out of the time

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:10%
framework anyway.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And I just can't
imagine being connected

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.190 align:middle line:90%
with this body for eternity.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, please spare me that.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that shared death
experiences are very

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.770 align:middle line:90%
important for several reasons.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the
theory of it, they

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:04.040 align:middle line:84%
show that the explanation of
near-death experiences in terms

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.470 align:middle line:84%
of the oxygen cutoff to
the brain is invalid.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:13.090 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the people left
behind, my general sense of it

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.790 align:middle line:84%
is that the people who go
through this with their dying

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:90%
loved ones--

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:84%
it's just a very
meaningful thing to people

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.200 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
empathically participate

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.950 align:middle line:84%
in that exiting of
their loved ones.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:middle line:90%
That's what I hear from people.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.300 align:middle line:10%
And these situations
that still occur

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:10%
in hospitals from
time to time, sadly,

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:38.020 align:middle line:10%
where when the patient is
dying that the family is

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:10%
ushered out of the room--

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.970 align:middle line:10%
that's a very sad thing
to me because it's

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:10%
very inspiring to be there
at the death of a loved one.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I had a shared death
experience with my family

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:84%
at the death of
my mother in 1994.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:10%
And it was very interesting
because that weekend,

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.820 align:middle line:10%
I was at a seminar
where we were planning

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:10%
to create a systematic
study of shared death

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.040 align:middle line:10%
experiences along with a lot of
psychologists and scientists.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.380 align:middle line:90%
And it was Mother's Day of 1994.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And I called my mom
from the shopping mall

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.157 align:middle line:84%
to wish her a
Happy Mother's Day.

00:23:19.157 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:90%
I said, how are you doing?

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
cheerfulness of her.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm doing great--

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.820 align:middle line:90%
very cheerful.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
and then yesterday,

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:84%
which was a Saturday, she
said, I developed this rash.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And my brothers and
sisters had taken her

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.940 align:middle line:84%
to the doctor, who said
that, well, I don't think

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.410 align:middle line:90%
this is anything significant.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But he gave her an appointment
to see another doctor

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:84%
on the Monday, which was the
day after I talked with her.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So on Sunday,
everything was fine.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.420 align:middle line:84%
On Monday, my mom
went to the doctor.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you have
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And you have two days
to two weeks to live.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, two weeks later
to the day, my mother did die.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, my wife and
my sister and my brother-in-law

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:84%
all experienced
something like that.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:90%
I just have no words for it.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
The best I can say
is that the room

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.140 align:middle line:84%
changed into this double
funnel kind of thing.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:90%
The light was different.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was this energy
that was swirling around,

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:84%
although there was no
sensation of vertigo.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It was like a energy that was
sweeping around and around.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.340 align:middle line:90%
And I heard my mother not--

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:44.710 align:middle line:84%
but in here very clearly
say, I love you, twice.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:84%
She had been in a coma
two days at that point.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And so oddly, the experience
that I had geared up

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:84%
to study, just within a
couple of weeks after we

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:84%
made that, there I
experienced it myself.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And that actually made me
drop the project because what

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:90%
motivates me is curiosity.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that I
had experienced it

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.855 align:middle line:90%
myself at Canada--

00:25:10.855 --> 00:25:13.120 align:middle line:84%
I lost interest in
that for a few years.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Then I came back later
and did some more of it.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.510 align:middle line:90%
But it's really startling.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I am a lover of the knowledge
process and reason and logic

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:25.345 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:25:25.345 --> 00:25:28.150 align:middle line:90%


00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:31.630 align:middle line:10%
And the fact is
that people commonly

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:36.460 align:middle line:10%
have experiences that just
don't fit into that framework

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:10%
that I am so fond of.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.560 align:middle line:10%
And to me, that is not
an occasion of despair,

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:10%
but rather an occasion
to expand the framework.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to expand our logical
modes of thinking so that we

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:56.330 align:middle line:84%
can incorporate these amazing
things that happen to people

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:90%
in the dying experience.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So I think that these new logics
really will help us understand

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
shared death experiences
and near-death experiences

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and to even more deeply mine
the richness that's in 'em I

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.200 align:middle line:90%
think--

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.780 align:middle line:84%
that's what will
naturally happen.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:90%
