00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:21.720 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I am Raymond Moody,
and these are my thoughts

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.280 align:middle line:90%
on reincarnation.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.940 align:middle line:10%
Where I've come
to in my life is I

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:10%
expect that something like
reincarnation is true.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I came
to it is very unusual,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.430 align:middle line:10%
and it has nothing to do with
parapsychology and so on,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:10%
because my ideas about
it come from two sources.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Number one, ancient
Greek philosophy,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
because in the United
States, there's

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:84%
this myth that ideas
about reincarnation

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
first came into the West through
India back in the 19th century.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
But that's just
simply not correct,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.140 align:middle line:84%
because reincarnation
was present as an idea

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
at the very beginning
of Western civilization.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.170 align:middle line:10%
And Pythagoras, for example,
who was the person who

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.760 align:middle line:10%
coined the term "philosophy,"
was a reincarnationist,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:10%
and he claimed to remember
eight of his past lives

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:10%
and had some
technique that he was

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:10%
able to get his students to
have that experience as well.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And as part of their
Pythagorean training,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.150 align:middle line:84%
when they woke up
in the morning,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:84%
before they got out
of bed, they would

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:84%
have to retrace their
steps of the day before--

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
go through the entire
day, step by step,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:90%
before they got out of bed.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And then if they
had mastered that,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
then they would have to go back
one day further than that--

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:90%
the day before.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
this training was

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:84%
they felt that if they
could so exquisitely train

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
their memories,
then when they got

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:84%
into the situation of
choosing their next life,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
they would remember what they
had picked up in this life

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:90%
to be able to augment.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So, you see, reincarnation
was there at the beginning.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Plato was a reincarnationist
and had some very brilliant

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
perceptions, I think, about
the reincarnation process,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
one of them being that he
made an articulate statement

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
about why we don't
remember our past lives.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was
he formulated it

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:84%
in terms of an experience
that every one of us has had,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.065 align:middle line:84%
and it's called, in
psychology, an event boundary.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:10%
What an event boundary
is an event boundary

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:10%
has to do with the fact
that the mind puts things

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:10%
into little packets
for processing.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:10%
And when you get
out of that packet,

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:10%
you may not have access
to that information.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And the most common example is
that you're in the living room

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and you think of something you
want to get in the kitchen.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So what happens as soon as
you go through the doorway

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:90%
into the kitchen?

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
You forget what you
came in there for.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's an event
boundary, and Plato

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
articulated how that is
involved in the reincarnation

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.320 align:middle line:90%
So that was one input to me.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And the other has to do with
my wonderful adopted children.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And I should explain
that my wife and I don't

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:90%
attend religious ceremonies.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
We don't take the kids
to any religious things.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And also, we don't talk
about life after death.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
What we talk about
is what's for dinner,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:90%
what's the kid's homework?

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So these kids have really been
raised in isolation from this.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And the way they
found out, eventually,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that I had anything to
do with life after death

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
was looking me up
on the internet.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.960 align:middle line:90%
So that's the background.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, when Carter
was five years old,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.930 align:middle line:84%
he and I were lying on
the bed watching TV,

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and I was flipping
through the channels

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.355 align:middle line:84%
whereas Carter
became very animated.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:90%
He said, dad, dad!

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.200 align:middle line:90%
That's my village.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:90%
So I turned it back.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:84%
It was a documentary about
village life in China.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So Carter said to me,
yeah, that's my village!

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And he could tell
that I was confused.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, you know,
before I came to you and mom,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I was in China with my other
mom and dad and my brothers

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:90%
and sisters.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And then he could tell
I was still confused.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:90%
So then he said, yeah.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And he said, dad, I was up
in the trees, looking at you

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.320 align:middle line:90%
and mom down lying in the grass.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And I knew exactly what
he was talking about,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:84%
because five years
before he came along,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:84%
my wife and I were
on a tour of Greece,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and we went to this
archaeological site.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And the attendant could
tell we were just exhausted

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
from our trip, so he said, lie
down in the grass over there

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:90%
and take a nap.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were
trees all around us.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And so what we were talking
about was adopting a baby.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, my wife and I just
didn't follow it up.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you had gone
on and asked questions,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and you had a danger
of shaping the story,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:84%
but we just don't
talk about this.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.510 align:middle line:84%
But what this means is
that Carter sometimes

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:90%
brings it up even now.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Just a couple of years
ago, I was walking

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:90%
into the foyer of our house.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:90%
He purposely took me aside.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me and said, dad,
you know I came here for you,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah, yeah.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, my daughter, Carol
Anne, is Blackfeet--

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Native American.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Again, we adopted her at birth.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:90%
No religious background.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.210 align:middle line:84%
We don't talk to the kids
about stuff like this.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So she took these
long walks to me.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And about, I guess,
eight or nine years ago,

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.620 align:middle line:84%
walking along our
route, and there

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:90%
was this old, wooden bridge.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:84%
She just loves to
sit there and talk.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So this one day,
out of nowhere, she

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:90%
said, I don't like this place.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:10%
And it was obvious that
what she was talking about

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:10%
was the world.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:90%
So I was shocked.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And she said, when you
die, you just go up,

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and you be with God,
and he keeps you there

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:84%
till all the people you know
while you're alive have died,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and then he sends you
back as another person.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So I say, well, what
makes you think that?

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I just
know in my mind.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
and I was with God,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:90%
and God pointed you out to me.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you got to go
down to be his daughter.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how
did you feel about that?

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, I
didn't want to do it.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to stay
with my "God-dy."

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But, she said-- but he pushed
me down to be your daughter.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, well, are
you glad you came anyway?

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah, sure.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, we don't
follow these things up.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But what that means
is, eventually, they--

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:84%
when I took my daughter
to Japan about a year ago,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and I heard her at another
table holding forth about this,

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and she told this to
the people on the table.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:10%
So I think that
there's reincarnation,

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.750 align:middle line:10%
because that what my
kids have told me,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.840 align:middle line:10%
and I really believe
them, because believe me,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.190 align:middle line:10%
when you have kids when you're
in your 50s, you observe.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:90%
You really do.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
define the essence of what

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:09.090 align:middle line:84%
we are-- that inner thing
that we identify as ourselves,

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and maybe because
it's so basic to us

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:84%
that there's not
many words for it.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just
at the rock bottom.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:84%
You can't get much further
down in your analysis

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
than that basic, rock bottom
sense of self-identity

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.600 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And there aren't any
good words for it.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:10%
I think of it as
what I consist of

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:38.880 align:middle line:10%
is a conscious locus,
as it is-- a locus

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:10%
of intense personal identity
that I regard as myself.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And that it is
the subject that I

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.050 align:middle line:84%
am talking about when I say
the word "I," for example,

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and that it is the entity that
is persistent through this life

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:90%
story that I've lived.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:84%
However, to get it beyond
that becomes more confusing,

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:84%
because granted, let's say
that I've been reincarnated.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Then what is the relationship
between that conscious self

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
that I am now and the
conscious self that

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:19.030 align:middle line:84%
inhabited some other life
in some previous century?

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I just don't know
the answer to that, but I mean,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly grappling with
it and trying to figure it out.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But some of the
greatest philosophers

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.520 align:middle line:84%
have said that it's
entirely an illusion.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what they think in
Hinduism, too, isn't it?

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:10%
That our sense of self
is just really illusory.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
If it is an illusion, it's
the most persistent illusion,

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:84%
because even when
everything else turns out

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:84%
to be a dream or
illusion, at least

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.630 align:middle line:90%
you feel like you are you.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
That was the whole
point of Descartes.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to find a
premise that nobody could deny.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:90%
So what he found--

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
as long as I am
thinking, I think, I am.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.730 align:middle line:90%
So if I'm thinking, I am.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:84%
But then to try to
define, in simple terms,

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:84%
what that thinking is, or
that conscious process is

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:90%
is very difficult.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.690 align:middle line:84%
What Plato says
is that after you

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.760 align:middle line:84%
leave your body
on this existence,

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
then you go into
some other realm.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And after some
length of time has

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:84%
elapsed on this Earth
plane, for some reason

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.550 align:middle line:90%
you choose to go back.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And according to Plato, anyway,
there is a conscious process

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:84%
in selecting the life
that you're going to lead,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and that you consider
different alternatives

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and then you choose
someone that I

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
gather that you would feel that
you would learn something from.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
On rare occasions, people who
have near-death experience

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.600 align:middle line:84%
will see something that
relates to a previous life.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally, the
first thing I want to say

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
is that it doesn't have
anything to do with the people's

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:84%
religious training,
because it happened

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that the first two
of these I heard

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:84%
were from people from Georgia
who were Southern Baptists,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
so this was not
in their training.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But this wonderful woman I
got to know very well who had

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:84%
a very profound
near-death experience--

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
this woman had lived in the
same house all her life.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And I knew her father and
her two older sisters,

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of her
relatives and friends.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.310 align:middle line:10%
When this woman was
three years old,

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:10%
she ran out in
front of her house--

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.180 align:middle line:10%
this would have
been in the 1930s.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:10%
She ran out in
front of the house,

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:10%
and this was the era
before seat belts.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
car coming along,

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and when this woman ran
out into the street,

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:90%
the car slammed on brakes.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And in that event, a
three-year-old child

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:84%
who was standing
in the front seat

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:90%
was dashed down and killed.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And this was the event
that took place in her life

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
that I talked about with
her father and her sisters,

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:90%
because this could be--

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.680 align:middle line:90%
what a horror.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:84%
She said in her life
review, that appeared,

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:84%
but there was this filament
that attached it to an event

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:90%
in some other place.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:84%
She said she doesn't
know where this was.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:84%
But that in this
version of it, she

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle line:84%
was a child sitting
on the buckboard--

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I guess they called
it-- of a carriage going

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:90%
along the street.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And a child who she
recognized as the child who

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:56.450 align:middle line:84%
had been killed in the car
ran in front of the horses,

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and the driver pulled back on
the reins, and she was killed.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's extraordinary,
that it should

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:90%
be so literal a recounting.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Until you get to
thinking, well, of course.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can really
ever understand yourself

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.390 align:middle line:84%
is to see the effects that
your actions and thoughts have

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:90%
had on other people.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:84%
So in the broader
scheme of things,

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:84%
it would make
perfect sense to me

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that we review every
event in our lives

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:84%
from the point of
view of other people

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:84%
too, because only by that
process can we understand it.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Once in a while, somebody
tells me of a flash forward.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
They say that as part of
their near-death experience--

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and maybe in connection
with their life review--

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:84%
they get a run-through of
what the rest of their life

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.400 align:middle line:90%
is going to be like.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these come through
in a very, very revealing way.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:84%
If I am allowed a license, here,
to change details a little bit

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:07.400 align:middle line:84%
to not embarrass
a living person,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:90%
I will describe a woman--

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:84%
an executive in a very
big organization--

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:84%
who, let's say, at
the age of 22 was

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:27.950 align:middle line:84%
involved in a car
wreck, during which she

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:84%
went through and met
somebody and got married

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:90%
and had five kids.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.420 align:middle line:84%
So then she's drawn
back to the hospital

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and trying to tell the
doctors, I can't be here.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I've got a husband
and five kids.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:10%
So she withheld
this for a long time

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:10%
until she met somebody who was a
philosophy professor that she--

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.260 align:middle line:10%
so she told this
story, and then he

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:10%
said, well, you should read
Raymond Moody's, and that

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.730 align:middle line:10%
was the connection.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:84%
But in the real event,
all those things happened,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and she married the guy,
and then she had children.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
other complications, too,

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:84%
which had been
foretold in this event.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the
only one I've heard of.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's just
one that comes to mind.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I
occasionally hear people

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
say that they get a flash
forward of their life.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And Plato had an
opinion about it.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:84%
He said that you go around
these cycles of life,

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
but then you eventually
get to this point

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
where you can step
off that wheel

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.910 align:middle line:90%
and go up to another level.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:90%
I ask people all the time--

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I say, let's say that
you were diagnosed

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:84%
with a horrible
infection that required

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:51.070 align:middle line:84%
that you be isolated all
by yourself on a desert

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:90%
island for 10 years.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And let's say that they took
you out there in a cargo plane,

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and there was plenty of room
in the hold for all the food

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:84%
and water and medicine you were
going to need for 10 years,

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
but there was some
extra room where

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:84%
they could have, say, a
DVD player and, let's say,

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.570 align:middle line:90%
3,000 DVDs.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So what I ask people is,
would you choose all comedies?

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, of the years I've
been asking this question,

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.790 align:middle line:84%
I have only heard
three people say yeah.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Most people say no, of course
I wouldn't choose all comedies.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, well, would
you choose some tragedies, too?

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.462 align:middle line:90%
And they say, well, sure.

00:16:37.462 --> 00:16:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I say,
well, when you were

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:84%
on that desert island
watching those tragedies,

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.270 align:middle line:90%
would you be crying?

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And they say, of course,
because that's the experience

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:90%
of watching a tragedy.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm
getting at is that,

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.500 align:middle line:84%
analogously, let's say there's
some state of existence outside

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
of this one where I choose
to come from that one

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:90%
into this one for some purpose.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle line:84%
It would make
perfect sense to me

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.099 align:middle line:84%
that I would choose
all kinds of suffering.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just because you would
want to know it from within.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:84%
You would want to
know how that feels.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:10%
And so it's perfectly
plausible to me

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:18.099 align:middle line:10%
that, from the framework
outside of this one,

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:10%
we would choose to come into
it knowing that we were going

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:10%
to be having a certain kind
of suffering, because we know

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:10%
from that framework
that it's time-limited,

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.750 align:middle line:10%
that you'll be out of it.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But then once you get
into this framework,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:90%
that knowledge is blocked.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So that you're faced, there,
with the raw suffering,

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:84%
without the insight,
maybe-- the event

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:84%
that you chose in
the first place--

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.240 align:middle line:90%
but also that it will be over.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of those
past life regressions

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:90%
with my students.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Not because of my own
interest actually,

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:84%
but in 1985, when I was
teaching in this university,

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:84%
there was a fad about
that, and my students

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:90%
wanted to know how to do it.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So over a period of
years, I gathered--

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how-- a
couple of hundred people

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I guided through these
past life regressions.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And I will say, number one,
that it really set me back

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.110 align:middle line:84%
on what I had thought, because
what people say is that number

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:84%
one, these are all
very hysterical

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:90%
and suggestible people.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And number two,
everybody is always

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:90%
either Napoleon or Cleopatra.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things that
I thought about this.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:84%
But then when I
started doing it,

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.250 align:middle line:84%
it's really
interesting, because all

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:84%
of the people I
guided through it--

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
nobody was ever
anybody exceptional.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.880 align:middle line:84%
These were just
very workaday, plain

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:84%
lives in different
cultures and so on.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And my friend, who does
this, guided me through it.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was completely
startled by it,

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:84%
because it was totally different
from what I had imagined.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.200 align:middle line:90%
This was hyper-photograph.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:84%
This was more clear
than a photograph.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:10.560 align:middle line:84%
But also, I had this really
interesting double perspective.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I could look at these images,
and I could say, well,

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:84%
now I'm going to go
into that and see

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.970 align:middle line:84%
how it was like from the
character's point of view.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But then I could
switch out and I

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.440 align:middle line:84%
could watch that character,
who identified as me, doing it.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So it was like you
could come in and out.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I gather that there
must be ways that you

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:84%
can tap into these
memories of past lives.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.500 align:middle line:84%
However, I do respect
the Tibetan tradition

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.470 align:middle line:84%
that says you'd probably
better leave it alone.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle line:90%
And the reason is--

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Plato said a similar thing.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.440 align:middle line:84%
If, at every moment
in our waking life,

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:84%
we were flooded with all this
information from past lives,

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.830 align:middle line:84%
it would make it more
difficult to concentrate

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:90%
on this task at hand.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Also, it's very interesting that
a number of great historians

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:90%
have been inspired--

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and their study of
history-- by apparently

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:90%
spontaneous past life memories.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:10%
And the one I encountered when
I was an undergraduate was I

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:10%
took a fancy to "A Study of
History" by Arnold Toynbee,

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:10%
which, as I remember, it's
about 11 volumes long.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you plow through
it, toward the end,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:84%
he tells this really
fascinating story

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:84%
about what had woke
him up to history,

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and that was that when
he was a young man--

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it was about 1919 or
somewhere in that period--

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.770 align:middle line:84%
he went, as a student,
for a summer to Greece.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said several times
it happened to him--

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:90%
not from any plain reason--

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.920 align:middle line:84%
and to use his exact
words, he said,

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
"I dropped through
a pocket in time."

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And you could tell he
thought-- he was serious

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:90%
about it, that it was real.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said the ancient
world would just

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:90%
be resurrected around him.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And on one of
these occasions, he

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:84%
saw a horrific battle
going on, and he

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
said at that very
moment, he decided

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.880 align:middle line:84%
that he was going
to study history

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.490 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand the role
of sin in the affairs of men.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And over the years,
I've encountered

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.790 align:middle line:84%
a number of history
professors or historians

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:84%
who tell me that same
story-- that they

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:84%
got interested in history
by some spontaneous event

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
in which they seemed to be
propelled back to a past life.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:84%
In 1990 or '91, in
the Canary Islands,

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.260 align:middle line:84%
after my lecture on
some other topic--

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
near-death experiences--

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:84%
this Spanish history professor
came up with this wife.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me, he said, I
never had a bit of interest

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.300 align:middle line:84%
But he said some years
before, he and his wife

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.340 align:middle line:84%
had been taking
a tour of Europe,

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and they ended up
in this cathedral,

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and he said on the wall of
the cathedral was a mural,

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and in the mural was a
picture of a certain man--

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:90%
a monk or something.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said as he
looked at that picture,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:84%
he said concentric circles
and a kind of tunnel

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
opened up between
him and that man,

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and he had a conversation
with that man.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered, at
that time, did that

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:84%
mean that he had some
past life connection,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.490 align:middle line:84%
or was that just
some anomaly which

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:84%
opened up some kind of
disturbance in time?

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And how would you tell
the difference, really?

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I think my major breakthrough
in being an investigator of life

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:90%
after death came--

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
my best guess is in
February of 1965.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was an honors
student in philosophy

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.840 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Virginia.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And I say that not to
pat myself on the back,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.440 align:middle line:84%
but to explain that for my
last two years of college, all

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I had to do was to go see
my tutor one day a week

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:90%
and read a paper to him.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And I could take
any classes, and I

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
could sit in on the
philosophy graduate seminar.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And the philosophical
topics of 1965,

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.150 align:middle line:84%
taught by John Marshall
and Peter Heath--

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and I was an
undergraduate student,

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and the topic was
life after death.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And the question
for the evening was

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:55.340 align:middle line:84%
is the notion of the personal
survival of bodily death

00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:84%
number one, intelligible,
or number two, credible?

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And my answer was that
it was unintelligible,

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
make any sense

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:84%
to say there is life after
death, because what that means,

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.420 align:middle line:84%
when you unpack it,
is there is life

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:84%
after the final,
irreversible, cessation

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.830 align:middle line:84%
of life, which is a
self-contradiction.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:10%
And in that seminar, one
of the things we read

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.220 align:middle line:10%
was David Hume's great
essay about immortality

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:10%
in which he said, "By
the mere light of reason,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.730 align:middle line:10%
it seems difficult to prove
the immortality of the soul.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.730 align:middle line:10%
Some new species of
logic is required

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:10%
for that purpose, and some
new faculties of the mind

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:10%
that they may enable us
to comprehend that logic."

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was working
on that already.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:84%
See, my interest in philosophy
was unintelligibility.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.430 align:middle line:84%
It's things that
don't make sense.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So that very night
was what I had,

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and actually, it was my
doctoral dissertation

00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:59.770 align:middle line:90%
about four years later--

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:90%
was part of that.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And not on the afterlife,
but on unintelligibility.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And I've continued to do it to
where I say that, in 2018, I

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:16.750 align:middle line:84%
claim that there is absolutely a
logically coherent way to think

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.640 align:middle line:90%
about life after death.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But that to do that, you've
got to change your own mind.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:84%
You've got to work on
your own mind first,

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.840 align:middle line:84%
because the logic we have
in the mind won't work.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But you can fix your mind
and the logic in such a way

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.400 align:middle line:84%
that you really can comprehend
these big questions about life

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.330 align:middle line:90%
after death.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:84%
What brought me around to
the inner necessity of saying

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
afterlife was not

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.930 align:middle line:84%
the logical process of
drawing a conclusion,

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:84%
but rather, it was being
forced into a situation where

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what else to say.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is that I have many
wonderful physicians who

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:84%
I would absolutely trust
as medical doctors,

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.110 align:middle line:84%
even in an extreme situation,
to turn myself over to them.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And they have had
astonishing experiences where

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:84%
they went to another
world, and they unanimously

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.960 align:middle line:90%
agree that this was real.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So what really got
to me, eventually,

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.980 align:middle line:84%
was just saying, well, if
all my friends agree and they

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.890 align:middle line:84%
say they've been
there and I hear,

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:84%
all the time,
doctors who tell me

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.830 align:middle line:84%
that they empathically
coexperienced

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:84%
the near-death experience
of their patient,

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.960 align:middle line:84%
then I am in a point
where the most I can say

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:84%
is that there does appear
to be an afterlife.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And I am a long way
from understanding it,

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:84%
but it gives me a motivation
to keep on in my research

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.280 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure
this out, and how

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:90%
to make rational sense of it.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.370 align:middle line:84%
I've always liked
writing humor things.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:84%
When "Life After Life"
came out in 1975,

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:84%
my publisher was a
little bit distraught,

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.640 align:middle line:84%
because he was
afraid that somebody

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:84%
might find some of my earlier
humor works, and thinking it

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:84%
was just another
joke I was doing.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.260 align:middle line:90%
But that didn't happen.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
strength of my work

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:84%
was that having been
through philosophy training

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:84%
before I wrote that
book, that I knew

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:90%
what you couldn't conclude.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And that rather than making
some sort of statement

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.970 align:middle line:84%
about proof of life after
death, that I held back,

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and that I confined to what
could logically be done,

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:84%
which is to accurately
describe the phenomenology--

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.970 align:middle line:84%
the elements and
characteristics--

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:54.950 align:middle line:84%
of a near-death
experience, and that

00:27:54.950 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that opened up a lot of other
research on this same topic.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And I have never had anybody
relate to me personally

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:08.520 align:middle line:84%
the story of an
interstellar reincarnation,

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:84%
but I sure hope that
something like that

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:15.860 align:middle line:84%
is true, because I
have always been trying

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.570 align:middle line:90%
to get out into outer space.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And if I could be assured
that I'm going to go out there

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.240 align:middle line:84%
when I'm dead, then that
might make me rethink

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.380 align:middle line:84%
my thoughts about the afterlife,
because I mean, like I said,

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really very enthusiastic
about the reality of this.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know if I
want there to be an afterlife

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:42.410 align:middle line:84%
or not, and I don't know,
even, how to figure that out.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:46.880 align:middle line:10%
But it's a very hopeful
prospect, to me--

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:10%
the idea that I could
do what I've always

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:10%
wanted to do anyway, which is
to be an interstellar explorer.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And I could do it just
by the process of dying,

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.010 align:middle line:90%
that would be a great thing.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.700 align:middle line:84%
My research and thought
over 50 plus years

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.350 align:middle line:84%
suggests to me that
basically, what a human being

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:84%
is is a conscious entity that
really appreciates narrative

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and story, because what
are you but your story?

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think the essence of
the identity of a person

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:90%
is that person's life story.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:84%
I sure hope that my children
remember me favorably.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want to be
remembered-- as a good father,

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.190 align:middle line:90%
and with all my failings in it.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it's entirely
personal-- my kids,

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and my grandson is how I
would like to be remembered.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.060 align:middle line:10%
In terms of
professionally, I would

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:58.110 align:middle line:10%
like to be remembered
as a scholar is

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:03.360 align:middle line:10%
that I would say that
this guy, Raymond Moody,

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:15.120 align:middle line:10%
took 2,300 years of
assumptions about nonsense,

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.850 align:middle line:10%
and turned them
around and showed

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:22.710 align:middle line:10%
that meaningless, unintelligible
language is not something

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:10%
to be reviled and debunked,
but rather is something

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:31.260 align:middle line:10%
that can be a key to the
understanding of consciousness

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.290 align:middle line:10%
itself.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to be remembered
as the student of philosophy--

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:84%
because I don't like to
call myself a philosopher.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:84%
A student of philosophy
who figured out

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:51.990 align:middle line:84%
how to think logically and
intelligently about things

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:55.370 align:middle line:84%
that are meaningless
and unintelligible.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:31:06.347 align:middle line:90%
