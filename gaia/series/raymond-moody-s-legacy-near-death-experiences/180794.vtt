>> I'm Raymond Moody.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And these are my thoughts
on near-death experiences.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Near-death experiences
are a common pattern

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
of conscious experience
that occurs to people

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:90%
who are on the verge of death.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, in a
cardiac arrest from which

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.590 align:middle line:90%
they are resuscitated.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:10%
And basically they
consist of elements that

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.380 align:middle line:10%
are common all over the world.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:10%
Not every person has
all of the elements.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:84%
But among the things
that people say

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.900 align:middle line:84%
are that they hear the
doctors say something like,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, he's dead--

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:90%
or we've lost her.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Which is very
surprising to them,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
because they say
that I have never

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
felt so alive as when I heard
that doctor say I was dead.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Because from their
point of view,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.900 align:middle line:84%
they feel that they
distance themselves

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:90%
from their physical body.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And they watch the scene
of the resuscitation

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
typically from a point
of view above it.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:84%
As this progresses, they
eventually wake up to the fact

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, this must be
something to do with death.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, they enter
into states of consciousness

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
that no matter how
articulate they may be,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
they say there are
no words for it.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.950 align:middle line:84%
That it's ineffable,
or indescribable.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:84%
They go through a passageway
into a beautiful light.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
They feel comfort,
peace, and joy.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:84%
They meet relatives and friends
of theirs who have died.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And they go through
panoramic memory,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:84%
in which everything
they've ever done

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:84%
is displayed around
them in a sort

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:84%
of holographic,
three-dimensional panorama.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:10%
And they come back
from these experiences

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:10%
with a total new take
on life, thinking

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:10%
that the most important thing
we can do while we're here

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:10%
is to learn how to
love, and saying

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:10%
that they have no
more fear of death,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:10%
because they feel
that death is just

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:10%
a transition into
some other reality.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody who comes
close to physical death

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
has a near-death
experience in the interim.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:10%
And it's very difficult
to get an estimate of what

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:10%
percentage of people do.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:10%
Because somewhere between 20%
and maybe 50% to 60% of people

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:10%
who come close to death have
a near-death experience.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.820 align:middle line:90%
But not everybody reports it.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And also, we have no idea
why some do and some don't.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, some ideas that you
might have naturally, like it's

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:90%
the religious basis, right?

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.710 align:middle line:84%
However, religious people
do, and religious people

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:84%
don't have near-death
experiences.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Or people who say that they
had absolutely no exposure

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
to religion prior to a cardiac
arrest may have an experience.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't seem
to have anything

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:84%
to do with the age
of the patient.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
have anything to do

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:84%
with the illness or injury that
brought somebody to near death.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So we really don't know
why some do and some don't.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the more
puzzling features

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
of near-death
experiences is that it

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:84%
happens fairly regularly
that while they are out

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.240 align:middle line:84%
of their body in the hospital,
the patients will tell us

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
that they go to some
other part of the hospital

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even some place
outside of the hospital

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
entirely and are able accurately
to report what happened.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
For example, I had this
wonderful friend, Vi Horton,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
who had a cardiac arrest during
surgery for a gallbladder

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and had a cardiac arrest that
lasted 20 minutes, according

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:90%
to her doctor.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, when Vi was
out of her body,

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:10%
she was going out in the
hall in the hospital.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And in an area of
the hospital, she

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:84%
saw her brother-in-law, who
was standing there alone.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And as she was watching him,
a friend of the brother-in-law

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:84%
came up and said, what
are you doing here?

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And her brother-in-law
said, well,

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I was going to Athens
today to see Uncle Henry.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But it looks like Vi is
going to kick the bucket.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'm staying around to be
a pallbearer at her funeral.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:10%
Several days later,
when her brother-in-law

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:10%
came to the hospital to visit
her after she was revived,

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:10%
Vi said to him, well,
the next time I die,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:10%
I want you to go on to Athens
to see Uncle Henry because I

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle line:10%
will be fine.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed that
brother-in-law at depth

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said that totally
changed his life.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
fairly common thing

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
that patients will
tell us these things,

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:84%
seeing things about
the resuscitation scene

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:84%
that they shouldn't
have been able to see.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.880 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty is how in the
world do you establish that?

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.970 align:middle line:84%
There have been these schemes
of let's put things up

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.110 align:middle line:84%
on the shelf above in a
resuscitation room, so

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that if the patient happened
to be out of their body,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and they could report
this, then we would know.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:84%
But you see, I am
both a medical doctor

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:90%
and a philosophy professor.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things
that I hear coming out

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
of medical doctors' mouths
about thinking through things

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
like this are
extraordinary to me,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:84%
because there are
enormous difficulties

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of approach.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I have even heard some people
say that we could prove life

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:84%
after death if we could get
a few of these verifications

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.100 align:middle line:90%
from a distance.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
But the trouble is
that that in no means

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
would show that there
is a life after death,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
because it wouldn't prove that
after the body was finally

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:84%
irreversibly dead
that this could occur.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And also because
near-death experiences

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.810 align:middle line:84%
of a transcendent nature occur
in some dimension of reality

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.650 align:middle line:84%
that is totally displaced
from this physical realm

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:90%
that we're in.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So you couldn't
prove the existence

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
of a transcendent
life after death

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:84%
by proving that somebody
saw something while they

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:90%
were out of their body here.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not trying to say
these aren't impressive.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do feel
that they occur.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:84%
The next step is,
well, how do we know?

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very difficult
thing to establish.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So what I would say
in answer to the

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
what is it that leaves your
body at the point of death?

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.900 align:middle line:84%
It is the "I" that is the
subject of your story.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as
you're out of your body,

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:90%
you're out of this story.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And I had a famous
actress, Broadway actress,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that I knew who had
had this experience.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And she had had a
role on Broadway

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:84%
that she played for a
long period of time.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And she became
identified with the role.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And she said the last night
she walked off the stage

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and she was leaving
that role behind,

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:84%
she said then flash forward
to her near-death experience.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And she said that was
as close as she could

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:90%
get to a description of it.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like that getting
out of your body

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.400 align:middle line:84%
is just getting out of this
role that you're in and headed

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:90%
towards some other role.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.610 align:middle line:84%
But in some cases you get
pulled back into the same role.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And people say that
it is very difficult

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.940 align:middle line:84%
to describe what is that
transformation of identity that

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:84%
takes place when you go from
this realm of existence, which

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:84%
is time and space, to a state
of existence that is not

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:84%
based on temporal
or spatial features.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But rather, the
closest people can

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
get to it is they say it's
like information and love,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:84%
that everything is either
information or love.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And that whereas in
this world, in order

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.200 align:middle line:84%
to get a piece of
information I might

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:84%
have to go to a computer or a
book, that in that dimension,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
apparently just to formulate
the thought that you

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
want to know something
zaps it into your purview.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is about as
far down on the word scale

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
as you can get in terms of
getting a definition of it,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.490 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
narrative-directed.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
That is, in your life, when
some new event takes place

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:84%
in your life that you're
conscious of, what

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:84%
you do is you weave it into
your longer life story.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:84%
When you get out of your
body into this other realm,

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:84%
you still at that point
still have some contact

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:84%
with this culture that you're
in and the narrative that you're

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to
know is, what about

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:84%
when you get into a
timeless, faceless existence?

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Because a narrative
necessarily involves

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:90%
the notion of time and space.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.180 align:middle line:84%
If there's no time
and space, how

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:50.980 align:middle line:84%
could you continue anything like
the kind of conscious existence

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:90%
we have now?

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And I just really have to say,
I'm baffled, and I don't know.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But what I am really
impressed by is people

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
that I've talked with who've
had these experiences,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:90%
they say they still exist.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:90%
They're still themselves.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there's no
time and no space.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how to
put that together yet.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Near-death experiences affect
people very profoundly.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And they have certain kinds
of predictable effects.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
The most dramatic
one is that whatever

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:90%
they are chasing in life--

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and I have spent my
life chasing knowledge.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Some people spend their life
chasing power or money or fame

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:90%
or any of these other things.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's striking
to me that whatever

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.920 align:middle line:84%
they have been chasing in
life, when people come back

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.880 align:middle line:84%
from this experience, they say
that what this is all about

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:90%
is learning to love.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And they say that is what comes
forward in your life review.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I also
immediately want to say

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that they say also that it
doesn't make that any easier.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:84%
My friend George Ritchie,
the first living person

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I ever knew who had
had this experience,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:84%
said, Raymond, this experience
makes your humanity,

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:90%
even more of a burden in a way.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And to translate George's
words into my vernacular,

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:84%
because I've heard this
from a lot of people, what

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
he was saying is,
let's face, it's

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
very difficult to get
through the average day

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
without wanting to choke at
least one other person, right?

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:90%
And that reality stays the same.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So they come back realizing
the importance of the quest

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:84%
to learn to love and yet
still find themselves

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:90%
in a human situation.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.930 align:middle line:90%
So that's one after effect.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.300 align:middle line:84%
The other after effect
is people say that it

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:90%
eliminates the fear of death.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Not that they would want to die
in a painful or unpleasant way,

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:84%
but from their experience, they
interpret death as a transition

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:84%
into some other and more
desirable realm of existence.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So they have no
more fear of death.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, another after effect,
which is much rarer,

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.020 align:middle line:10%
but there are lots
of cases of it,

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:10%
because there are lots of people
with near-death experiences,

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:10%
but it is inspiration
to artistic creativity.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.500 align:middle line:10%
For example, in
upstate New York at NYU

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:34.070 align:middle line:10%
is Dr. Anthony Cicoria, who is
PhD in physiology, and an M.D.,

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:38.680 align:middle line:10%
and an esteemed professor
of orthopedic surgery.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:10%
And in 1996, Anthony,
at a family reunion

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:10%
was struck in the neck by a
bolt of lightning in a telephone

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:10%
booth and had a cardiac arrest,
and got out of his body,

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.970 align:middle line:10%
went around and was able
to accurately report

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.400 align:middle line:10%
to the people in
the family reunion

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.470 align:middle line:10%
what they were doing while
he was out of his body.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:84%
But after he came
back from this,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:84%
developed an interest in the
piano, which he had never

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
had before, and kept having
a recurrent dream in which he

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
was playing the same piece
of music on a concert stage.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And then a friend of his just
one day came by and said,

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going out of
town for a year,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and I need somebody to
take care of my piano.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Would you do it?

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:10%
He said, well, OK.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:10%
So he started taking
piano lessons.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.550 align:middle line:10%
And now, in addition to
being an esteemed professor

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:10%
of orthopedic surgery, Anthony
is an acclaimed concert

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.447 align:middle line:10%
pianist.

00:13:40.447 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:10%
I've interviewed quite a
number of people over the years

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.820 align:middle line:10%
who, after their
near-death experience,

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:10%
had some new talent that
they didn't know about.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And the most common
one is people

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
say it makes them more
perceptive about other people.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I remember this woman
named Frances Stokes who

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.710 align:middle line:84%
was a receptionist for one of
my dad's medical friends, who

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
told me about her near-death
experience when she was 11.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And she said after that she has
this, not like a psychic thing,

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:90%
but this ability.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:84%
She said, for example,
when she steps

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:84%
on an elevator with somebody,
that she can sort of

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
feel their being and maybe feel
some of their pain or something

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.110 align:middle line:90%
or what's going on with them.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:90%
And I hear that a lot.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that creativity
is a part of us

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with some
other realm of existence.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
That is definitely
how it feels to me.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think creativity,
I can easily

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.230 align:middle line:84%
imagine why that would be
something that would be stirred

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.840 align:middle line:90%
up by a near-death experience.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:10%
There is one
inference you can make

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:10%
from near-death experiences
with complete certainty that

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.690 align:middle line:10%
is astonishing.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
this life review.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Because people say
at a certain point

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:84%
that the physical environment
kind of disappears,

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
they've ever done

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:84%
is surrounding them in a
sort of holographic panorama.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And that there is no time,
that they're in a standstill.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:84%
No time, and everything they've
ever done is there around them.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And when they witness
it, they don't review it

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:84%
through the eyes they had
when they did the action.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Rather, they are
embedded empathically

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:84%
in the consciousness
of the person

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:90%
with whom you interacted.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So in this review, if you've
done something hurtful

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to somebody, then
you are that person

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and you feel directly
and empathically

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:84%
the sadness you brought
about in that person's life.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Or if you did something
kindhearted to someone, then

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:90%
you feel the good feelings.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, knowing that, we
can make an inference

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:84%
from that that is
really quite startling.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is that at
least for some of us,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:84%
life is a two-phase
process, right?

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:84%
First, we go through it forward
as the actor, or protagonist.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.670 align:middle line:90%
Then time stands still.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:90%
There's a 180-degree turnaround.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And you witness the same
actions from the point of view

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.790 align:middle line:90%
of the other characters.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Now to me, this is
extraordinary in itself,

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:84%
that we can know for sure
that at least for some of us,

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:90%
life is a two-phase process.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:10%
Now, beyond that, what happens
is that somebody who comes back

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:10%
from that, therefore, are
they in a third phase of life?

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Ancient Greek
Philosopher Heraclitus

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:84%
said they were,
because he talked

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
about these people who had been
apparently dead and returned.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And what he said about
them was that these people

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:58.550 align:middle line:84%
are appointed to watch over
the living and the dead.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is often
the feeling that I

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:84%
get from these people with
near-death experiences,

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that they're kind of
one foot in this world

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:90%
and one foot in someplace else.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:84%
And so how did they
get back from this?

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, the story varies.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Some people say
they have no idea.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
At one moment, they were in
this light and then this state

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.270 align:middle line:90%
of heightened consciousness.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:84%
The next moment, they
were back in their bodies

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:90%
with no sense of transition.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Then another group of people say
that somebody there told them

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.470 align:middle line:84%
you have to go back-- it
could be a dead relative;

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:84%
it could be this being of
complete compassion that

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:90%
they're with--

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:90%
that you have to go back.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And they say, I don't
want to go back.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.190 align:middle line:90%
But they're forced to go back.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Because they said,
you're not finished yet.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Very frustrating
for them is the fact

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:84%
that they never are told why it
is that they have to go back.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.370 align:middle line:84%
They are not told what
they have to finish.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:84%
In the passage of
time, they often say,

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I can see now why
I was sent back.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.740 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have access
to it at that time.

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
A third group are people
who are given a choice.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:middle line:84%
They say that they
were told, you

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:84%
can either go on
with the experience

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:84%
you're having, or you can
go back to the life you've

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:90%
been leading.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And not too surprising-- all
the ones I've talked with who,

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.920 align:middle line:90%
you know, chose to come back--

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:84%
but the reason they
give is phenomenal.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And that is in
almost every case,

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:84%
it is that they come back
on behalf of somebody else.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.920 align:middle line:84%
They say that, for
myself, I wanted to stay.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:90%
But I chose to go back.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And most commonly,
it's because they

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.860 align:middle line:84%
have young children
left to raise

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.720 align:middle line:84%
or some other loved
one that they feel

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.940 align:middle line:90%
that they need to take care of.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a really interesting
thing when people see

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:90%
their relatives who have died.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this creates
all sorts of paradoxes.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:84%
One is, for example, they
say that they don't see them

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.960 align:middle line:90%
at any particular age.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
They say that it's
that you recognize

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:84%
that that is the person who
was Aunt Matilda or whoever.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like you
see a physical presence.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And nonetheless, it has a
kind of geometry, like a form,

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and that you recognize
from the feelings

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and the memories who
this is, despite the fact

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:84%
that there's no
physicality to it.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that, as many think,
after a near-death experience,

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:90%
there is reincarnation.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So what sense does it
make that Aunt Matilda may

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.550 align:middle line:84%
be reincarnated
somewhere in Nebraska,

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:42.232 align:middle line:84%
but that she is appearing to
me in my near-death experience

00:19:42.232 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:90%
as Aunt Matilda?

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.740 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, these
contradictions do sort of

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.380 align:middle line:84%
vanish, however, if you
think about the fact

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that this is a timeless
framework of existence.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.940 align:middle line:84%
The reason why there appears
to be a contradiction between

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:84%
saying that my aunt appeared to
me in a near-death experience

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and is nonetheless
reincarnated at that time--

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.270 align:middle line:84%
that is only
contradictory if you're

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.600 align:middle line:84%
assuming that there is
such a thing as time.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the neat things
about being in my age,

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:20.060 align:middle line:84%
which is 74 now, is you realize
there is no such thing as time.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I had figured that
one out as a philosophy

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:10%
undergraduate.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:84%
But here, it really
becomes an item

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
of immediate personal
experience at a certain age.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So time is just part of
the framework of this thing

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:90%
that we're in.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.150 align:middle line:84%
It does not really have an
independent existence apart

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:90%
from the physical dimension.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And people in
near-death experiences

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.710 align:middle line:84%
say that the state of
consciousness they are in

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a time component.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:84%
People regularly tell you
that they chose to come back,

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
that they were given a
choice to come back or not.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:90%
And they chose to come back.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that raises some
interesting anomalies

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:90%
for the medical profession.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Like you spend all of this
time in your education,

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:84%
and you spent all this hour
trying to revive the person,

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and then the person
comes back and says,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:90%
oh, I chose to come back.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.412 align:middle line:84%
Well how do you fit these
two things together?

00:21:16.412 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And a matter of
fact, I would go on

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:84%
to say that they don't
have a clear solution,

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle line:84%
as long as we stay within
the framework of Aristotelian

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:84%
logic, that we've got to
learn how to think logically

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.120 align:middle line:84%
about things that are
beyond the literal

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and don't make
any literal sense.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:84%
To me, the most
interesting single aspect

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.560 align:middle line:84%
of the near-death experience
is the life review,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.350 align:middle line:84%
that somebody could
go through experience

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and see everything
they'd every done

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
and review it from
the point of view

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:84%
of the other people involved,
and that no time passed,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.060 align:middle line:84%
and that it totally
changed their lives.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.010 align:middle line:90%
That, to me, is just phenomenal.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Negative experiences occur.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And they are much
smaller in number.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
The Gallup poll that was
done on this in 1979,

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.930 align:middle line:84%
is I remember the 3, but
I can't remember if there

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:15.610 align:middle line:90%
was a point in front of it.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's either 0.3% or 3% of
the experiences they gathered

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.810 align:middle line:90%
were negative.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And that coincides very nicely
with my experience with this.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are all
kinds of questions

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:90%
that come up with this.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Number one is, is this an
under-reporting problem?

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, personally I would
be very reluctant to say,

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.890 align:middle line:84%
you know, Doc, when I
died, I went to hell.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So maybe not as many
people report that.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And then another
difficulty with it

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is that, whereas the positive
near-death experiences seem

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:84%
more homogeneous,
the negative ones are

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:90%
spread out all over the place.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:84%
There doesn't seem to be an
internal coherence to them.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And there are three major
categories of negative ones.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:84%
One, in which it starts just
like any other near-death

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:90%
experience--

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:84%
all the same things--
except rather

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:84%
than feeling it to be a good
thing, that people experience

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:90%
it dysphorically.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But then as it proceeds,
then it changes

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:84%
into a positive
near-death experience.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Another type in which there
are hellish visions and flames.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And those seem to be
the rarest of all.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I talked to an
elderly man who had

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:51.280 align:middle line:84%
been riding on the back of
a wagon when he was a kid.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And he fell and had some
sort of horrible head injury.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:90%
And he had visions.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:84%
He said it was like there
were these puffs of flame

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:90%
jumping up all around him.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But it was just very
vague, you know,

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:90%
and not anything very specific.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.480 align:middle line:84%
The ones that I've heard are
just very patchy like that.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not like anything.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like what I would
call a delirium, where

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.300 align:middle line:90%
the images may be very vivid.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:27.364 align:middle line:84%
But they don't really
fit together very well.

00:24:27.364 --> 00:24:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to lots of people
with near-death experiences

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:middle line:90%
because of suicide attempts.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And the common factor is that
they say that they would never

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:90%
attempt it again.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked
them why, they say

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.270 align:middle line:84%
it's not because
they felt that they

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.270 align:middle line:84%
would end up in any sort
of hell or anything.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:10%
But rather, that just
as with any other thing

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:10%
you've done in
your life, that you

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:57.440 align:middle line:10%
would have to witness the
after effects of your action

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:10%
on your loved ones
who were left behind.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And also people
saying-- and in fact,

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:84%
a couple of people have
used the same analogy--

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that it was kind of like walking
out in the middle of the movie.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.961 align:middle line:84%
That if it had completed,
that the sadness would

00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:84%
have been that they
would never have

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:21.080 align:middle line:84%
known how that particular
life would have played out.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:10%
People who go through
a near-death experience

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:28.340 align:middle line:10%
definitely don't come back with
the idea of the Old Testament

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:10%
God and the raging and
the fury and so on.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:36.050 align:middle line:84%
People describe a being of
complete compassion and love.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago, I went to
China and then to India

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.850 align:middle line:90%
a year or so later.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:10%
And in both cases,
I was expecting

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.900 align:middle line:10%
to hear something different.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But what I was astonished by
was that I heard the same thing

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.990 align:middle line:84%
in India, for example,
with the Hinduism,

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
as I hear in the United
States from people

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.620 align:middle line:84%
who are Jewish or
Christian or whatever.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the
religion aspect of it

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:90%
really doesn't factor into it.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Except that people will say--

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:84%
they say, since
there are no words,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:84%
then I'm forced to use the
words from my tradition.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like that
it's the words don't really

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:84%
have that sense they
do in their religion.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And people say that
after this they

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:84%
have no more interest
in denominations

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
or that there is more of a
personal relationship with God,

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:84%
rather than an
ideological religion that

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.080 align:middle line:90%
comes to the fore with this.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Culture may play a role in the
articulation of the experience.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But it usually comes
with the admission

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.330 align:middle line:84%
that it's not adequate,
that it's just the only ones

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:90%
available to them.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So where you're
from doesn't matter.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like being a human being is
pretty much the same all over.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And not to degrade cultural
things, which are wonderful,

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:01.820 align:middle line:84%
but we are still just
these basic beings.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I definitely think that
near-death experiences

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.610 align:middle line:90%
do transcend culture.

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.970 align:middle line:84%
All over the world, there's
this collective story

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:84%
of leaving one's body and
going on a sort of trip.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Like it's basically
a travel narrative,

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:84%
if you think about it, like
a journey to another world.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's a very strange
paradox involved in that.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is that we all know
the meaning of a travel story.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:90%
We all love travel stories.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But doesn't the travel
story depend for its meaning

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.770 align:middle line:90%
on space and time?

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very
real disconnect there.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.430 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the
situation we are

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:46.370 align:middle line:84%
in with near-death experiences,
because the story is

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:90%
very moving.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.729 align:middle line:90%
I got out of my body.

00:27:48.729 --> 00:27:50.270 align:middle line:84%
I went through a
tunnel into a light.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I came back to my body
and returned to life.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.290 align:middle line:90%
That's a travel narrative.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But the whole presupposition
is that it's not

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.100 align:middle line:90%
spatial or temporal.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.992 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.992 --> 00:28:03.460 align:middle line:84%
The question that
obviously arises

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:84%
is what relationship do these
near-death experiences have

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:10.420 align:middle line:84%
to the experiences
people have under DMT

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.260 align:middle line:84%
or various kinds of
psychedelic agents and so on?

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.140 align:middle line:84%
One very interesting thing
about those compounds

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:23.690 align:middle line:84%
is that they exist in
relationships to human beings.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it would make a
certain amount of sense

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.840 align:middle line:84%
that we would seek things
in the environment that

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:34.270 align:middle line:84%
would reproduce this amazing
experience that we have.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I am completely
confident in saying,

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.760 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the physical
world is an illusion.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me sound
psychotic, and that's all right.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Because if they haul me
away to a mental hospital,

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
that's an illusion too, and
maybe a very interesting one,

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:50.410 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're not
putting the world down

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.460 align:middle line:90%
by saying that it's illusory.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.310 align:middle line:84%
To me, it just
gradually dawned on me--

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and after talking with thousands
and thousands of people--

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:90%
that this is a reality.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.700 align:middle line:10%
For years, I just didn't know.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I accepted perfectly
that the people were telling me

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.860 align:middle line:84%
the truth, that they
were being sincere.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And I also knew
that it had nothing

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:84%
to do with oxygen
deprivation to the brain,

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:84%
because one of my own
medical school professors

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.360 align:middle line:84%
told me about having
this experience

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:84%
when she was
resuscitating her mother.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is an illusory
narrative-driven thing

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.080 align:middle line:90%
we're in.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And where I have
come in my thinking

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:40.030 align:middle line:84%
about it is that apparently
we finish this one story,

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and then we go through some
incomprehensible process,

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and then, I gather, we're
back on another storyline.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:51.100 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've never had an interest
in convincing anybody else

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.300 align:middle line:90%
that there's an afterlife.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.700 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of what
I think, I'm in.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to my utter surprise,
there is a life after death.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And what I would advise
people on the basis of that

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.780 align:middle line:84%
is slow down a little
bit and enjoy life,

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.560 align:middle line:84%
because this is a really unique
and interesting experience.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.650 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
out of it alive.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have some
really interesting things

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.650 align:middle line:90%
to review in your life.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.840 align:middle line:90%
So don't be afraid of death.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not anything
to be scared of.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But stay here as long
as your sentence is.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Because when you get out of
here, it will make sense.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:46.294 align:middle line:90%
