at the time where I really

was living with her for,
like, about five years.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.819 align:middle line:84%
And she kind of had
suffered with me

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:90%
through this whole thing.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:84%
She was getting into a lot
of Deepak Chopra and yoga

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to go
live in community.

She wanted to experience nature.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:84%
She was really getting into
the whole spiritual aspect

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't like New York.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to get
out of New York.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:90%
She was sick of New York.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.461 align:middle line:90%
She had finished with New York.

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And I had, too, but
I needed to create.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And I had to get that
carrot, the carrot.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.660 align:middle line:90%
I was after the carrot.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So finally, she
decided, that's it.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:84%
She decided she was going
out to this artist commune

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:90%
in this New Mexico desert.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I'm going.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:90%
And I was, like, I couldn't.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But I was, like, why would
anybody go to New Mexico?

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Is that even like a
part of this country?

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I was just completely
baffled why

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
anybody would want to go there
and especially, you know,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.389 align:middle line:90%
in the desert.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:90%
So she went to New Mexico.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe it, totally
shocked the hell out of me.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Went out to this place
and left me there.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.629 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
completely flabbergasted.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to do.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.045 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how I would get
out there, why I would even

00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:90%
leave New York.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:90%
My family was there.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.738 align:middle line:90%
How could I ever leave?

00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:90%
How could I quit my stuff?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:84%
How could I change
my life and do that?

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:90%
It would be impossible.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And I finally decided
OK, I'm doing this.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.420 align:middle line:90%
I sold everything.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:90%
I just quit everything.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.574 align:middle line:90%
I got rid if the apartment.

00:02:39.574 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:90%
I just left New York.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:90%
And I went out to this--

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:90%
I took this plane.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Probably, I think, I'd been
on a plane once in my life

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and went out to New Mexico,
completely sick to my stomach,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and had to take this little,
like, two-men crop duster

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty ridiculous.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we went out to
this desert in New Mexico.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:90%
She was waiting for me there.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:90%
And I get there.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.035 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so happy to see her
because I hadn't seen her

00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:90%
for six months.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.540 align:middle line:84%
But I knew when I got
there, something was up,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.680 align:middle line:84%
that something
just wasn't right,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.721 align:middle line:84%
because she wanted me to
come, but something just

00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:90%
wasn't right.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So two days later,
she burst into tears

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.044 align:middle line:90%
and said she had met somebody.

00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I was, like,
it was only three weeks

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:84%
since I had talked to her and
said I was going down there.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.543 align:middle line:90%
She had met someone.

00:03:17.543 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:90%
I was, like, what?

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.044 align:middle line:84%
She goes, yeah I'm
in love with him.

00:03:21.044 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, I should
have told you.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And this big Native
American guy came I came up

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and he started putting all
her stuff in the truck,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
and they basically took off
and left me in this community.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.850 align:middle line:90%
And I was, like, oh, no.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:90%
What am I--

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:90%
I was in complete shock.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.845 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to do.

00:03:37.845 --> 00:03:39.477 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of just
started walking,

00:03:39.477 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:90%
because I was in complete shock.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And I walked along
through this desert

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:90%
for literally the whole night.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And I wound up at this
kind of motel next

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:90%
to this liquor store.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.115 align:middle line:84%
And I was so distraught and so
embarrassed and so completely--

00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:55.510 align:middle line:90%
I had gotten rid of all my--

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
you know, gotten rid of all
my connections in New York

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and just said, I'm
not coming back.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm gone.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I was too embarrassed
to even admit

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
that I'd just got out
there for a couple days,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.480 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't know what to do.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just went to
the tailspin and just,

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
like, drank, like, Cuervo
Tequila and listened

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
to Perry Como tapes for the
next two months which was, like,

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.329 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) and I love you so
just over and over again.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:90%
Completely went crazy one day.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And I started running through
the forest completely naked,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:84%
started running
through the forest.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:90%
I ran into this river.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I was just walking
through this river.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.531 align:middle line:84%
And the current
completely took me away.

00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was, like,
[MAKES DROWNING NOISE],,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and I completely
wound up getting lost

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing where I was,
and the night had passed.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see anything.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:90%
It was pitch dark.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And I actually slammed
this rock, bam,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:90%
and it knocked me out.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:90%
And I woke up.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.150 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in the morning, and
I completely just wanted to--

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if I wanted to
die or whatever, just, like,

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.464 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be there.

00:04:55.464 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in the morning, and
there was literally this elk

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:90%
standing over me.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And I was, like, ah!

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And I completely didn't--
it was these brown eyes,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.230 align:middle line:90%
and I completely looked at it.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.760 align:middle line:84%
It was apparently just
standing there watching

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:84%
over me or some bizarre
thing which I couldn't really

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.820 align:middle line:90%
even begin to conceive of.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And so when I woke up, when
I saw that, for some reason,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:84%
it completely took
my breath away,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:84%
it completely changed
my perception.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I actually kind of was looking
at it, and it nodded at me,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:90%
and it walked down.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I was like, holy shit,
did this just happened?

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:90%
And I went up on this--

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I stepped-- I pulled
myself onto this ledge.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was-- hours had passed.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I could
breathe for the first time.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And I actually was
watching the sunset.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time in my life,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I could actually notice
that how blue the sky was

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and how the sun was
playing off these cliffs.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:84%
It was changing
color constantly.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:84%
It was amber,
orange, red, purple,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and it was just
constantly changing.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:84%
It was completely
amazing the way

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
these shadows were
playing off the cliff.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.697 align:middle line:84%
And how blue and how
alive the sky was.

00:06:07.697 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Like, in New York, you
never even see stars.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:90%
It was just forever, this thing.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately-- I
just wanted to grab,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
wanted to keep this
whole thing, wanted

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.117 align:middle line:84%
to keep this whole scene
because I wanted to be there,

00:06:20.117 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
because it was first
time I'd actually

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
realized that there was
something besides me.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.995 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa.

00:06:25.995 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to let it go.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.744 align:middle line:84%
I wanted just to
have, like, a picture.

00:06:28.744 --> 00:06:32.079 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:90%
So eventually the moon came up.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.472 align:middle line:90%
I realized it just--

00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:90%
everything had changed.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
you can't actually

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.814 align:middle line:90%
hold on to these things.

00:06:38.814 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
time I actually

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
had that validation
of that feeling

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.936 align:middle line:84%
that it's all kind of
changing and it's all--

00:06:46.936 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:90%
it just comes and goes.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.507 align:middle line:84%
And you can't hold on, and you
can't grasp, and you can't--

00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:54.090 align:middle line:84%
whatever happens
just kind of happens.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:90%
You have to kind of let it go.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:90%
And that was basically it.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:84%
I got that realization and went
back to New York after a while.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.720 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:84%
It allowed me to
actually understand

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:84%
things in an experiential
level that had an effect on me

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:84%
as far as the way I
lived my life after that.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't perfect.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't like a saint
or anything like that,

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.340 align:middle line:84%
but I definitely understood
more about letting

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:84%
go and about things
being other, not New York

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:90%
being not the only thing.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And the reality that
we have in New York

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:90%
wasn't the only reality.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.734 align:middle line:84%
Into that mind frame of running
and running and running.

00:07:36.734 --> 00:07:37.650 align:middle line:90%
And I got to get here.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:90%
I got to get there.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I got to go.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think I can do it
without becoming completely

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:84%
overrun by it is the
word, I guess it would.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I can be it, and I can
almost be with it--

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.000 align:middle line:84%
almost be with it rather
than have it rule over me,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:84%
basically, rather than have it
dictate my constant running.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So I think in that respect, that
pretty much changed everything

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:90%
in the way I relate in New York.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And in general to
people, I think

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
I had a deeper
relationship with people.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.534 align:middle line:84%
My relationships
became much deeper,

00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:90%
I think, more than anything.

>> I'm best known as the author
of "The Art of Sexual Ecstasy,"

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:84%
"The Art of Sexual Magic," and
"The Art of Everyday Ecstasy."

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.556 align:middle line:84%
I have published in 18

00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:51.640 align:middle line:90%
many, many books.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And people know me as a
teacher of ecstatic sexuality.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And I brought to the
West the teachings

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
of Tantra, which is the art
of living a blissful life.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So having taught so many
people, people often

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
imagine that I have
a flawless love

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:84%
life and a perfect marriage
and perfect relationships.

like every other woman

in the world, at
least 50% of them,

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:28.930 align:middle line:84%
the experience of
divorcing my husband.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one that declared
that it was time to divorce,

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and we loved each other
a lot, but we're just

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:84%
not made or meant to
really fit with each other.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.476 align:middle line:84%
And so after many
upheavals having

00:09:44.476 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
to do with different
perspectives

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:84%
on sacred sexuality
mainly, and I

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.270 align:middle line:84%
would say different
perspectives on integrity

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.250 align:middle line:84%
around sexuality, not to
go deeper into the subject,

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I declared that I
wanted to divorce.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And we were literally
half a day away

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.160 align:middle line:84%
from going to the Himalayas
with a group of friends,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.860 align:middle line:90%
and we had planned that tour.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:84%
They were all there--
united couples.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And here we were,
about to separate,

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:84%
going on a journey
of one month to do

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:90%
a pilgrimage in the Himalayas.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Hilarious, right?

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to
make the best of it,

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:90%
and we had a tantric divorce.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And we had an ecstatic divorce
if that would ever be possible.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Now granted, for us,
it was fairly easy

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:90%
because we didn't have children.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.470 align:middle line:84%
We had been together
six years, and it

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.760 align:middle line:90%
was time for a separation.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So what was so incredible is
that we could have one month

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.150 align:middle line:84%
together to do it, and
that we used everything

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.050 align:middle line:84%
that we went through as
a way to fully live out

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:84%
the grief, the anger, the
reproaches, the difficulties

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:90%
of our separation.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So I picked the most incredible
places like on top of a glacier

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:90%
with a view over the valleys.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And I called him
forth, and I said,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.820 align:middle line:84%
let's have a ritual of cutting
the energy cords between us

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:84%
so that we could
create, energetically,

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:84%
a separation while we have
this incredible view around.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Or let's sit by the
waterfall and imagine

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.780 align:middle line:84%
that the water is washing
through our spirits

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and taking away all the
difficulties that we

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:90%
have gone through.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And so we sat by the
waterfalls holding hands.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Another time, I created,
literally out of the blue,

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:84%
an incredible quarrel
because I knew we

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:90%
had a lot of anger to let out.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So I told whatever
story I told so that we

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:90%
could get mad at each other.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we were totally mad
at each other, screaming.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
incredible catharsis.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.400 align:middle line:84%
We needed to go
through a catharsis,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:84%
following which, he booked
a room in the best hotel

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:90%
in Dharamsala.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And we had a night of love
that I will never forget.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So we went through all the
difficulties and all the pain

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:84%
but somehow, it was such
a graceful way of ending.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we went
our separate ways.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:90%
He went to Nepal.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:90%
I went back to America.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Then the trouble started.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.010 align:middle line:84%
I actually realized that
I never really wanted

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:84%
to look into the
deeper layers of grief.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I was in Holland
working on my next book,

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, my
body fell apart.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I felt I was becoming old and I
was bloated and I was half sick

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.770 align:middle line:90%
and I had no energy.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:90%
That's not me.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm hardly ever like this.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't quite understand
what was happening.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So I looked inside
deeper and deeper,

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that there
was a layer of grief

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:84%
about the separation that I had
never allowed myself to feel.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to start
with yoga and with diet

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and with exercising and with
really taking care of my body.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And I went into
complete brahmacharya

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
or sexual abstinence for five
months just being by myself

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and really taking care of
myself and looking inside

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and meditating and going more
into releasing my ex beloved.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And when that was finished, I
came back home only to hear,

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:84%
as I was feeling better,
that he was coming back

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.170 align:middle line:84%
to live in this
area for four months

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:90%
in the same area in California.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And no sooner was I feeling
just about stabilized,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:90%
that I get an email and a call.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Can he see me?

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:90%
And there he was.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Ha, I tell you, it was really
something to see him again.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:90%
But that was a turning point.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at him in his
eyes, I had to tell him this.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know,
this is the first time

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
that I can tell you
that I'm grateful to you

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:84%
for all the troubles that I went
through in our relationship.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I experienced so much
grief, so much anger, so much

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:23.775 align:middle line:84%
anxiety about whatever I thought
you were putting me through,

00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:25.232 align:middle line:90%
and now I own it.

00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:26.440 align:middle line:90%
That was the way I responded.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I could have
responded differently.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.990 align:middle line:84%
But still, I went
so deeply into that,

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
that now I feel
like I'm vaccinated.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Nobody could ever-- who would do
the same things or would behave

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:90%
in the same way--

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:84%
nobody could ever
touch me again.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:90%
I would be free of it.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:84%
If these things happened again,
I could breeze through them

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle line:90%
without any trouble at all.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And so in a way, I
have gained in freedom

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:90%
and I have gained in wisdom.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And even those troubles
that I went through

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:84%
were like a gift of
wisdom for which I'm

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:84%
grateful because I feel
so much more free with men

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:84%
now, so much less
attached and needy

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and a need to control and
be sure that everything's

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.410 align:middle line:90%
going to go right.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And so in a way, that
is a strange thing.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
sometimes, the moments that

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.260 align:middle line:84%
bring us the deepest pain,
the deepest difficulty,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:84%
are also the moments that
bring us the deepest wisdom

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and that put us so in
touch with ourselves

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that if we live them fully,
we are free of them forever.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Existence doesn't
need to bring us back

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:84%
the same thing, the
same situations,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:90%
because we are done with it.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.060 align:middle line:90%
And so that's my story.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So those of you out there who
are in a difficult relationship

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.370 align:middle line:84%
or who are declaring that
it's time to divorce,

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:02.320 align:middle line:84%
remember my story, and maybe
you will feel inspired by it.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it's even
possible to have a tantric

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.265 align:middle line:90%
or an ecstatic divorce.

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:12.833 align:middle line:90%

>> I'm a gay male.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And in my relationships in the
past, what has happened to me,

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and what I have found that
has occurred all the time,

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.480 align:middle line:90%
is a repetitiveness.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Relationships, for
whatever reasons,

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:90%
they were always ended abruptly.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, there was no
closure on their relationship,

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and I never got to say the
things that I would necessarily

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
wanted to say with that
person in order to move on

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:90%
to the next relationship.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And what happened from that is
that I carried that baggage, so

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.924 align:middle line:84%
to speak, with me from
relationship to relationship.

00:16:50.924 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:10%
There's been a lot of sadness
that's come up for me.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because
my expectations--

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.609 align:middle line:84%
it's not that they
weren't met but what's

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:07.490 align:middle line:90%
happening is not those things.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
Last year, last
summer I met someone.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And I planned a picnic
with him, and I remember

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.926 align:middle line:90%
my stomach was in knots.

00:17:18.926 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:84%
We had been dating
about a month.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt
strongly about this guy,

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.452 align:middle line:84%
and I had not felt that
way in a long time.

00:17:27.452 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And we had been dating, as
I said, for about a month,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.670 align:middle line:90%
and I made a picnic lunch.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:36.057 align:middle line:84%
And there was
something going on.

00:17:36.057 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:90%
There was attention.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.780 align:middle line:84%
There was whatever
you want to call it,

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:44.180 align:middle line:84%
something there that
wasn't real for how we

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:90%
had been over the last month.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him about it.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me that he didn't
feel the same things for me

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:84%
as I had felt for him in
the area of going forward

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.870 align:middle line:84%
with a physical and
sexual relationship

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.956 align:middle line:84%
but that he loved me, and
he cared a lot about me.

00:18:04.956 --> 00:18:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he actually
used the word love,

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.371 align:middle line:84%
but he cared a lot about me,
and I meant a great deal to him.

00:18:09.371 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.500 align:middle line:90%
My history came up right then.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And I got this look
at the fact of,

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, here is that feeling of
rejection one more time, Ira,

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and let's see what that
looks like right now.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:90%
And I listen to my friends--

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%
I heeded my friend
Irene's words,

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and she said look at the
bigger picture, and I did.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:42.810 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So I remember calling
him a day or two later.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And I got to say to him all
the things that I have ever

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:55.890 align:middle line:84%
wanted to say to anybody in
the ending of a relationship.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And it brought great
closure to my past.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And it has changed
forever the way

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I look at relationships
and the way I hold them.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And this man is somebody who is
in my life, always in my heart.

Spiritually, we will
always be connected.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%

he will always love me.

depressing for me.

It's futile being
where I live now.

never realized was there.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:90%
And I cried a lot last summer.

And, like, my stomach where I
used to store all that stuff

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
was, like, uh, you don't want
to know how horrible that was.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean, it's
not anything, per se,

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.620 align:middle line:84%
that I said to him
that cleared it.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:90%
It was the act of saying it.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It was all of this stuff
that that signified.

>> Holding a strength,
holding a validity,

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
a validation of something rather
than a fear of something like

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.296 align:middle line:90%
dismissal.
