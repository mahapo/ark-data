want to tell you my story.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:84%
About 15 years ago, I developed
a rash on my knee-- actually,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.985 align:middle line:84%
something that you
would think would

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:84%
be something you
could go to the doctor

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:90%
for and get rid of quite easily.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:84%
But I went to several, several
doctors over about a one

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:84%
month period and
nobody could tell me

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
why I had this crazy rash
outbreak on both of my knees.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Then that went away and I
started getting sore throats.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Every time I went to the
doctor for my sore throat,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
I was given an antibiotic that
worked while I was taken it,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:84%
but as soon as I
stopped taking it,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
the sore throat came back worse
than it was the first time.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
This happened over a
couple month period

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:84%
until finally, by the time
I had my fifth sore throat

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and went back to
the same doctor,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
she told me she had to
give me an antibiotic.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
She only had one
left to give me.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.699 align:middle line:90%
Very, very strong.

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:02.740 align:middle line:84%
She was a little concerned
about giving it to me,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:84%
but she didn't know
what else to do.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So she gave me this antibiotic,
I went and got it filled out.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time,
I read the paper--

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.852 align:middle line:84%
the leaflet that comes
with the antibiotic.

00:02:14.852 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even
know why I did it.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Just something told
me why don't you

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:90%
read this and see what it is.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Come to find out it
was an antibiotic

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:84%
that was so strong that
they gave it to people

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:90%
who had venereal diseases.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.060 align:middle line:84%
That scared me, and
I didn't take it.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really
glad that I did it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
because I feel that if I had,
I would be dead right now.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Miraculously, the sore throats
kind of went off on their own.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:84%
But what took place was I
started getting joint pain.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:84%
It started in my
knees and the doctor

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:90%
said it was torn cartilage.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to go in and
apply surgery to my knees.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Something told me don't
do that, and I didn't.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I did some physical
therapy, instead.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But the knee pain
never really went away,

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.060 align:middle line:84%
but your body starts
getting used to pain.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:90%
And it adapts.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:90%
And you put up with it.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Then over a five-year
period, what

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%
happened to me was the
pain spread from my knees

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:84%
into all of my other
joints until my joints were

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.280 align:middle line:84%
so bad that I literally,
could not even

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:84%
hold the phone to my
ear for more than five

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.315 align:middle line:90%
or six seconds at a time.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.100 align:middle line:84%
If I did do that, my whole
arm would stiffen up.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I would have to pull it
out-- pull my fingertips out.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So what I started
doing was when I

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:84%
had to have phone
conversations, I

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
would put the phone on the
bed and I would lay down

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.720 align:middle line:90%
and talk into it that way.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't carry a
purse in my hands.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't carry bags.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I just, over the years,
learned to live with pain.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:84%
All the time going to
conventional doctors,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:84%
the doctors never
were able to find out

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:90%
what was wrong with me.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had one
doctor actually tell me

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:90%
I had too many symptoms.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was just too
confusing for her.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:84%
So I kept looking for different
doctors and different doctors.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:10%
I must have gone through, over
a five-year period, probably

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:10%
15 doctors.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.965 align:middle line:84%
That I would try for a while
and they would give me thyroid

00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:44.710 align:middle line:90%
tests, Lyme's disease tests.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Give me all kinds of
different medicines

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:90%
they thought would cure me.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
I was very confused

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't understand
how or why I was feeling pain.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I was always a very,
very healthy person.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Very energetic.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.950 align:middle line:90%
And very bubbly and happy.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I would wake up in the morning
very excited about the day.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But as these pains
started setting in,

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:90%
I started withdrawing.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And I started to wish
that I wasn't here.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Not to wish that I was--

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
not that I would end my life,
but I started doing things

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:84%
like, leaving my
car unlocked when

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.465 align:middle line:90%
I had to drive down to Miami.

00:05:30.465 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Wondering what it would be like
when I drove across the bridge

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:84%
if my car accidentally
steered itself

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:90%
off and landed into the water.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I really-- I started
scaring myself

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
with the thoughts that were
going through my head that

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
had me recognizing that I
was wanting my life to end

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:90%
because the pain was so bad.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:84%
One day, I ran
into an old friend

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:90%
who I hadn't seen in a while.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And when I had known this
friend, he had diabetes--

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.980 align:middle line:90%
very bad, actually.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
He was taking lots
of medication.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:10%
And last time I had seen him,
it was very difficult for him

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.030 align:middle line:10%
even to walk.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And I ran into him and here
he is, 70-year-old man.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Very energetic, nice
tan, looking great.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying to him,
what happened to you?

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Last time I saw you,
you looked like you're

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:90%
ready for your deathbed.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And now, you look like
you're 40 years old.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So he told me about
this alternative doctor

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that he was seeing who
happened to be a heart surgeon.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So he was a conventional
doctor to begin with--

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:84%
a heart surgeon--
who now was studying

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic medicine,
which is what we call

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:90%
alternative medicine over here.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So I just was
praying please, let

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:84%
me hold on long enough to get
to see this doctor and see.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the last chance--
the last person

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I will go and see
if they can help me.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the
doctor and I remember

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.657 align:middle line:90%
I was on the second floor.

00:07:14.657 --> 00:07:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And I remember waiting
for the doctor,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:84%
looking out the glass
window at this willow tree.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And the branches were just
gently swaying with the breeze.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking
looking at those branches

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and just wishing that I could
be one of those branches hanging

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:90%
off of that tree.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Just without any pain.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Without a care in the world.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Swaying in the breeze--
that's what I wanted so bad.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, the doctor came
in and he sat me down.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And he put his hand
on my wrist, which

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
is Ayurvedic medicine--
they take a pulse here.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.940 align:middle line:84%
There's three different
pulses and it tells the doctor

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.110 align:middle line:90%
what's happening to you.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.540 align:middle line:90%
So he sits down.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.940 align:middle line:84%
He takes my wrist, doesn't
say anything to me.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:90%
Says hello, but then that's it.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Closes his eyes and he just
sits for a couple of minutes.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, he opens his eyes
and he tells me a number.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what?

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:90%
He says a particular number.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, I realized that
he was giving me a year.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
He said I'm telling you the
year that your illness started.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even stop
to think about what

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.210 align:middle line:90%
year did all this happen.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I knew how many
years I'd been sick.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was I counted
back and I realized, oh, my god.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.320 align:middle line:90%
He hit it right on the head.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the year
that my rash started

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:90%
and I started getting sick.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, I felt this
relief come over me.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this
was the one that I

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:84%
was guided to come to see him
because he was going to help

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.240 align:middle line:90%
me go back towards health.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.695 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:03.695 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So I agreed to do
everything that he said.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I started on an
exercise routine.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:90%
I started taking up yoga.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.930 align:middle line:90%
He taught me sun salutations.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:90%
He taught me about meditation.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:90%
About visualization.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.840 align:middle line:90%
About diet.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:90%
The importance of water.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of real simple
things that I was amazed I

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:90%
had never been told about.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.370 align:middle line:84%
After a few months of
my new lifestyle change,

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I woke up one day and
was talking to my mom

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
on the phone, all of a
sudden, I recognized--

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and I even said to
her-- my, god, mom,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:90%
how long have we been talking?

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.064 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, I don't
know about 15 or 20 minutes.

00:09:58.064 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said wait,
hold on a second.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And I took the phone down and
I'm doing this with my arm.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.723 align:middle line:90%
And I realized, oh my god.

00:10:02.723 --> 00:10:03.854 align:middle line:90%
There's no pain there.

00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And pick the phone
back up and I'm

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.500 align:middle line:84%
really excited because it's
like, it's unbelievable.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:90%
It's all gone.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.500 align:middle line:90%
It's just-- it's gone.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:90%
And I was so excited.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:84%
I felt as if 500 pounds was
lifted off of my shoulders.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Literally, I felt like
I could float away,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
like I had to hold myself
down or I would float away.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And everything from
that day forward

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:84%
started looking
different-- everything.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.650 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
You see, nobody can heal you,
except for yourself-- that's

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.630 align:middle line:90%
what I learned.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's a physical
and mental thing.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.510 align:middle line:84%
In other words, don't
become a vegetarian

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:90%
and still hate the world.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if you haven't
changed up here,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't learned to love
people with all of their faults

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and accept them, then it's
going to be very difficult.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I always thought
that the perfect life

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
was one that was always happy
with no pain and no suffering.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned from
my illness and my recovery

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.790 align:middle line:84%
is that there is no such
thing as a life without pain

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.760 align:middle line:90%
and suffering.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what I learned to do was
embrace it and learn from it.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I do.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So when the
challenges come along,

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.800 align:middle line:84%
instead of thinking
of it as a problem,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I see it as a new way for
me to learn something else

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:90%
about myself and the universe.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Because if I had
never gotten ill,

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I never would have
come into this new life

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and this new awareness
with my eyes being

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:90%
open to so many things.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just so much less
judgmental than I used to be.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.510 align:middle line:90%
I accept a lot of things.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And I hate nothing,
even the hard times.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't hate them.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:16.315 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate them as
a learning experience.

00:12:16.315 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I think my story as beginning
when I was three months old

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and came down with eczema,
which is a skin disease

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:90%
that both of my parents had.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And my mother asked my
father for a divorce the day

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:90%
that I was born.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And my skin has been a
barometer of stress in my life.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I was three, my father
moved my three older brothers

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:90%
and me to New York.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And I spent a month
in the hospital.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And my hair came out and I
had sores all of my body.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So that was my first
hospitalization.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
age of 10, I also

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.320 align:middle line:84%
lost my hair from pulling it
out because my scalp itched

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:90%
so much.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.089 align:middle line:90%
And I had it all over me.

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
doctors discovered

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:84%
that I responded very
well to cortisone.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they gave me shots,
and pills, and so forth.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.539 align:middle line:84%
And then for 35
years, I used creams

00:13:28.539 --> 00:13:30.830 align:middle line:84%
to keep the eczema at bay
whenever there was a problem.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.980 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Five years ago, I
moved to New York City

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:84%
when my youngest
son went to college.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And I met a very wonderful
professor of art history

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:90%
and I married him.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.589 align:middle line:90%
And my skin got bad right away.

00:13:49.589 --> 00:13:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And it got worse
and worse and worse.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So bad that I really could have
been in the hospital, again.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:10%
This time, I didn't
want to use cortisone.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And I had been pursuing a lot
of different healing modalities.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And he told someone
that I was an invalid.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And I went to him and
I said, do you really

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.747 align:middle line:90%
think I'm an invalid?

00:14:12.747 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm running around and
doing a lot of stuff,

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really an invalid.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:10%
And he said but you are
because you don't eat normally.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.202 align:middle line:84%
And you don't--
nothing is normal.

00:14:23.202 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I was on a very
restricted diet and so forth.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said I admire your
tenacity, and your enthusiasm,

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and your optimism, but
you've got a chronic illness.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have this
for the rest of your life.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was then that
I realized I had

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:90%
to leave this marriage, too.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:43.180 align:middle line:84%
That I could not deal with
being viewed as an invalid.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked him
for separation a year

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and a half ago.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And have continued to pursue
a variety of different--

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.420 align:middle line:90%
acupuncture and healers.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:84%
In any way, the
good news is that it

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:90%
lifted about a month ago.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.270 align:middle line:90%
It has stopped being a problem.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm eating normally and not
having reactions from the food.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.350 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have the pieces
figured out yet at all,

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
but I think also, that a
very important piece for me

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
was that when I was a little
girl and suffering badly

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:84%
with eczema, I had
a wonderful nurse--

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.760 align:middle line:84%
a governess who came
from Sweden, named Eva.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And Eva believed
very much in God.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.609 align:middle line:84%
And told me that I
could pray and that I

00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:90%
would be helped through prayer.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And that has been invaluable
to me over my lifetime.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Not that I have
believed consistently,

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:84%
but over the
decades, I have come

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:84%
to absolutely believe that there
is a force working to help us.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
are forces that

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.190 align:middle line:84%
work to repair psychic wounds,
as well as physical wounds.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, I have found
prayer enormously helpful.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
One image that I had that was
important to me was that when I

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:24.100 align:middle line:84%
was in what some people call
the dark night of the soul,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
during the time
after my father died,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and my marriage had broken up,
and my mother-in-law whom I

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.630 align:middle line:90%
adored had died--

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I felt as though I was in the
bottom of an empty swimming

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:90%
pool--

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:90%
a very deep swimming pool.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.030 align:middle line:90%
And that I couldn't get out.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But what would happen was
that handles would appear just

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:90%
when I needed it.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.420 align:middle line:90%
There'd be a rung there--

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I guess, maybe a thing to
put my foot on, as well.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So that I was just gradually
able to climb out of that pit.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
But my skin has
cleared up since then.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So I used to say to people,
you got to listen to your body.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
You've got to really
pay attention.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.710 align:middle line:84%
But I found it impossible
to face it myself

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:90%
for many, many, many months.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I saw it
in talking to a friend who

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:90%
said, how are things going?

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of one
lunch, I said, oh my god.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I am so miserable and I've
got to leave the marriage.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the thing
that I say to people when

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:84%
they are really,
really depressed

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
is that it's very hard to have
perspective on where you are.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.049 align:middle line:84%
And that if you believe
that you can get better.

00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe that
you're going to be helped

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and that the universe
is a friendly place,

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.090 align:middle line:90%
that makes a lot of difference.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:90%

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So how it all
weaves in together--

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:84%
But in a very
simple way, I guess

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I would say that when my
skin is giving me trouble,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I need to really try
to understand, what are

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:90%
the feelings that I'm avoiding?

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:16.285 align:middle line:84%
That's probably clear that
I'm not wanting to feel sad.

00:18:16.285 --> 00:18:19.194 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.194 --> 00:18:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's awfully hard to
see that when you're in it.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.963 align:middle line:84%
I think of it as trying
to help me see something.

00:18:27.963 --> 00:18:33.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
When I was 33 years old,
I had a medical crisis

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:90%
and developed a heart disease.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And the heart
disease, essentially,

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:84%
was a narrowing of the
left ventricle of my heart

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:84%
which caused
shortness of breath.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to
gain any weight.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:90%
I was tired.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I had very dark circles under
my eyes most of the time.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:84%
All along this time, I was
not really able to function.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And previously, I had
been pretty physical.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I saw for myself
that I was really

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:84%
in a fight for the
life situation.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Emotionally I was saying,
my heart is broken.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And why did this happen to me?

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So I began to learn
more about what it was

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:90%
that was causing this problem.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:90%
It manifested in a physical way.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Yet, what was really going
on were some very basic core

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:57.757 align:middle line:84%
issues emotionally that
came from my childhood.

00:19:57.757 --> 00:20:01.030 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:84%
I was a very responsible
child because my mother

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:12.030 align:middle line:84%
had had a medical crisis,
also, when she was very young.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I didn't
get the nurturing

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and the sense of mother
love that most children had.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.515 align:middle line:84%
So I took on the role of
taking care of the family

00:20:27.515 --> 00:20:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and, by no mistake,
was I a nurse.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, when
I became very ill,

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I began to bring people
into my life that

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:84%
would be able to give me the
kind of nurturing fulfillment--

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:84%
all of the things that
little children learn.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And so, I learned to
talk about how I felt.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:58.590 align:middle line:90%
And what my needs were.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.175 align:middle line:90%
And have a vision for my future.

00:21:02.175 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I was a nurse.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I certainly took the
teachings from the doctors

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and used the medicine and
helped myself in that way.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And also, went other routes
to work on the core issues

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:90%
that I needed to work on.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So I began to study
yoga, to learn more

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:32.440 align:middle line:84%
about who it was that I was
inside me on a spiritual level.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:37.900 align:middle line:84%
By opening up my heart to
connecting with other people,

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:84%
being willing to learn from
the environment, or nature,

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:53.288 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, who I was as a
woman helped to heal the heart.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Today, I have my own private
practice within my home.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Last August, I was married.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm 56 years old.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:84%
These things I-- at
one point-- would never

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:15.350 align:middle line:84%
have thought that I could
really have accomplished.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And it is related to
the heart disease.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:25.105 align:middle line:84%
To the core issue of
not having been loved.

00:22:25.105 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
The heart condition
that I developed

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:90%
is no longer in existence.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no symptoms
of the heart disease.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So I mended that heart
through the lifestyle change.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:50.585 align:middle line:84%
And today, am seeing that in
my life on a regular basis.

00:22:50.585 --> 00:22:54.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.950 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Choice is everything and
everything is choice.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
doing is that I'm

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:07.250 align:middle line:84%
choosing to create what
it is that's best for me.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:10.000 align:middle line:90%
