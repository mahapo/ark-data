About five years ago, I
lived on the Rosebud Sioux

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Indian reservation
with my ex-husband,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:90%
and this is my story.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm of French, Mohawk,
and Abenaki descent,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and I met my ex-husband at
a powwow in Massachusetts,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
married him, and
moved out to Rosebud.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:84%
When I married Jim, I thought
I was marrying a older

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:84%
spiritual person, and
I was soon to find out

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't the case.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I spent almost two
years of physical abuse.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The abuse was so severe
that he would tell me

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:90%
when I could answer questions.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:84%
He basically destroyed
any past life experience--

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.270 align:middle line:90%
you know, my families--

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and he tried to kill
me several times.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And my saving grace was
the Lakota religion.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.640 align:middle line:84%
His brother, Florentine, one
night went to go to ceremony.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.940 align:middle line:90%
He's a medicine man.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And I had two children
with me at the time.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And my children and I
couldn't go to the ceremony,

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
but Florentine said that
everybody would pray for us.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And about 3 o'clock
in the morning,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
I was laying on the couch,
and I heard the door open.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And I looked and
the door was closed.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.560 align:middle line:90%
And then I looked at the clock.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:90%
It was 3:01.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And I felt the circle of
cold air blowing my face,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and I was very scared, so
scared that I couldn't yell

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And there was no one
there except my children.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:90%
And my hair was blowing back.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt like someone's
warm hand touched my head,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and I felt warm all the
way down to my feet.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And then a voice
inside my head said,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Jim will go back to where he
came from, and you will be OK,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:90%
but you will be hurt some more.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
By the time I woke
up in the morning,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I thought that I had
imagined the whole thing.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Florentine came home
about 7 o'clock,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:90%
and I went to greet him.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And he took my hair, and
he said, what happened?

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It looks like you rode
in the back of a pickup.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that
I hadn't dreamt that.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, a lot of
people pray for you tonight.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And about 3 o'clock, Elmer
sent the spirits out to check

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:84%
on the people that
were prayed for.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Did you notice anything?

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was kind of when
my life turned around,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:84%
when I believed that there
was a spiritual world.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:84%
The abuse continued, but right
before his big plan to kill me,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.780 align:middle line:90%
the federal agents came in.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
He was hauled off to
prison, and I found out

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that he had spent
17 years in prison.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So, in essence, the
spirits were right

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.910 align:middle line:84%
that he did go back
to where he came from.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:84%
He came from
prison, and now he's

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.110 align:middle line:90%
in a federal prison for life.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:84%
I knew that he
served time, but what

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I was told by the New
Hampshire parole commission

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:90%
was that he was framed.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And Jim said that he
never killed anybody,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:90%
and I believe that to be true.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe that someone
could commit the brutal murder

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:90%
that he did.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:84%
But after they hauled
him off to Sioux Falls,

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I was actually able to go
in and read that whole case.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And there were
family witnesses that

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:84%
came through to verify that they
saw him murder his first wife.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
From that point on, the
Lakota women and medicine man

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and his wife on the
reservation helped me

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
with my own spiritual
healing, because I have

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.800 align:middle line:90%

through a glass table.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%

what triggers it,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's getting better
as the years pass.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was lucky that I was
given a pipe to pray with.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%

I also pray for clarity.

things, when I pray, I

clarity and understanding.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:90%
and they said I was evil.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:84%
They said I shouldn't
know what I know.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:84%
They said I shouldn't
see what I see.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:90%
So I closed down more.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:84%
They brought me to the
medical profession.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.930 align:middle line:84%
The medical profession said,
well, let's do CAT scans.

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's shoot dye.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if we can find tumors.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:90%
So it was test, test, test.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, I started to feel more
and more just like an object,

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't belong.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.782 align:middle line:84%
I was, I could just
say, terrified.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:58.578 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So they sent me
to the psych ward.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And then once at the psych ward,
they didn't know what to do,

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.069 align:middle line:84%
because I did a great job on the
block test, on all the tests.

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't quite get
it, but they thought, well,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:90%
maybe let's give her some--

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:90%
you know, put her on something.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So they started putting
labels on me there.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to
sort of believe it.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I also thought,
well, if what I'm

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.960 align:middle line:84%
seeing is really true, if I'm
really seeing people glow,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
if I'm seeing thought forms,
I'm seeing like little entity

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:84%
things at different times,
I was preferring there

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:90%
be something wrong with me.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.451 align:middle line:84%
Because then, at least,
I fit in somewhere.

00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:90%
I had a label that fit.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:84%
When I was 15, my sisters,
two of my sisters, drowned.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle line:90%
It was my younger sister.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:90%
She was nine.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And then my older
sister, who was--

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:90%
she was about 21.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.450 align:middle line:90%
And we had gone to Sicily.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It was our whole family,
except for my father

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and another sister who
lives in Guatemala.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So we went to Sicily to
visit, and we were going down

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:84%
to the ocean to swim, because we
were all really good swimmers.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.330 align:middle line:90%
And I had a feeling.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Something said, you know,
I'd rather stay on dry land.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:90%
I just had those senses, anyway.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But we went down,
and we went swimming.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:84%
My little sister was
walking along the beach,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:90%
and the undertow took her out.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:90%
My older sister went in.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And myself and my two brothers
went in and got shot out again.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, by this time,
other people grabbed us.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it was my sister,
my little sister,

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:90%
out there and my older sister.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:90%
My sisters drowned.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do
anything, just watched.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, it was a real
powerful turning point for me

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.800 align:middle line:84%
That was the time I
decided I wanted to live.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Because before
that, I was between.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
lot about why I fought

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.530 align:middle line:90%
inside myself to keep going.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:10%
Because in what happened
with them and their deaths,

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.400 align:middle line:10%
somehow it clicked,
and I want to live.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:90%
And I kept going.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:90%

do the math for Barbara Brennan

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:90%
and Pat Rodegast in Phoenix.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.704 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea who they were.

00:11:35.704 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
that world was about.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But something, the impulse
inside, said, you have to go.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:90%
You have to go.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, what
I did was meet Barbara,

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and she told me her story.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:84%
She let me know I was
psychic, I was clairvoyant,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't crazy.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.780 align:middle line:84%
was, who they told
me I was, I wasn't.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and teach channeling
classes, which is just

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:84%
about getting people in
touch with their inner knower

and, actually, just
their god selves.

who they are

doing it, you know.

fluid enough to do that.

>> I think it was 1968, I was
in the county jail out in Santa

Rita, Alameda County Jail.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was the lead man
on a mob crew out there.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And my job was to see
that people mop the dining

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
hall at the end of
each meal and also

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:84%
to see that no one walked
on it until it was dry.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So I looked up and I saw
this big, tall white guy

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:90%
walking across the floor.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And I just immediately
assumed that one of the guards

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
had sent him to do
that to challenge me.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I assumed that he was from the
Aryan brotherhood or Nazi party

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, because they
generally would pit us

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.439 align:middle line:90%
against each other that way.

00:14:06.439 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So when I saw him
walking across the floor,

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:84%
I immediately knew
that it was trouble.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:90%
I ran over and I challenged him.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of looked at me
really puzzled and said, well,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.290 align:middle line:90%
where else am I going to walk?

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:90%
You know, what are my options?

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:84%
The floor, the
ceiling, or the walls?

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.620 align:middle line:90%
And he kind of shrugged.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.225 align:middle line:90%
And I had this flash of anger.

00:14:27.225 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I just immediately said,
let's take it to the mop room.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So we get into the mop
room, and I'm standing down.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.670 align:middle line:84%
But there was just something,
I don't know it was,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:90%
that made me ask his name.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.690 align:middle line:90%
He said Mario.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I still wasn't sure
what I was going to do

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:84%
or how this was
going to play out.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I was in a very defensive
posture, ready to pounce.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Then, he asked me my name.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Trustan.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.990 align:middle line:90%
I thought, darn.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:84%
I said, hey, man,
they called me Touche.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And this dude grabbed me,
grabbed me by each shoulder,

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.740 align:middle line:84%
looked me in the eyes,
and said, Trustan?

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a beautiful name.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.600 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to call you Trustan.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.286 align:middle line:84%
Just really threw
me off balance.

00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it didn't seem
like the kind of thing

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.290 align:middle line:84%
that somebody who was
intending to harm me would do.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So I took a closer look,
and just something about him

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:90%
was familiar.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Mario?

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Mario?

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Are you Mario Savio?

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has to be.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And actually, when we
left the mop room, I mean,

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.530 align:middle line:84%
I obviously didn't hit
him or beat him up.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.695 align:middle line:84%
When we left the mop room,
the floor was still wet,

00:15:40.695 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and we both walked on
the floor together.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:90%
And so I started talking to him.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.600 align:middle line:84%
He asked me how could he
help me, what was my problem.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.780 align:middle line:84%
He had no idea that I had
asked him into the mop room

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.390 align:middle line:84%
to beat him up, or at
least to fight him.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And from that day
on, I don't think

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:90%
my life has been the same.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I was in for attempted
murder, and Mario was in

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.910 align:middle line:84%
because of his leadership
and the free speech movement.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I had grown up in Louisiana, and
I had relatives in Mississippi.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that had
impressed me about Mario when

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
I first read about him was
his activities in Mississippi

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:84%
as part of the Freedom Rides
and the Freedom Summers.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.070 align:middle line:90%
So I felt an affinity to him.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, I felt ashamed
that I had ever challenged him.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I
didn't realize it,

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:84%
but it was the beginning
of a lifelong friendship.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
After I was released,
I became homeless,

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and I moved into his
home with his family.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:90%
And that ended up being--

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I ended up living with
him and his family

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:84%
for approximately
3 and 1/2 years.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had a seventh
grade education.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, well,
you're not working.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you start auditing
classes at UC Berkeley?

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.470 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I
would understand them.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:90%
He got the books for me.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I started auditing physics
classes, history classes.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:84%
And from that, I decided
to go back and get my GED,

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:90%
and now I have college classes.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.520 align:middle line:10%
From meeting Mario
Savio, I would

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.920 align:middle line:10%
say that everything in my
life has been different.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have more of
an interest in other people

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:84%
who are in
downtrodden positions.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:84%
If I hear about someone
on the radio who

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.860 align:middle line:84%
has a problem or something's
going wrong in their lives,

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't hesitate to
write to them, if I

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:90%
can find out where they are.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I have a very strong interest in
the women political prisoners.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I write to a woman,
Marilyn Buck,

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.680 align:middle line:84%
who's out at the Federal
Correctional Institution

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:90%
in Dublin.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:90%
She's a political prisoner.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I have more of an
interest in that than I do

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:90%
making money or being famous.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I think Mario set
a good example,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.020 align:middle line:84%
just in the way that he dealt
with me in that mop room.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:84%
My friendship with him
didn't end at his death.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm an organic gardener,
and I made a commitment,

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
after Mario's death, that I
would take care of his family's

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:90%
garden until I died.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:84%
I was really proud that
I was able to speak

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.780 align:middle line:90%
at the big memorial in Berkeley.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't met Mario, I
would probably be dead by now,

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:90%
because I was a bully.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:90%
I was vicious.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
I was always trying to make
sure that I got the upper hand

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:90%
and got my way.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:90%
I'd do anything to get my way.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And everyone else
that I knew that I

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
was close with from that
era, they are all dead.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I suppose the other option
is that I'd probably

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:90%
be on death row.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But I certainly wouldn't
be live in a rewarding life

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and having a good relationships
that I'm having now.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:84%
If I was alive, someone
would be after me.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And certainly,
the type of people

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.269 align:middle line:84%
I know now, I would
have never known before,

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:84%
because I would have scared
the hell out of them.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone I
knew was just like me.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.450 align:middle line:84%
From the day that I met him,
everything began to change.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Like the things that I began
to question, the things

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:84%
that I no longer
were willing to do,

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle line:84%
the things that I learned to
do that I wouldn't have ever

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.300 align:middle line:90%
learned.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he had a
tremendous impact on me,

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:90%
and he still does.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like, in dance,
I've learned how to listen

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:84%
to my body more than I ever have
before and let it play and let

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:49.540 align:middle line:90%
it teach me.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So as I look for
my path in life,

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.200 align:middle line:84%
instead of looking outward
and trying to find someone

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:84%
to give me the right
job or the perfect place

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
to put myself into
externally, I've turned inward

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:08.155 align:middle line:84%
and allowed what was in
me to speak and to move.

00:20:08.155 --> 00:20:12.190 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I work in New York
City, and I have

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.660 align:middle line:84%
a story about going
to Kauai, which

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:90%
is an amazingly magical place.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was going,
actually, to break up

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
with my boyfriend
in Hawaii, which

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:84%
is a terribly strange
thing to do but, actually,

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:90%
a good place to do it.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:84%
We found ourselves on this
unbelievable mountain hike.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:84%
We hiked up into
the Waimea Valley.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the rainiest
place on the planet,

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
but for some reason, it
was clear and beautiful.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we got up to
the very tip of where

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:84%
we had planned to
hike, we popped up

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
in this beautiful,
sweet poi, which

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:84%
is a fruit that is
hard to describe.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's just sort of mushy,
sweet, heavenly wonder.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And I ate this fruit
there and walked back

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:07.640 align:middle line:84%
along this very muddy, beautiful
pathway back to our car.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And as I was walking back
in just ecstatic state,

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I told myself that I had to
do everything in my power

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.660 align:middle line:84%
to protect the Earth's
beauty, because it was just so

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.760 align:middle line:90%
astoundingly beautiful there.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And just as I said the
word beauty in my mind,

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:90%
I slipped on the mud.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was then,
too, that I felt

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:84%
like there was the
possibility of slipping up

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:90%
at any moment in this task.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.781 align:middle line:90%
And I got back to the car.

00:21:32.781 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:84%
My boyfriend was
in a terrible mood.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that
I hadn't had enough.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't yet say
goodbye to this landscape.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So I left him in the
car and ran back out

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
to the overlook, where we
could see where we had hiked.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, as I
looked back along the ridge,

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.870 align:middle line:90%
a rainbow had formed.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was ending right at
the spot where we had hike to.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So it was another
sign of, for me,

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.390 align:middle line:84%
just to follow my own
dream, no matter what.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And now, I am
planning on finally

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.630 align:middle line:84%
making that seed of a
dream come true and start

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.595 align:middle line:84%
working in the communications
field environmentally,

00:22:12.595 --> 00:22:15.650 align:middle line:84%
so I can help tell the
stories of the planet

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and the crises facing the
planet to the people who

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:22.310 align:middle line:84%
can make a difference
and help protect

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:27.040 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful, heavenly
planet we find ourselves on.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the analogy
of one's body and taking

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:84%
care of one's body
is very much in line

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:84%
with our need to take
care of the planet.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And that was sort
of what happened

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:90%
when I slipped on the path.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:84%
It was, potentially,
a really scary slip.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a
big ridge, and I

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:84%
could have tumbled down hundreds
of feet into the jungle.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
It was in that moment, too, that
I had the sense that I needed

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.260 align:middle line:84%
to take care of my physical
being in the same way

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and respect and honor my
physical being in the same way

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to
honor the Earth's.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And that it was very much
metaphorical and connected.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So dancing my way into a
new way to serve the planet

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:90%
is my task and my joy.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:90%
