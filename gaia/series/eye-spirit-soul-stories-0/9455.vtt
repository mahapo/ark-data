00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I work here at
Omega Institute,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:90%
and I'm 32 years old.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So I used to be kind
of a shy person.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a
lot of self-value

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.315 align:middle line:84%
and had been raised in
kind of a difficult family.

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
But in any case,
I ended up feeling

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
like I didn't have a lot
of self-value or self-worth

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.550 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So I was living my
life doing my thing

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and having unhappy relationships
and jobs I didn't love,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:90%
stuff like that.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:90%
So anyway.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:90%
I was 29.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that I had
a really swollen lymph node.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:90%
I was on vacation.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the doctor, and it
turned out to be throat cancer.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I was
29 at the time,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'd been a
vegetarian for 10 years.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was doing
all the right things

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:90%
and feeling pretty healthy.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.081 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I think the first
thing that anybody

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.150 align:middle line:84%
thinks when they hear cancer
is that you're going to die,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.185 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it turns out that
so many people survive

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that it's not really
a death sentence,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:90%
but it feels that way.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And it just feels like, how
could this be happening to me?

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm so young.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it was a rare
cancer for someone my age.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:90%
And so, yeah, I was stunned.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.942 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, I had
to tell my family, which

00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:90%
was the worst part of it all.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.461 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, nobody wants to
hear about your daughter

00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:41.835 align:middle line:84%
or your granddaughter
has cancer.

00:02:41.835 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:90%
And so it was terrible.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I really had no idea how
difficult it was going to be.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad I didn't
know in the beginning.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But I was diagnosed
with the cancer.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing thing is that
the people in my community

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:90%
came to help me.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
All of my friends
gathered in a way

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that I just never knew
how much they cared

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:90%
for me until this happened.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And they became like a
little army of helpers.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
They organized support
groups for themselves.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
They invited me to tell
them exactly what I needed

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:90%
and when I needed it.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And regularly,
food, and company,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and rides to the doctor,
and everything else

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
started showing
up at my doorstep.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
People I didn't even
know cared about me--

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:84%
were showing up with presents
and things like that.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:90%
I had surgery.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And they removed many
of my lymph nodes

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:84%
as well as part of my
tongue, and my tonsils,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.630 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.287 align:middle line:84%
And then I had
radiation for six weeks.

00:03:54.287 --> 00:03:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And the effects of the
radiation were that I

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.950 align:middle line:90%
couldn't eat for three months.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And I really quickly
began to lose weight.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And I lost 70 pounds
in three months

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.109 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much
became a skeleton

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
from being kind of a larger
woman, to being a skeleton.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.233 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sit down.

00:04:12.233 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I just was all bones.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
what happened for me

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:84%
is I got to start
recreating myself from bones

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:90%
up, emotionally and physically.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.529 align:middle line:90%
And it really changed who I am.

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm a
totally different person.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.361 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I look different.

00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:90%
I sound different.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:90%
I act different.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything is different for me.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And I feel at this
point like it's

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:90%
a gift that was given to me.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the first
thing is that I

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:84%
started to learn
even while I was sick

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that there was really no
reason not to take risky things

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:90%
and do them.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I think because I
almost lost my life,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly realized
how precious it was.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I lived
in this town for 13 years.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.350 align:middle line:84%
At the time I was diagnosed,
I was in a really--

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:90%
not a very happy relationship.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:90%
I quit my job.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:90%
I ended the relationship.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:90%
I moved into my own place.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
A year later, here I am at
Omega after the breaking up

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:84%
with the relationship
and just getting healthy.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like the sky is
the limit at this point.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've moved out
of my town of 13 years.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.307 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea where
I'm going after this.

00:05:46.307 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's really because of that.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized
through the experience

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that the safety of society
wasn't really going to cut it.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was sick.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:90%
I was pretty much dying.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And anything I'd
done up to that point

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:90%
really wasn't that ecstatic.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I'm
kind of on the path

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:90%
to bliss at this point.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm a really
skeptical spiritual person.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm not into the fufu stuff.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
But I really feel as though
I'm ready to explore it.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:84%
I remember at one
point when I hadn't

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:90%
eaten for a really long time.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was so hungry and
so weak and realized

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that was probably the hungriest
I would ever be in my life.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to just
experience it, instead of

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:90%
crave pizza or anything.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that was a
really profound moment for me.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I could
handle almost anything.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.980 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:13.935 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like I can.

00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's funny.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.128 align:middle line:84%
My voice is a really
big indicator.

00:07:19.128 --> 00:07:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I'm feeling sad or
afraid, it disappears still.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a blessing.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just having like a
little meter to tell me

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:84%
when I'm not really being true
to myself and that's good news.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.530 align:middle line:90%
That's good news.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like now
I really learned

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.930 align:middle line:84%
to use my voice not
only for myself,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
but to weave everybody's
conflicts out.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:84%
In the last couple years,
I've been told a lot of times

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
that I'm a really great
conflict resolver.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.089 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
because I've finally

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:54.255 align:middle line:90%
learned how to use my voice.

00:07:54.255 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of a high voice.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And now I-- my uncle
calls it a whiskey voice.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.950 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's definitely
a lower, gruff voice.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that's
one of the few things

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that I'm most upset
about around it

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.900 align:middle line:84%
is that I miss my old singing
voice and just the ability

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:90%
to speak loudly and all that.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
But I guess it's kind of a small
price to pay at this point.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:84%
What I learned is
that because I had

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.740 align:middle line:84%
went through basically dying and
being reborn, that as a result,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I can hold the space for
anyone going through anything.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.510 align:middle line:84%
In the last few
years, it just so

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
happened that a
lot of people going

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:84%
through really difficult things
have wound up in my life.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I've
midwifed them through it.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.016 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
because of my experience

00:08:49.016 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:90%
that I was able to do that.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.806 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I ever
would have believed

00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that I would have the ability to
care for people in those places

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:90%
before this.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.860 align:middle line:90%
It's what fires me up now.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's my joy now.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I think then I was just so
ignorant of my own preciousness

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:90%
in life, just that--

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.025 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every part of me-- my
communication, my sexuality,

00:09:26.025 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:90%
my friends--

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I didn't
really care for myself.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:90%
And now, I feel so precious.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And every moment feels
that way to me now.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I cry so often not
because I'm sad,

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:47.397 align:middle line:84%
but because I feel so blessed
to be living this life.

00:09:47.397 --> 00:09:50.820 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, my name has
two pronunciations.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.880 align:middle line:84%
One is Yzaye and
the other is Ysaye.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm named Ysaye
by my father, who

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:84%
was a violinist, and who named
me after the violinist Eugene

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Ysaye who was from Belgium.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:84%
My father gave me
that name because he

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
wanted me to be a violinist,
and he taught me for 17 years.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But really, that was
my father's dream.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know I was
supposed to be a musician,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:84%
so I tried many other
things in my life.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.250 align:middle line:84%
When I was 12 years old,
I met a girl from Haiti,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:90%
and she was deaf.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And in that same year, I went
to see a Broadway play called

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:90%
"The Miracle Worker."

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.650 align:middle line:84%
It was about Helen Keller,
who was both deaf and blind,

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and her teacher who
taught her how to speak.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And she became a very, very
famous woman, very capable

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:84%
of doing anything
that she wanted to do.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And I decided at
the age of 12 that I

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be a miracle
worker, that I wanted

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:90%
to teach deaf kids how to talk.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend who
I could start with.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And we got to know each
other very, very well.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And when it was time
for me to go to college,

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I decided not to major
in music, but to go

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.310 align:middle line:84%
into speech pathology,
so I could learn how

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:90%
to teach deaf kids how to talk.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly enough, I never
worked with a single deaf person

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:84%
all through my training--
bachelor's, master's, and PhD

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:90%
in speech pathology.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided
that I would go

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
to Gallaudet University
in Washington, DC

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.270 align:middle line:84%
to study sign language
so that at least I

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.660 align:middle line:84%
could begin to communicate
with people who were deaf

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.400 align:middle line:84%
or who were part of
the deaf community.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I
studied interpreting

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
so that I could actually
be in situations where

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I was the link between
the deaf and the hearing.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And one Sunday I was asked
to actually interpret

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.120 align:middle line:84%
a church service that
had to do with people

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:84%
with various
handicapping conditions.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And someone said, well,
could you also sing?

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And I decided,
well, maybe I could,

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that I could interpret the
service into sign language,

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and that I could sing at some
point and sign for myself.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It happened that during
that church service,

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Bernice Reagon, who was
the founder of Sweet

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Honey in the Rock,
came to that service.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.010 align:middle line:84%
She had never come to a
service at that church before,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:90%
but she came to this service.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:90%
She heard me singing.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:90%
She saw me signing.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.044 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards she
came up to me and said,

00:12:50.044 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm a member of Sweet
Honey in the Rock,

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking
for a new member.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to join?

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Or would you like to
come and audition?

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, me?

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:15.745 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) I sing because
I'm happy and I sing.

00:13:15.745 --> 00:13:18.680 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I was teaching
in a dental school.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I was being a
speech pathologist.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:90%
I was doing health things.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:26.330 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And it never
occurred to me that I

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:84%
could join a group
that was establishing

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:84%
the kind of reputation
that it was,

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that had a sense of mission
and purpose whose music--

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Bernice's music, at least,
I had been listening to

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Because she was a member of the
SNCC Freedom Singers who I had

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.100 align:middle line:84%
listened to through
college in the '60s.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:90%
But I agreed.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was very, very glad
that on this occasion,

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I had said yes.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And that really,
I think, is kind

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:84%
of the moral of the story is to
say yes when the time is right.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Because when I said
yes, I opened a door

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that I had no idea
even existed--

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.070 align:middle line:84%
a world of music
that I thought I

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.890 align:middle line:84%
had turned my back
on at the age of 17

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:90%
when I left to go to college.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And since joining Sweet
Honey in the Rock,

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.860 align:middle line:84%
literally things have
happened that I could never

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:90%
have planned.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the lessons
I've learned through my life

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.160 align:middle line:84%
is that even though we may
have our own personal goals,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be a much
bigger plan at work,

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and that sometimes by simply
saying yes to small steps,

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.445 align:middle line:84%
we're actually saying yes
to a much bigger picture.

00:14:56.445 --> 00:14:59.384 align:middle line:90%
And so for the past--

00:14:59.384 --> 00:15:00.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how many years.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:90%
My math isn't good.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But since 1979,
I've been singing

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
with Sweet Honey in the
Rock, which has given me

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to travel
throughout the world, which

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have done as
a university professor.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:84%
It has given me the opportunity
to begin to write music

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and to have that music performed
by artists and by choirs

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:90%
around the world, really.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:84%
It has given me the
opportunity to deepen

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:84%
my knowledge of African and
African-American history

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and culture in a way
that has been meaningful

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:84%
for my own spiritual,
political health

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and has helped me to begin
to do these workshops,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.310 align:middle line:84%
like the one that I'm doing
now at Omega Institute, where

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:84%
people come to sing
and come to participate

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
in an experience of building
community through song

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and through a
common understanding

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:84%
of the history that has actually
brought these songs into being.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:13.690 align:middle line:84%
What I recognized ultimately
is that my personal goal

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:18.490 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to give voice
to the deaf in some ways

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:22.720 align:middle line:84%
has come to fruition,
through this enabling people

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
to sing and to
find their voices.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So that not literally am I
working with deaf people,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
but I am very literally working
with people whose voices I

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:90%
am helping to unfold.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:84%
My father and his
dream are not lost,

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:84%
because everything
that I am doing now I

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:84%
learned before I
was 17 years old.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) I'm happy and
I sing because I'm free.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the
music, the skills that I

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
have as a musician,
all of those things

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I learned studying the violin,
studying music in high school.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:90%
And so nothing is lost.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:90%
In fact, everything matters.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.819 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I've
ever done in my life

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:84%
has contributed to the moment
that I am in right now.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.015 align:middle line:90%
That essentially is my story.

00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:44.182 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.182 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm an actress and
a singer from New York.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't been
very successful at it.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of
getting discouraged back

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:90%
around 10 years ago or so.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.690 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't getting much work.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I was just getting extra
work here and there.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was getting kind
of hard to keep it up,

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:84%
also living hand to mouth
doing temp work here and there.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:90%
And I hated being poor.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same time,
my mom became very ill.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:90%
She became an invalid.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, that threw
my perspective way off.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:84%
The idea of standing in
front of a casting director,

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:84%
pouring out my heart and
soul and having him say next,

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:84%
suddenly didn't seem
so important to me

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
when my mother was lying
gravely ill in a hospital.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So I put performing on the
back burner for a while.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And I figured I would get
back to it eventually.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And I took a permanent
job in a law firm,

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:84%
which is the furthest thing
from being a performer that

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:90%
can possibly be.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.706 align:middle line:90%
But it earned me money.

00:18:54.706 --> 00:18:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm going
to get back to it someday.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
back to it someday.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And years went by, and I
wasn't getting back to it.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.405 align:middle line:84%
And then 1998-- my
mother passed away.

00:19:07.405 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you suffer a loss
like that and something's

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:84%
missing from your
life, or something

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:84%
was missing from
my life, I suddenly

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.340 align:middle line:84%
realized what else was
missing from my life as well.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Not only did I not have my mom
anymore, but I started looking.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, Susan, come on.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's be honest.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
What else is missing
from your life?

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.927 align:middle line:84%
And I knew, of course,
it was performing.

00:19:31.927 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that I
didn't want to do it

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:90%
the same way I did it before.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I didn't
want to go back

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.970 align:middle line:84%
to being the starving actress
and living hand to mouth.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't know what my
first step was going to be.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And my wonderful
sister-in-law introduced me

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.360 align:middle line:84%
to the Omega institute, and
she said this is what you need.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.324 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.324 --> 00:19:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I came here and
I did a course called

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Life Shaping, which was
basically trying to tell you,

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, you can change your life.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:84%
You can shape your
life, but don't expect

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:90%
to have all your bases covered.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Don't expect to know what
step two is going to be.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.005 align:middle line:84%
Just take step one and
trust that step two

00:20:09.005 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:84%
is going to come along,
which was very scary to me.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I had always
tried to, oh, well, what

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do next.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Next week I have this temp job,
and next week I have this one.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.969 align:middle line:84%
I was always used to
covering my bases.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of
scary to think, OK,

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to trust this.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:90%
So I came home.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And the first step I
did was I got in touch

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
with a voice teacher who
I had met once before.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:35.932 align:middle line:84%
And so I started singing
different songs with her.

00:20:35.932 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And I brought in a
Grossman song one day.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I remember Norma was
playing at her piano.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.381 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
she looked at me

00:20:41.381 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and she said, oh, Susan, this
is the music you've got to sing.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.110 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:90%
This is for you.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.177 align:middle line:84%
And we both, of course-- it
fit my voice like a glove.

00:20:52.177 --> 00:20:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I said this is the music that
I've heard mommy and daddy

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.565 align:middle line:90%
play all their lives.

00:20:55.565 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:84%
This is what I
really want to do.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) Da, da, da, da, da,
da, ba, da da da, da, da, da.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So I started working
on jazz standards.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was building
up a repertoire

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.116 align:middle line:84%
to the point of
doing my own set.

00:21:07.116 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Even though I didn't know
how I was going to do it,

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.030 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I wanted to
perform my own set someday.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So I kept on building
up a repertoire,

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and I had 10, 12
songs underneath me.

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And then through
my voice teacher,

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I got in touch with
this organization

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.710 align:middle line:90%
of musicians and performers.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.766 align:middle line:84%
And they also had
connections to certain clubs

00:21:25.766 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:90%
around New York City.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.490 align:middle line:90%
So, yay, I could perform.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And I started performing
in singer showcases

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:90%
with like 10 other singers.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle line:90%
And I would be--

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I'd get to do my three
and four-song set,

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:90%
and that was really cool.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But I said, now, I
want to do my own set

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.020 align:middle line:90%
for a whole entire hour.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So I found the best damn
musicians I could for my money.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:90%
They're all wonderful people.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.105 align:middle line:84%
We got together and
it was phenomenal.

00:21:51.105 --> 00:21:53.610 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) Da, da, da, da, da.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I kept on saying thank
you, thank you, thank you.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:90%
This is so great.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I threw my arms around my
accompanist, because I said,

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
how great this is,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:90%
how easy it was going to be.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And as much as I think
about my law firm job,

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I had to fill every
one of those seats,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%
because I had the
7:00 to 8:00 slot.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And albeit they might
aggravate the bejesus out of me

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.730 align:middle line:84%
during the day,
bless their hearts.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Every seat in the place was
taken by family and friends,

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.190 align:middle line:84%
but also by all those wonderful
people who work at my law firm.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:90%
And they cheered me on.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.488 align:middle line:84%
And, well, I could
have done two hours.

00:22:34.488 --> 00:22:35.850 align:middle line:90%
I did an hour--

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:37.140 align:middle line:90%
a little more than an hour.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
But since I got this
from the universe,

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:84%
since I was able to manifest
this hour-long thing,

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm putting it out there.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to be paid for
it, instead of me paying out.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.340 align:middle line:90%
So that's my story.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:90%
