And I do consulting work.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Part of my time is spent
doing strategic planning

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:90%
with non-profits.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And part of my time is spent
teaching mind body health.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of health
problems in my life,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:90%
starting from a girl.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And looking back
on that, I believe

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that that made me a seeker,
because I never really wanted

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
to accept that this was my
fate, or this was my life,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
to live other than being
very healthy and vital.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I started with endometriosis
as a teenager, which

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:90%
is a reproductive disease.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:84%
I have thyroid disease,
Sjogren's syndrome

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:84%
at one point, which is
an autoimmune disease.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Lots of joint aches
that were unexplainable.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that was maybe
part of the picture, too, was,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, gee, you
don't just have this,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:90%
but you have this and this.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of going
along, seeking, searching.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.190 align:middle line:84%
But really wasn't a
spiritual sort of search.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:90%
It was more from the outside in.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I was 40,
the endometriosis

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:84%
got so bad that I
realized that I really

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:90%
need to do something about it.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And the choice that most
medical science has for women

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:90%
is a hysterectomy.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
course I opted for.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I had that surgery, and
I was under the impression

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:90%
that that was a cure.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:90%
And so I had it and recovered.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't happy about
it, because I felt like I

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:90%
was losing part of myself.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So a year went by, close to
a year and a half went by,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and I started to feel the
same sort of pain and symptoms

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:84%
that I had prior to
the hysterectomy.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And my mind was saying,
well, that can't be,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:90%
because this was a cure.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:90%
So this must be something else.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
I did some testing and, you
know, back to the doctor

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:90%
I went.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know, sure
enough, it was back.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:84%
When that happened to
me, I was devastated.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Having been through
a surgery, you

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
know the pain, the suffering,
the disruption of your life.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was as low as I
ever have been in my life.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
there was no way out.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So you come face to face with
yourself, because there's no--

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing else.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So as I was leading up to the
days of the second surgery,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and just, you know, at a
point of complete suffering,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
that's all I can
really describe it as.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
other words for it.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:90%
I started to pray.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And I always had faith
and belief in God,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think
I ever, you know,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.250 align:middle line:84%
was kind of put to
the test, so to speak.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So really, what I was
praying for was peace

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:90%
from this suffering and fear.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:84%
The day before the surgery
came, and I woke up that day

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:90%
and I felt peaceful.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I felt an absence of the
fear and pain and suffering.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know,
my prayers were answered.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:90%
And I felt very grateful.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And it opened my
eyes to something

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:84%
that I had obviously missed,
which was relying on my faith.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:84%
We can say that we
believe, and we do.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:90%
And we mean it.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:84%
But saying it and practicing
it are two different things.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So I had to come into
another level of that faith

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and realize that I
could talk to God.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
God would listen and
answer my prayer.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And I had it demonstrated for
me, you know, very powerfully.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So that opened me
up to, you know,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:84%
well, gee, there's more
to this than I thought.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
I actually had a
relationship with God.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize that was
possible on that level before.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So went into the surgery,
came out the other side.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:90%
It was a long and slow recovery.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I was faced with
myself and my life.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And I really did open
to that opportunity.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I came
to the realization

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
was that a job that I
had been in for 18 years

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:90%
was really no longer serving me.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.024 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I
didn't want to go back.

00:05:48.024 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:84%
However, that was
a hard decision,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
because I knew a lot of
people wouldn't understand.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:90%
It was a good job.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.705 align:middle line:90%
I was earning good money.

00:05:54.705 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:90%
I had lots of friends.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, so how do
you explain that?

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So I started with my husband,
who was actually wonderful

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:90%
and understood.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I decided to go back to
work and train a replacement

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, in
essence, give my notice.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:90%
And so I did that.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And when I did
that, I had nothing

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.840 align:middle line:90%
to go to except back to myself.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So I continued sort
of to learn more

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
about this spiritual
sort of side of myself

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:90%
that had opened up.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
illness differently.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the whole
thing as, you know,

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
a mind, body, spirit
experience, rather than

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
a physical breakdown
of the body.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:90%
I started to meet teachers.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:84%
You know that saying of
when the student is ready,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.300 align:middle line:90%
the teacher will come?

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I would meet teachers
who would start

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
to put the pieces of this mind,
body, spirit sort of approach

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:90%
to health together for me.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I examined energy work and
how that related to wellness.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I started to meditate.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I started to use visualization
and guided imagery.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:84%
My relationship with God
has changed and grown

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:84%
because I have realized that
I'm more than my physical self.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So in doing that, I really
have opened my heart.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I've opened my
heart to compassion,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:90%
to love, and to service.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So I've followed a
very different path

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:90%
since I've had that opening.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I went through four jobs, just
in search of didn't know what.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But it kind of got to be
a joke with my friends

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.110 align:middle line:84%
after awhile like, oh,
what are you doing now?

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And I could only
imagine what they

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:90%
might have said behind my back.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.570 align:middle line:84%
But I really didn't
care anymore,

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
because what it was
all about for me

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:90%
was finding the truth of myself.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.460 align:middle line:90%
And that was my journey.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.876 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
was looking for.

00:08:08.876 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't matter
what anyone else thought.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So that led me to
really realizing

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:84%
that my passion was
mind body health.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I connected
with my passion,

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.170 align:middle line:84%
my life changed again
in a really great way.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I went to a professional
training program.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I learned more about
mind body health.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And I just realized
that, you know,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
from my own experience
in life, that I

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.360 align:middle line:84%
can help others to
understand where

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:84%
they might be at, especially
through disease and illness.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what I
really connect with.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:90%
And so I followed that path.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing
consulting work now.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm teaching people how
to perceive mind body

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
health in a different way
than they might have thought

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
they could, that they
can reduce their stress,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.720 align:middle line:84%
that they can cope with
life challenging illness

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
differently, more holistically,
you know, more centered,

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle line:90%
more with spirit.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.864 align:middle line:84%
And it's been really
rewarding and fulfilling.

00:09:16.864 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>> For my story, I was a
professional runner and had

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:84%
ripped my Achilles tendon
and was surgically repaired.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And during my blood
work, the doctors

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:84%
found that my adrenals,
kidney, and livers were not

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:90%
functioning.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And my story is
dramatic but very true.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:84%
I had been told that
I had six months

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:84%
to live, along with the fact
that my Achilles tendon was

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:90%
never going to be proper again.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.820 align:middle line:84%
In terms of that, I would
be limping most my life

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:90%
and had loss of range of motion.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:90%


00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And really, I was at the pit
or the bottom of my life,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.790 align:middle line:84%
having been told
that I was going

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:90%
to die because of my blood.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.610 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:90%
And I began to practice.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And within a week, my
Achilles tendon, or my foot

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.590 align:middle line:84%
rather, regained its
motion, its dorsiflexion.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And then through the yogic
practice and a yogic diet,

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:90%
my blood came back to normal.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I had blood work
done two years later,

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.930 align:middle line:84%
sent the results back to my
orthopedic surgeon in Texas,

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and he was convinced
it was a miracle.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, the miracle was
the yogic practice.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.428 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] face up.

00:10:46.428 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Jump up [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.090 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.455 align:middle line:90%
Then take your breathing.

00:10:50.455 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Now one.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I came to yoga for
physical reasons.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I was becoming a Catholic
priest as a youngster

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:90%
and was at seminary program.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Because of the doctrines of
what was happening at the time,

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:90%
I left the church.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really leave
my spirit, but I

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:84%
left the church, which to me
at the time was spirituality.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.005 align:middle line:90%
Breathe now one.

00:11:10.005 --> 00:11:12.870 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:84%
I came to yoga looking
for physical help.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But what I really found,
I came home to my spirit.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.210 align:middle line:90%
I came home to my heart.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a classic example
of somebody coming in,

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:84%
thinking for physical reasons,
but then really finding

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
my spirit and my
spiritual path again.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:47.764 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.764 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a mom.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And the soul story that
I would like to tell

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.995 align:middle line:90%
is about my son, Joshua.

00:11:55.995 --> 00:11:58.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
When I was pregnant,
I had an experience

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:90%
that was pretty amazing.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I was in labor for
24 and 1/2 hours.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:90%
I was in a lot of pain.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know any better.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I'd never had a baby.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:90%
And it hurt.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So after he was born, I was
told that three days later I

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.960 align:middle line:90%
should be back to normal.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, I wasn't.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't walk.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I walked like an old
person, bent over.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't straighten my legs.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So my husband drove
me to the hospital.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.470 align:middle line:90%
It was scary.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
was wrong with me.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I went in for
exploratory surgery.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:84%
It had turned out
that my appendix

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.535 align:middle line:90%
had ruptured and burst.

00:12:54.535 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Peritonitis had set in.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
They drained a pint
of fluid from my body.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.890 align:middle line:90%
I was in medical journals.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:90%
I nearly died.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
time I woke up,

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:84%
a nurse was pumping my breasts
to keep the milk flowing.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to ask
her what condition

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I was in, but all that came
out of my mouth was water.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like my brain and my
other brain wasn't working.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So I closed my
eyes, and I asked,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I guess God, or myself,
what would happen if I died.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Because I knew that I was--

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:90%
I knew that I could go.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:90%
I knew that.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.010 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought of my husband.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:90%
And his name is Spencer.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that Spencer would
be OK, that he would be in pain,

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:84%
but he would go on with this
life and he would be fine.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And then-- now keep in mind, my
son was newborn, a week old--

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.215 align:middle line:84%
I saw my son in an
oval picture frame.

00:14:26.215 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And the picture I saw was
him when he was three.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Literally, he was three.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
mommy, don't go.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.440 align:middle line:90%
And so I didn't go.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:15:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And so what that did for
me is that I was so sick,

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and in so much pain, that I
learned a couple of things.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:84%
One is that it is
absolutely amazing

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:84%
how much pain a human body
can withstand and survive.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And two, death isn't
something to be feared.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I learned.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.060 align:middle line:90%
And I'll never forget it.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:39.750 align:middle line:90%
This is Josh.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:90%
This is after my operation.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.350 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:84%
That's after my second
son was born, just after.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.311 align:middle line:84%
That's what he looked
like when I saw him.

00:15:53.311 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:90%
He was a little younger.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.926 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.926 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's about what
he looks like now,

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
except he's got long hippy
hair, like this, which is great.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:84%
I guess the way it affects me
today is I have a joy for life.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I have an appreciation
for nature and children.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Any child is a gift.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.390 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Nature is a gift.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Being alive is a gift.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it's OK when
I hear of people dying.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:59.130 align:middle line:84%
It's OK that they die, because
it's what's supposed to happen.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.450 align:middle line:90%
It's part of life.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:08.889 align:middle line:84%
So it just helps me be more
centered and more trusting.

00:17:08.889 --> 00:17:11.932 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.932 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it does.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:26.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm from Belgium, and this is
my story how I changed my life.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.200 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.060 align:middle line:84%
I used to be a very much
career oriented person.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:42.830 align:middle line:84%
For 20 years that was the most
important part of my life,

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
together with having a
nice house, and a nice car,

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and a good job, and all the
money and all the things

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.760 align:middle line:90%
that come along.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And I had decided to do what
it took to achieve that.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:18:00.270 align:middle line:84%
So little by little, I
taught myself in many fields.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate to be
prolific in languages.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And I taught myself
to type and to work

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:90%
on a computer and all that.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So after a few years, I
became a very highly paid

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:90%
executive assistant.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And for a while,
I even enjoyed it.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.830 align:middle line:84%
But after some
time, I really was

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:22.070 align:middle line:84%
wondering what the point was,
and why I wasn't feeling happy,

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and why I wasn't
fulfilled, and why I still

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:84%
had this feeling of emptiness
and of yearning, really.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And a few years ago, I started
to feel very weak and very ill.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And I found out I had
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning I wasn't
too worried, because I thought,

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:84%
you know, it will just go
away and I'll get better.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't get better.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And I tried several
therapies, homeopathy

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:90%
and other alternative therapies.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.380 align:middle line:90%
I became a vegetarian.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, I found that my
energy level was continuously

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:58.920 align:middle line:90%
going down.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that that was really
leading to the end of my life,

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.590 align:middle line:90%
prematurely.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:90%
And I was really desperate.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And one day, my homeopath doctor
advised me to try acupuncture.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And he sent me to a woman
doctor who was really

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:90%
applying light therapy.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And while she checked me out,
as is the regular practice,

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.490 align:middle line:84%
she told me that my
energy was really so

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:84%
low she couldn't really even use
the needles for the acupuncture

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
therapy, because that
would take away more energy

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:90%
than it would give me.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
But little by little, the
light therapy helped me.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And I began to feel that I
became a little bit stronger

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:84%
again, although I had to return
for treatment once a week.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, twice a week, three
times a week, once a month.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And I started wondering
what I did wrong,

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
why I had to go and
get this treatment,

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and why I wasn't able to build
up my energy myself and feel

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
healthy and energetic
and to enjoy my life.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So I talked about
it with her, and she

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.430 align:middle line:90%
advised me to try Tai Chi.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
revelation for me.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.550 align:middle line:84%
It showed me that I could
access my own natural energy,

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:90%
the cosmic energy.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And it also gave me this
feeling that I was really alive,

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:27.180 align:middle line:84%
that this very vibrant life was
inside me, and it was moving,

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:90%
and I could experience it.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.949 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
wonderful experiment.

00:20:30.949 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was a wonderful feeling.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.550 align:middle line:90%
I was extremely grateful for it.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:84%
After having done Tai
Chi for some time,

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to
classes in body work.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And I started to do
a little bit of that.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It was related,
somewhat, to Shiatsu,

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.100 align:middle line:84%
but I felt it was a little
bit too physical for me.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But it still taught
me a few things

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:90%
about what happens in the body.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And so it was still
very interesting.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.210 align:middle line:84%
But little by little, and
after several teachers,

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I felt that it was
not for me just

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
to copy what the other
people were doing.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And I started to look
for my own thing,

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:84%
to find out what
was right for me.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And I began to feel more
confident that I could really

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.000 align:middle line:84%
do my own meditation, that I
could do my own energy work.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And little by little,
people came to me

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:90%
and asked me to help them.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
started healing.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not a physical
way of healing.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:84%
It's very much working into
the aura around the chakras.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I use my hands and the way
that I feel in my hands

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and in my own body what's
happening for the person

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:90%
and what they need.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So I really want,
now, to pursue this

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:90%
and to continue in this field.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And I really am grateful
for the things that

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
happened to me, although
it seemed in the beginning

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that it was going in
a very bad direction.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Becoming sick and
a whole process

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:08.010 align:middle line:84%
of changing the focus of my
life to more spiritual matters,

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.040 align:middle line:84%
the first step was
really to work part time.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you
know, that that

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:84%
would allow me to
live the balance

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:21.060 align:middle line:84%
between the spiritual part of
life and the material needs.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:84%
But I feel now that's not
really working, because you

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:90%
need to shift all the time.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's really very disturbing.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that was 3
and 1/2 years ago.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And now I recently decided
to stop work altogether

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and to really explore
my own way and how I

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:90%
can be of help to other people.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.110 align:middle line:84%
I also found out
if you are happy,

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:84%
if you're peaceful, if
you're not judgemental,

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
this is like a
contagion around you.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's sometimes
really funny to see,

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:84%
but very often
it's just a grace.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very grateful for that.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.930 align:middle line:90%
