>> I'm 39 years old.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm from Montreal, Canada,
where I was born and brought up.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I had good marks in school and
generally had a very average

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'd say a
stimulating upbringing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:84%
By the time I got into college
age, I started to lose focus.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And I started to lose interest
in studying hard and in reading

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:90%
and in going to school on time.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I dropped out of
college, actually, just

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:84%
after a few months and moved
out of my parents' house

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
at the young age of 17 and moved
into a large flat in downtown

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Montreal, which was shared
by a group of musicians.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And we had constant
use of drugs,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:90%
alcohol, just 24-hour partying.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:84%
After that, it
was a real stumble

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:84%
for a few years caused
by my lack of focus,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:84%
my continued use of drugs
and abuse of alcohol.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I went from job to
job very quickly.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:84%
From the time I was 17
until I was about 22 or 23,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I probably had upwards of 50
or 75 jobs in various cities

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:90%
and towns all across Canada.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.382 align:middle line:90%
Basically I would take a job.

00:02:17.382 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't like it after
a few hours, I would leave.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I really had
absolutely no focus.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And whereas I
always had the dream

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and I knew I had the ability
to make a lot of money

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and to be a rich
guy, I obviously

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:84%
didn't apply myself to any
pursuit that would provide me

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:84%
with the stability to really
provide value to anybody

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:90%
else so that they would--

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:84%
so that the money
would come to me.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened was that
by the time I got into my 30s,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
of course, you're not as
young and fresh and vibrant.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And hangovers seemed to
last a little bit longer.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:84%
You get a little bit
more accustomed to always

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.320 align:middle line:90%
being stoned.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
stoned for a day or two,

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:84%
you wonder, where
can I get some pot?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Where can I get at least a
case of beer or something?

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Eventually what happened, I
was living in a print shop that

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:90%
belonged to a friend of mine.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:90%
On a couch is where I slept.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't really hardly
any money to pay rent.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I would help him out with
his jobs a little bit.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Until one day even my print
friend, who was another drug

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.394 align:middle line:84%
addict, finally just had enough
of me staying in his shop

00:03:30.394 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:90%
and told me I was on my own.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:84%
When I realized that I had
really nowhere else to turn,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I sat in a chair
in this print shop

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and listened to my
friend disown me,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.970 align:middle line:84%
who was really my last means of
support outside of my family.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I had to
change the way I lived

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and that if I continued
the way I was going,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:90%
I was going to wind up homeless.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:90%


00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
exact moment sitting

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.590 align:middle line:84%
in that chair with a feeling in
the pit of my stomach of fear

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that the only way was for
me to quit doing the dope

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and to get onto
a spiritual path.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And it took everything
I had, but I moved back

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.595 align:middle line:84%
in to my parents'
house at the age of 33.

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.690 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I did was I
attended Cocaine Anonymous

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.310 align:middle line:84%
meetings, Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings every day

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:84%
for at least six
to eight months.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I went to a meeting,
and I didn't smoke

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:90%
another joint for nine months.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:90%
It hit me hard.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.445 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't hit
me hard enough,

00:04:47.445 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
because after nine
months, I started smoking.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, you know what?

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:90%
I can handle it now.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.322 align:middle line:90%
I'll smoke one joint.

00:04:52.322 --> 00:04:54.530 align:middle line:84%
A month later I smoked
another joint, two weeks later

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.238 align:middle line:84%
another joint, a week
later, a day later,

00:04:56.238 --> 00:04:59.990 align:middle line:84%
until it became an
everyday habit again.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:84%
What the problem was and what
happens to so many people

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:90%
is I had not hit rock bottom.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.070 align:middle line:84%
It took me another six
months of using drugs

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
to finally sink low enough to
hit my personal rock bottom.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But it was really just
swallowing all my pride.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I feel that from
that point is when

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I left my adolescence behind
and started to really think

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.910 align:middle line:90%
about life more seriously.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I started taking the steps
required in order to live

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:90%
a successful, effective life.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:84%
After just a little
bit of sobriety,

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:90%
I gained back a lot of strength.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.444 align:middle line:90%
I got my youth back.

00:06:03.444 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of bills to pay.

I had about $30,000 of bills
to pay the day I got sober,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.864 align:middle line:84%

of absolutely zero.

job in the US in my business.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:84%

could use you in Canada.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:90%
So I gave them a call.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if you're ever
in New York, give us a call.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.176 align:middle line:84%

car, I drove to New York City.

put on a suit.

uplifting experience

to be able to look into the
eyes of a New York businessman

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and tell him that I
can deliver Canada.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:84%
I could speak with
conviction and sincerity.

The biggest lesson
that I've learned

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:84%
is that conscious
living is going

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
to allow a man to
walk with his head

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:84%
high without looking
over his shoulder

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that he's
doing what's best.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:17.590 align:middle line:84%

that will see us through

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.100 align:middle line:90%
so big she couldn't balance.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.990 align:middle line:84%
She had difficulty
balancing her body,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and she was afraid she
would slip on the ice.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:84%
She had varicose veins
that made it difficult

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:90%
for her to walk and stand.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
seeing her hide food

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:90%
in drawers and in the hamper.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And I learned from
her how to deal

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.470 align:middle line:84%
or attempt to deal and cope
with feelings by using food

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:90%
as a drug.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:84%
When I was 27 years
old, my mother was 62,

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and she retired from
work and got cancer.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And she was dead within
a year and a half.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:90%
They called the disease cancer.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I called it
compulsive overeating.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:90%
She was a grossly obese woman.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
She had no skills
for coping with life.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the combination
of growing up and watching

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:41.510 align:middle line:84%
her struggle and never learning
how to love or accept herself

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and then seeing her die was
tremendous motivation for me

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:90%
to overcome this problem.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I was really determined to
find a way out for myself.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.160 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I went to all different
major corporations,

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, Weight Watchers and
Think Thin and Way of Life

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and just tried every
kind of diet program

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:90%
imaginable out there.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't the answer.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced
to a program called

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Overeaters Anonymous,
where I learned that this

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.990 align:middle line:90%
was a threefold illness--

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, emotional,
and physical.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's where my
path began on the road

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
to heal physically,
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Emotionally I had to
learn and am still working

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:90%
on loving and accepting myself.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.330 align:middle line:84%
The emotional
recovery took being

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:84%
able to look at and be with all
of the emotions, the dark side

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:84%
of me, the shadow self, as
one famous therapist calls it.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I had to be able to look
at and be with myself

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:07.130 align:middle line:84%
when I felt jealous,
when I felt angry,

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:84%
when I was judgmental
of other people.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And I had to be able to
stay present with that

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and ride those feelings
and not turn to food

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to bury them as I
had my whole life.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It took some courage and
willpower in that way.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And I found that prayer
was and continues

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:90%
to be an essential tool for me.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I learned that prayer was
an extremely powerful tool.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I had a difficult time
with it for many years.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:13:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I thought of God or the higher
power as a punishing force.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I sort of transferred my
experience with my dad

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:84%
into this concept
of a higher power.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't imagine
some force that

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
was compassionate
beyond comprehension,

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.490 align:middle line:84%
that was loving beyond
comprehension, that

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.990 align:middle line:84%
was merciful beyond
my comprehension,

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:84%
because I never had
that experience.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:10%
I've used
visualizations as well.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.410 align:middle line:84%
I found that after several
years of attempting

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
to visualize my body the
way I wanted it to be,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't able to do it.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Every time I saw myself thin,
tremendous fear came up for me.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:90%
I saw myself sick and dying.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I saw myself get thinner
and thinner and thinner.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I connected that with
watching my mother die,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
going from a close to 300
pound woman to 78 pounds

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:90%
when she died of cancer.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm extremely
grateful for the freedom

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that I have around food, for
the freedom I have to experience

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:84%
a level of sadness and a
level of joy that was never

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:90%
available to me before.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.535 align:middle line:84%
I can dance like
nobody's watching.

00:14:31.535 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I can sing sometimes
like nobody's listening.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And I also have
many more moments

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.680 align:middle line:84%
which I'm extremely
grateful for,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.570 align:middle line:84%
where I can look at how
I can be of service, what

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I can contribute, whether
it's picking up a napkin

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
for a woman who's
dropped it on the floor

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.080 align:middle line:90%
and has difficulty bending.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, I'm not
so caught up in my head

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.770 align:middle line:90%
as I was for so many years.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Like the prayer says, it is
in giving that we receive.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And it is in dying
to the false self

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and the illusions
of our perceptions

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.900 align:middle line:90%
that we're born again.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And I have many moments and
days by the grace of God

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.937 align:middle line:90%
where I feel born again.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:41.206 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm 26 years old, and I
currently work at the Omega

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Institute for Holistic Studies.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I've been here since
April, and I'd just

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:90%
like to tell you my soul story.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Portland, Oregon.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I ended up getting in
a lot of trouble going

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:84%
through grade school,
got in a lot of fights,

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:90%
was always in trouble.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
After grade school,
I kind of started

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:84%
hanging out with you might
say the wrong kind of people.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I started doing a lot of
drugs, selling a lot of drugs.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I was in a gang, just kind of
went around and hurt people,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.760 align:middle line:84%
stole from people, basically
did things that were definitely

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:90%
not good will to man.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:10%
So I got into high school,
I started progressing,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:10%
started stealing from
stores, stealing from people,

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.550 align:middle line:10%
stealing cars, basically
victimizing, just

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:10%
victimizing anybody or anything
that I could exploit or take

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.660 align:middle line:10%
advantage of.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:84%
It didn't really
matter, family friends.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really
discriminate as long

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:84%
as I could get sort
of what I wanted.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty one-track
tunnel vision.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It still progressed, got worse.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Ended up getting kicked out
of a Jesuit high school.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Transferred to a
Catholic high school

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and made it there
about three months.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Then I ended up at a
public school system,

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:84%
which was probably absolutely
the worst thing that could have

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:90%
happened to me at that time.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.500 align:middle line:90%
I ended up driving my car--

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I was on a lot of acid
and a lot of speed.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I really shouldn't have
been behind the wheel.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
I was on my way to Portland
to my friend's house

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.545 align:middle line:84%
because he had more drugs, and
I wanted to get some more drugs.

00:17:16.545 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
And my car broke down
on the side of the road.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of pulled it off
and sat there in my car.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.504 align:middle line:84%
I was so high and just out
of it and realized, Jesus,

00:17:28.504 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the side of the road.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.753 align:middle line:90%
I need to get out of here.

00:17:30.753 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:90%
There's cops gonna come.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I ended up running down I-5 in
Portland, kind of falling down

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:84%
this hill, ending up on the
sidewalk, like real out of it.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.609 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't remember
my phone number.

00:17:41.609 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't remember
my friend's number.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Didn't have any money.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much decided
I was either going

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:51.030 align:middle line:84%
to step out in the
middle of the street

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:90%
or I was going to help myself.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And I chose to help
myself, luckily.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Somehow got a hold
of a friend, who

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.430 align:middle line:90%
paid for me to take a cab home.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And I went to my mother's house
at about 6:00 in the morning

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
the next morning
and told her that I

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:84%
was just a complete, full-blown
addict, just told her

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.750 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the terrible
things that I'd been up to,

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.120 align:middle line:84%
lots of things that I
always held from my family.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And my family really didn't
have an accurate depiction of me

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Ended up going to a drug rehab
facility up in Washington.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Went through some serious
withdrawal, depression.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.840 align:middle line:90%
But I met a woman there.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:90%
And this woman was the most--

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:84%
still is the most amazing
woman I think I've ever met.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:84%
She was considerably
older than I was.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:90%
But we really connected.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.192 align:middle line:90%
We came from the same--

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.900 align:middle line:84%
we may not have come
from the same place,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:84%
but we ended up
at the same place.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And we both wanted
spirituality back in our life.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:84%
We both wanted to be able to
be in touch with ourselves

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and feel our lives
going on and not

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:84%
feel the pain that was in our
lives and the guilt of all

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:90%
the things that we had done.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up
having a connection.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And she went to a halfway
house for about three months.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And we talked every
single day on the phone.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And the day she got out,
I packed up my stuff,

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:90%
went up there.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:90%
We were together.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:84%
It was the best
experience I think I'd

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:90%
had at that point in my life.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
She kind of fell back into her
old behavior, you might say.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of fell
back into mine.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:10%
I still to this
day have not done

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:10%
speed in four years, no
acid, nothing like that.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But I still smoked
a little bit of pot.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Her drug of choice
was wine, was alcohol.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And as she began to drink, she
turned into a savage animal

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:84%
She was very verbally abusive,
very physically abusive.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:03.120 align:middle line:10%
And as her disease
progressed, her behavior

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.670 align:middle line:10%
started really getting
erratic, irrational.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:84%
She would hit me with
phones, plates, fists.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:90%
She bit me.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I had black eyes, bloody
noses, pretty much the worst

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:90%
scenario I could imagine.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And I never laid a hand on her.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of let her just
beat me down physically,

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.860 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, spiritually.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I realized that this
isn't what I wanted.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:90%
This isn't what I signed up for.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:84%
I was so low, low in my
life, that I couldn't even

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:90%
get up and leave the situation.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.720 align:middle line:90%
I came home one night.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:90%
She was just obliterated.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
She had probably had two
or three jugs of red wine.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And I made the biggest mistake
that I probably ever made,

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and I took her jug of
wine and poured it--

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:90%
just poured it down the sink.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
She flipped out like an animal,
just attacked me, punched me,

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:84%
kicked me, was spitting on me,
degrading me, victimizing me.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning I woke up
and saw my face and broke down,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:84%
had pretty much a
nervous breakdown

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and called my call
my boss, said I'm not

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.000 align:middle line:90%
coming into work anymore.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Called my landlord, said I'm not
paying on this house anymore.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:84%
I left my furniture,
left everything,

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.040 align:middle line:84%
came back to Portland,
and just pretty much died.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:90%
My life was my couch.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I would lay on my couch in the
deepest, darkest depression,

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:90%
crying and just pitying myself.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.032 align:middle line:84%
Realized that this
was what I was--

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:90%
I was owed this in a sense.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I spent most of my life
victimizing other people,

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle line:84%
hurting other people, and now
this was almost my penance,

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
was I had to endure pretty
much what I had dished out.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:10%
I knew I had to do
something drastic.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:90%
It had been about seven months.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't even approached a girl,
a woman, didn't trust anybody,

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:84%
didn't want anybody, never
went out with my friends ever.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:10%
My best friend, his father
used to be the director

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.180 align:middle line:10%
of operations here at Omega.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.070 align:middle line:84%
He told us all about
community, all about Omega,

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and all about how
spiritually uplifting it is.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I realized that was
someplace I needed to go.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I was completely
devoid of spirit,

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:90%
of any presence in my life.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was pretty
much a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:38.350 align:middle line:84%
If it suited me or
helped me, I would do it.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
But now I've been meditating a
lot and doing Kirtan chanting,

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:84%
trying to get into
Tai Chi, trying

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.050 align:middle line:84%
to do things that are going
to bring out my spirit and me.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And through the people
here and my family,

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I've really realized
that I'm not angry, mean,

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that I'm actually a warm,
compassionate, strong,

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:90%
confident man.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.835 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.835 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot
to offer people,

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.819 align:middle line:84%
and I have a lot
to offer myself.

00:23:10.819 --> 00:23:13.264 align:middle line:90%
