00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.290 align:middle line:84%
going through a Buddhist--
a 10-day insight meditation

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
retreat at that time, which
set me on my Buddhist path.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.383 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been in many ashrams
and monasteries and meditation

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.380 align:middle line:84%
retreats and pilgrimages
during that time

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:90%
in the first half of the '70s.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And I learned a little bit of
Tibetan, Hindi, and Nepali,

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I tried to buckle
down and learn Tibetan.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing-- learning
many meditation techniques

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:90%
and different--

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:84%
from different
teachers and practices,

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
which I did every day, and
I've been meditating every day

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
since then, since
1971, meditation

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.130 align:middle line:90%
being my main practice.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:84%
But somehow it wasn't really as
transformative as I expected.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I had some unreal
expectations about this,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:84%
feeling like that I would meet
a guru and get enlightened

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
or that after meditating for
a month in silent retreat,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:84%
doing nothing else, that I'd
get enlightened or find peace.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had said,
don't be too ambitious.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't expect too much.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a lifetime journey.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:12.102 align:middle line:84%
It takes many lifetimes
to enlightenment.

00:09:12.102 --> 00:09:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Then I met my root guru, as
we call in Tibetan, the Buddha

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Karmapa, Yawa Karmapa,
in Darjeeling,

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and followed him back to his
home monastery in Sikkim.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he is from Tibet, but
he had to leave Tibet in 1959

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.524 align:middle line:90%
before the Chinese invasion.

00:09:29.524 --> 00:09:33.040 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:84%
One day, the karmapa was giving
an empowerment initiation

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and introducing
the nature of mind,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:84%
as we call it in
Tibetan, a transmission,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.826 align:middle line:84%
introducing oneself to one's
true nature, Buddha nature.

00:09:48.826 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And he was sitting on his seat,
and there were just a few of us

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:84%
there, close disciples,
some tuchus and Tibet lamas

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and one or two Westerners
who lived there

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and who were somewhat
experienced, slightly advanced,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.950 align:middle line:90%
initiation empowerment.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked at my guru,
the karmapa, and our eyes

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
met, and he held up a crystal,
and suddenly, everything

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:90%
dissolved and was gone.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.680 align:middle line:90%
And he and I were totally one.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that his Buddha
mind and my original nature

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:90%
were absolutely one.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And myself and
him and the Buddha

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:84%
were absolutely and totally
one, since the beginning time

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:90%
in primordial truth.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if
everything he was and had

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
was pouring into
me, like standing

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:90%
in front of Niagara Falls.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.457 align:middle line:90%
And yet it was reciprocal.

00:10:51.457 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:90%
It was sort of in and out.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.250 align:middle line:90%
It was pouring in.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It was also pouring out of
me, as if he was looking out

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:90%
through my eyes.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if the Buddha was
pouring through him into me.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was really
a timeless moment

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
that lasted for quite
a while, perhaps half

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:90%
an hour or an hour.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:84%
But I was in that state
while he continued

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:84%
with the bell, the crystal,
and the other parts

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.020 align:middle line:84%
of the tantric ritual,
the introduction

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.854 align:middle line:90%
to the true nature of our mind.

00:11:20.854 --> 00:11:25.694 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:11:25.694 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, it was
as if he was me, and I was him.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I realized there
was nothing outside

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
to get, nothing more to
look for, nothing to find,

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.830 align:middle line:84%
nothing missing, that I was
perfect and complete just

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:90%
as I am.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.680 align:middle line:84%
The jewel in the
lotus, the light

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.180 align:middle line:84%
is found right here
in the darkness.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.475 align:middle line:90%
Shadows are nothing but light.

00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:84%
We can make friends with
ourselves, even the shadow

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.700 align:middle line:90%
and dark sides of our psyche.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And seeing the Buddha in him
and seeing the Buddha in me,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
seeing the Buddha in everyone
became reality for me.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.761 align:middle line:84%
And that totally
transformed my life.

00:12:04.761 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I say "see
the Buddha in others,"

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean the
Buddhist Buddha.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean the divine, the
light, seeing the Godhead

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:90%
in everyone and everything.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And that totally
transformed my life,

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and I've never been
the same since.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And I can't really
say how that happened.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.507 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the
practices that I did

00:12:25.507 --> 00:12:27.090 align:middle line:84%
must have had something
to do with it,

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.977 align:middle line:84%
but when the Karma
ripens, it's not

00:12:28.977 --> 00:12:30.810 align:middle line:84%
just a matter of what
you do or any strategy

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
you have in spiritual
practice and spiritual life.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.230 align:middle line:84%
There's also some kind
of karmic ripening

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:84%
or grace or kind of
luck, but yet practice

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:90%
makes us more lucky.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:90%
That I can promise you.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:10%
So I found that
this was, perhaps,

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:10%
the most transformative
experience in my life,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.900 align:middle line:10%
and I'll never forget that.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's as real
today as it was then.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.826 align:middle line:84%
I can see his eyes on
me and in me right now.

00:12:58.826 --> 00:13:03.263 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:03.263 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the part of my
life that I choose to speak

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:84%
of as my soul story, although I
would imagine there are really

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:90%
many points.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:84%
This is one that was really
seminal in my development.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And it takes me back
to my 20s when I was

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.900 align:middle line:90%
painting murals for a living.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was playing around with
Trompe-l'oeil images that would

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:90%
make walls disappear.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I would play with
the architecture that

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:84%
was in the building,
and then I would

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.260 align:middle line:84%
paint a landscape of
what was behind that wall

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:90%
as if the wall wasn't there.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And as I developed that, I
would work with landscapes

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.320 align:middle line:84%
more and more, and I
found myself backpacking,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:84%
taking trips out to the
wilderness by myself,

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.160 align:middle line:90%
longer and longer to do--

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:84%
to sketch, to do
studies of mountains,

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
before long, I

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:84%
realized I wanted to
live without walls.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.380 align:middle line:84%
My whole purpose in painting
the murals was to let people

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.420 align:middle line:84%
know, what is it like
if the wall isn't there,

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.430 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
wall in your mind

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:90%
or the wall in your living room?

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:90%
So I sold everything I had.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I bought a little, funky,
old Jeep, just kept

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:84%
what would fit in the Jeep, and
I moved out to the wilderness.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine had said I
could have five acres of land

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:84%
that he had way out on a
mountaintop, off the grid,

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:90%
away from any roads.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I took my Jeep, parked it
at the bottom of the mountain,

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.170 align:middle line:84%
because there were no roads
up the mountain at all,

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and took what I could
carry on my back

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:84%
up to the top of the mountain,
and lived two months alone

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:84%
in the wilderness above the
cloud line, above the tree--

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.200 align:middle line:84%
well, there were some
trees up there, but mostly

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:84%
above the tree line, and really
sat and watched the world.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And not only the
period of isolation,

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.760 align:middle line:84%
but the period of
removal from this culture

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that I was born and raised
in, like the rest of us,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:84%
gave me a different
kind of seeing.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.180 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the most
profound periods of my life.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
being young and free--

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.470 align:middle line:90%
I was not in a relationship.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:90%
I had no children yet.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I could just be by
myself with the elements.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And as I sat up on top of
the mountain in the morning,

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and I watched the air go by,
and sat by my fire each night,

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:84%
which was my light and my
company, sat by my fire

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and played my guitar
or wrote poetry,

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:84%
as I worked with
the rain catchers

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:84%
that I built, or had to just
conserve every drop of water,

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
because it was so
precious, and worked

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
with the lay of the land,
looking out at the landscape,

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:90%
at the trees, at the rocks.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I often think of
those pictures you

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.860 align:middle line:84%
used to see in the
malls, those 3D pictures,

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.350 align:middle line:84%
where it was nothing
but a surface pattern,

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
but if you looked
very deep into it,

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:84%
then you got to see another
pattern that would take shape.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the same way
once we remove ourselves

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:84%
from all the things we think
we need in this culture.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:90%
We begin to see differently.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.470 align:middle line:84%
A different picture
emerges that is normally

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.380 align:middle line:84%
obliterated by all
the sensation that's

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:84%
coming at us from signs and
noise and movies and radio,

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that when you remove
that for long enough,

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:90%
it's like your screen clears.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And it really was,
for me, a kind

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:33.580 align:middle line:84%
of revelation of the
perfect sanctity of nature.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And what got me down
off the mountain

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:84%
is that as I sat up there, and
I watched civilization coming up

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
the highways that I
could see from there

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and watched the
lights at night, I

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:84%
knew those lights in the
valley were going to grow.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I knew the highways
were going to grow,

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and that this experience
was not going to be

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:90%
taken by very many people.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I had to
come down off the mountain

00:16:54.750 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and help stop that nonsensical
expansion of culture

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:84%
into nature before we
lose it all, because we

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.560 align:middle line:90%
lose our perspective.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
important perspective--

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:90%
not just that nature has a plan.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Nature is the plan.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And we need to remove
ourselves from culture every so

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:84%
often in order to
listen to the music,

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:84%
in order to really
understand the language.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.310 align:middle line:84%
I have worked with the
chakra system, which

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:84%
is an ancient system from
the yoga tradition of India,

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:84%
since the mid '70s, when I
first discovered the word,

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.810 align:middle line:84%
and I work also as a
bio energetic therapist,

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:84%
so in private
sessions, I take people

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
through a process of
dissolving the body armor

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and moving energy
through the body.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.686 align:middle line:84%
Even clearing the space
behind your shoulder,

00:17:44.686 --> 00:17:46.550 align:middle line:90%
bringing your elbows back.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Ha.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:90%
With a breath, ha, ha.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
That two months on
the mountain, which

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.920 align:middle line:90%
was really my vision quest--

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:84%
that was the most profound
period of my life.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And that mountain will
always be dear to me.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It was called
Radical Ridge, and I

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.180 align:middle line:84%
think I have been a radical
ever since, if I wasn't before.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend, if we are
going to save this planet,

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:84%
we need to foray out
into nature and let

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.670 align:middle line:84%
go of the things of civilization
that we think are important,

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:84%
because on that mountain,
my college degree, my bank

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:25.650 align:middle line:84%
account, my accomplishments,
my portfolio of murals,

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:90%
they meant nothing.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:90%
They were worthless.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.850 align:middle line:90%
They had no value in that world.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that had value
was the muscles in my legs,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:40.680 align:middle line:84%
the strength of my back, my
mind to think, my eyes to see.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Only what I had with me and what
I could communicate with around

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:90%
me had value.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And that reset my
values, and that mountain

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.980 align:middle line:84%
will always be sacred
to me, as will nature.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.523 align:middle line:90%
And that's my soul story.

00:18:54.523 --> 00:18:59.453 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:59.453 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe my soul story
began with my own inner journey,

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.410 align:middle line:10%
my own personal journey.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:10%
About 10 years ago, I was having
some relationship problems,

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:22.540 align:middle line:10%
and I decided to
go to a therapist.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, I found
a very good one.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
start working on me

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what was
going on with me,

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and I grew tremendously
from that experience.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.730 align:middle line:10%
And from individual therapy,
I joined group therapy.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:45.970 align:middle line:10%
And that was really
significant in that I became--

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:10%
it was my first experience, I
think, at really being real.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.760 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd been working in
a corporation that

00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:84%
was very bottom line-oriented,
and I got paid very well,

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:90%
and I had all the perks.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And you think you've
just got it all,

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and over time, I
just came to realize

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.572 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't happy
with all of that,

00:20:08.572 --> 00:20:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and I really was looking
for more meaning in my life.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.030 align:middle line:90%
It became a real--

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that was really what
I wanted to find.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.535 align:middle line:84%
And I was having a lot
of trouble with my neck.

00:20:18.535 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was on the phone.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:90%
I was traveling.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.630 align:middle line:90%
I was always busy.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:84%
My head-- I was
always cluttered.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I would find myself working
all day and going home

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.917 align:middle line:84%
and not having any energy for my
social life, or for my friends,

00:20:30.917 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:90%
or for my boyfriend.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:32.916 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to become a hermit.

00:20:32.916 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And more and more,
as I grew, I felt

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I was growing away
from that career life.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.475 align:middle line:84%
I came to become
dissatisfied, and I

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:46.880 align:middle line:84%
was seeking for more
authenticity in my life.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I was very
inspired to need less.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.865 align:middle line:84%
That was sort of the answer was,
OK, you're always with media,

00:20:55.865 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and we're bombarded with ads,
and we've got to have this,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.365 align:middle line:90%
and we've got to have that.

00:20:59.365 --> 00:21:01.922 align:middle line:84%
And I really just
felt so comfortable

00:21:01.922 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:84%
trying to move away from
that, because I really

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.060 align:middle line:90%
saw the dead end street there.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I finally
said, you know, I've

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:16.510 align:middle line:84%
just got to find a way to
really resign and discover

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.450 align:middle line:84%
a way that I can
work on my own time

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and have more time to
do what I want to do.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And I really cut back on buy.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have-- I had
paid off all my debts

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and was really setting myself
up to do what I wanted to do.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:84%
It was actually my
12-year anniversary.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I walked in to my manager, and
I had my letter of resignation.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:90%
And I sat down.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:84%
I had tears in my
eyes, and I just

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:84%
let her know that it was
time for me to move on.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.890 align:middle line:84%
The truth of the
matter is the fear

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:84%
of not leaving became greater
than the fear of leaving.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And once-- it was almost like
an out-of-body experience.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It was like my soul had said,
in many ways, through my body

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:90%
and through my--

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:84%
just in my everyday thoughts
was communicating with me

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.110 align:middle line:84%
that there was more for me to
do and that I needed to move on.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Right now, one of my goals
is to really find my truth,

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.660 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like the inner
journey is the most fascinating

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:90%
journey that you can take.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot to
learn about oneself.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
There are just so many ways
I can grow, and I know that.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And the key is to figure
out what those are,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and then to be conscious so
that you can, every day, try

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.660 align:middle line:84%
to implement those ways that's
going to take you where you

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:84%
want to go, into
that peaceful realm

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:90%
that we all want to be in.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's not an overnight thing.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:42.400 align:middle line:90%
I was at the company for--

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I was really sort of
unhappy for five years.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.980 align:middle line:84%
If anyone understands that
paralyzing handcuffs of fear,

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:90%
I do, because I experienced it.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But I also know there's
another life beyond that fear.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And it just takes that
finally finding that courage

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.510 align:middle line:84%
to take those steps,
and anybody can do it.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do it.
