00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
have been an exceptional
journey for me.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:84%
It's been like being in the
front seat of a roller coaster

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:84%
at Canada's Wonderland,
you know, where I'm just,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
like, holding on for
my life to the bar.

you know, like, ah, ah, ah!

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:84%
It all started when I was on
a trip in Southern California.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:84%
On the winter solstice,
I was driving up

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
to a Tibetan monastery,
Karma Mahasiddha Ling,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.840 align:middle line:84%
high in the mountains
in Idyllwild,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:84%
which is in the high
desert above Palm Springs.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And I had the windows rolled
down in my Jeep Cherokee.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm singing, and
chanting, and praying.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
My religious practice
is Tibetan Buddhist,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:84%
so I was doing this Tibetan
chant to Holy Mother Tara, Om

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Tare Tuttare Ture Svaha.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:90%
I had a very happy mind.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I was going up to
morning prayers.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is this
very remote road

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:84%
that winds up about 14,000
feet from the desert floor.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:90%
And there's no guardrail.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And the road is along the
outside of the mountain.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And the monastery is right
at the top of the mountain.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm driving up-- it's,
like, 9 AM in the morning--

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
there's this woman standing
at the side of the road.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:90%
And I thought she looked cold.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
She had a cloth coat on,
a very thin cloth coat.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And I knew if I
stopped to pick her up,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd miss the morning
prayers, but something in me

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:90%
told me to pick her up.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:90%
So I picked her up.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, she was a
house keeper in the desert.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.550 align:middle line:84%
She had missed her last
bus up the mountain.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And her children had
stayed alone for the night.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And I felt very
troubled for her,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
so I made a point of bringing
her directly to her home.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And while we were
driving, she said to me,

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.780 align:middle line:90%
don't drive off the cliff today.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up in snow
storms in Northern Ontario.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I got my driver's
license in a snow storm.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And I've driven in icy
conditions, in whiteouts,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:90%
you know, for over 25 years.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, you know,
no, don't worry about me.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:90%
I'll be fine.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, like, and
this is the desert.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, what can
possibly happen?

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So I brought her to her
house and dropped her off.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:90%
And she peered in the window.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And again she said, don't
drive off the cliff today.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And she looked me
directly in the eyes.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:90%
And I said no, no, no, I'm fine.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:90%
You know, don't worry about it.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:90%
So I'm driving up.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.640 align:middle line:90%
I went around another corner.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And it started to snow,
because, of course,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving up through the
elevation very quickly.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And I had my shorts
and a top on.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:90%
It gets colder and colder.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:90%
I rolled up my windows.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:84%
The snow started hitting
the windshield furiously.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:90%
It turned to hail.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:90%
I went into four-wheel drive.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.715 align:middle line:90%
I'm being very careful.

00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I round a corner and the Jeep
goes out of control right out

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
from under me and starts rolling
over the side of the cliff.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
I'm going to die today.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, like, I'm on my
way to Tibetan prayers.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to die today.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I could think
of doing from my meditation

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:90%
practice was to call out--

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:84%
in Tibetan prayers, you
call it refuge, call

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
to the holy mother, Om Tare
Tuttare Ture Svaha, which,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
the translation from Sanskrit
is, Holy Mother, please

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.285 align:middle line:90%
come to my aid.

00:04:23.285 --> 00:04:26.790 align:middle line:84%
As I called that out, the
thought occurred to me,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, they're going
to telephone my mother

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and tell her that
I've died today.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt so much
grief in my heart and pain

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:84%
for my mother to get this
phone call, thinking,

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:90%
this would kill her.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And I just called out
to the Holy Mother

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.600 align:middle line:84%
again in Sanskrit, Om
Tare Tuttare Ture Svaha.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And my Jeep stopped
halfway down the mountain,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:90%
upside down on a stone.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.550 align:middle line:84%
A large boulder had
stopped the Jeep.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.560 align:middle line:90%
And I was pinned in it.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
The hood of the car
was ripped totally off.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.820 align:middle line:90%
The ceiling was caved in.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't undo the seat
belt. It was still in drive,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
but the car was
completely turned off.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.767 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
if I was paralyzed.

00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what had happened.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.980 align:middle line:90%
So I pinched myself.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel everything.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:90%
I felt OK.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.230 align:middle line:90%
And I was just so thankful.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So I managed to push myself up
somehow against the ceiling,

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and undo the seat belt,
and drop upside down.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And the hood of the car was
in a very precarious position.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So I managed to crawl
out of the broken glass

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and start crawling
up the mountain.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was some kind of
forest fire station up there.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And this man had seen
me go over the cliff

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:90%
in his rear-view mirror.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And he had a CB radio
or a cell phone,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:90%
and called for an ambulance.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:90%
And I was totally in shock.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:90%
So move fast forward to--

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.390 align:middle line:84%
I was, you know,
went to the hospital.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I broke several ribs
and fractured them,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:84%
injured my neck, my low back,
had glass shards in my arms,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:90%
my face, my legs.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:84%
I returned back to
Toronto, Canada.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was in terrible pain
and had a very difficult time

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:90%
healing from the broken ribs.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And the whole year of 1998,
I was in terrible suffering.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Roman
Catholic Church.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And I lit a candle
to the Virgin Mary.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And I prayed for some
kind of guidance.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Like, what is this about?

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Is my life as it was over?

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I had been very active as a
documentary filmmaker doing

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:90%
social justice issues.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was not able
to be a vital part

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.910 align:middle line:84%
of the community due to constant
physical and emotional pain.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling more and
more depressed and frustrated,

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.810 align:middle line:90%
like my life was over.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.900 align:middle line:84%
My religion that I was born
into was Roman Catholic.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And my religion of
choice as an adult

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.800 align:middle line:90%
has been Tibetan Buddhism.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So I lit a candle
to the Virgin Mary.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And I prayed very sincerely, you
know, what is this all about?

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.850 align:middle line:90%
Please show me.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:90%
And I had a dream that night.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, I saw
myself directing and producing

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
a live show of Rumi's poetry,
Mevlana Jelaluddin Rumi

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
is a Sufi poet from
the 13th Century.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was a little bit
familiar with his poetry.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I had a few of his
books, but he was not

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.110 align:middle line:90%
a moving force in my life.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So this dream kept
on nagging at me.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered what
it was really about.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
There were no other messages
that came to me at that time.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:90%
So I followed up.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And I called Coleman Barks, who
is one of the world's leading

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:90%
translators of Rumi.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, I'm this
crazy independent filmmaker

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:90%
from Toronto, Canada.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I tried to talk him
out of helping me out.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, I wanted
him to say, don't worry,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.460 align:middle line:84%
people have dreams like this all
the time, don't worry about it.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And he listened
to my whole story.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And then he said
to me, everybody's

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:90%
got to follow their dream.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And I started
crying on the phone.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I was being
called to do something.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't quite sure where
it was going to take me.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So fast forward to
October 23, 1999,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:84%
which was my 44th
birthday, my birthday

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.640 align:middle line:84%
present that year was to produce
and direct a live show of Rumi.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:90%
It was very successful.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I think we had 500 people on the
Friday night and the Saturday

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:90%
night.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And people were just
raised to ecstatic heights

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:84%
by the poetry of this
beautiful philosopher, Rumi.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
After that, I showed
some of the footage

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:84%
to a producer at
VisionTV in Canada.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And I received encouragement
from several people

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
to pursue a documentary
film about the work

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and the philosophy of Rumi
at work in the world today.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that,
during this process,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
the medical doctors couldn't
do anything with me.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.270 align:middle line:90%
Painkillers didn't work.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I was in constant pain.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I had terrible anxiety
and mental stress.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere during this
process of producing the show,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.210 align:middle line:84%
the pain had
completely dropped off.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And I became happier,
and happier, and happier.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I found myself

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:84%
giving birth to this
amazing project that

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.840 align:middle line:84%
was about the healing
of the planet.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
My whole life was changed by
this driving off the cliff.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And having this
experience opened up

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:90%
a whole new world for me.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's brought incredible
riches into my life

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't possibly ever
have dreamed of or imagined.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:84%
My whole vision as a film maker
from this very narrow focus

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:84%
has moved into a more
global focus, Rumi, being

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
a Sufi mystic, who,
in his lifetime,

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:84%
promoted world peace, tolerance
for different religions.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:84%
A quote from Rumi, "I am neither
Muslim, Christian, Buddhist,

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.700 align:middle line:90%
or a Jew.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:90%
I belong to the beloved."

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Working with the Rumi
material certainly

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
has expanded my
vision of the world

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and given me fire
and passion to really

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.620 align:middle line:84%
make a difference in the
world and to touch the minds

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and hearts of many people,
and in keeping with Rumi's

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, encourage tolerance
of people's differences

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and to make a difference
with the ecological crises

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I just feel like
this whole soul story

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.590 align:middle line:84%
has been about
moving from living

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:84%
my life in a very small
container to living

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.135 align:middle line:90%
my life in an ocean of love.

00:10:27.135 --> 00:10:29.075 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1987, I was a
ranger company commander,

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.855 align:middle line:84%
a special operations
infantryman.

00:10:48.855 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And I had been selected by
the Department of the Army

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:84%
to take my company, 235
men, into the Hashemite

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Kingdom of Jordan
to train Jordanian

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Rangers in close combat and
other aspects of warfare.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I was a third-generation
army officer.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I had been raised to be
a soldier by my father.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.450 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing else
in my life that I knew.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I had spent, at this
juncture, 13 years

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:84%
of my life studying art and
science of taking human life.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:90%
I was very good at what I did.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I was very happy about
what I was doing.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
while on a training exercise,

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.420 align:middle line:84%
a Jordanian machine
gun shifted fire.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And a machine gun bullet
traveling at roughly 2,832 feet

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.030 align:middle line:84%
per second struck me
right above my right eye,

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and lodged into
my Kevlar helmet,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and knocked me unconscious for
a period of about 45 minutes.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was during that
time, during that 45 minutes

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:84%
when I was no longer connected
to the conscious world,

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:90%
that I received a visitation.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Something came to me-- an
angel, an entity, a phantom,

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.010 align:middle line:84%
an energy, a ghost, a spirit,
whatever you want to call it,

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're
comfortable with.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:90%
It came to me.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.951 align:middle line:84%
And in the darkness
of my mind, there

00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:84%
in the ethereal world in which
I was now part, it said to me,

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:84%
you have chosen the
wrong path in life.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:90%
You are to choose a new path.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:84%
You are to choose
the path of peace.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:90%
You are to teach peace.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:90%
I had a belief now.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:84%
As a result of
this gunshot wound,

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I had a belief that
there was something more

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:90%
than the physical.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
After I came back from
the deserts of Jordan,

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I left the ranger battalion.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was recruited into
a special access program.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I was recruited to become
what the Department of Defense

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:90%
called a remote viewer.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And remote viewing,
by definition

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
of the Department of Defense,
is the learned ability

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
to transcend time and space
to view persons, places,

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.080 align:middle line:84%
or things remote
in time and space

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and to gather and report
intelligence information

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:90%
on the same.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I began my training
process as a remote viewer

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:90%
in the--

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:84%
operating in the service of
the United States government.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But throughout all of
that, a transformation

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:84%
was unfolding in me each
day that I came to work.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Each day, I was recognizing
the significance

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:84%
of what I was involved
in, and understanding

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
that, this great tool, this
great gift, this great ability

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.480 align:middle line:84%
within each one of
us had to be further

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:84%
developed, and harvested,
and trained into the youth

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
of our planet, and
into the rest of us,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:84%
so that we could change the
outcome of human destiny

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:84%
The truth of that, the purity
of that rang home to me.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And when that occurred,
then I made the decision

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:84%
that I had to violate
a security oath

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and that I had to tell this
story about what I was involved

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:84%
in, that I had to teach the rest
of humanity what it was that I

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
had learned as a result
of this gunshot wound,

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:84%
as a result of my training
as a remote viewer.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And so in exposing this
and in telling this story

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and bringing this
out of the confines

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
of the military
intelligence community

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it out to be
taught at places like Omega,

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle line:84%
to be taught all over the
world, which is what we do now,

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:84%
there were tremendous
repercussions.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And there was a tremendous
price to be paid.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
The lives of my family
members were threatened.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And there were attempts
made on my life.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I was
court-martialed and given

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:84%
an other than
honorable discharge

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:84%
after 18 years of service and
three generations of service

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.820 align:middle line:84%
to this country because I
told the truth about something

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:90%
that I was involved in.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I told the truth to bring
it out so that all of us

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:84%
could benefit from
my experience,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.170 align:middle line:84%
from my transformation,
and from what I had learned

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:90%
in the darkness of the matrix.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:36.030 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, I resigned
my commission.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And I spent about a year just
studying, and researching,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and meditating, and
praying about what

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:90%
it was that I was involved in.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I had made a series of
decisions that ended something

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:90%
that was very promising.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And now I find myself
leaving under other

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:84%
than honorable
conditions and ending

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:84%
all of this, family
falling apart,

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and me, very concerned about
what it was that I was supposed

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:90%
to do with the rest of my life.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.524 align:middle line:84%
I made a decision
to write a book

00:15:02.524 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and tell a story about
what I was involved in,

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:84%
because I believed that this
gift was something that could

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
help change the outcome
of human destiny

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.526 align:middle line:90%
if everyone could learn it.

00:15:11.526 --> 00:15:13.900 align:middle line:84%
It was something that could
help us find a cure for AIDS.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:84%
It was something that could
help us find a cure for cancer.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.040 align:middle line:84%
It could be employed
in scientific research

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and development, in
support of a medical model,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.236 align:middle line:84%
and a law enforcement, model,
and countless other places,

00:15:25.236 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
that each of us

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.790 align:middle line:84%
must define what our personal
mythology will be regarding

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
this, but that its potential
to benefit humankind

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:90%
was unlimited.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:84%
My life began falling
apart because I

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
began struggling between
this new-found awakening

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and my attempts to try
to explain to my family

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.050 align:middle line:84%
what it was that I
was going through.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And my wife asked me to
seek professional help

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and counseling about what
was transpiring with me.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:84%
She was not comfortable
with this transformation

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.175 align:middle line:90%
exactly as it was unfolding.

00:15:59.175 --> 00:16:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And I, of course,
on the other hand,

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.684 align:middle line:84%
was not comfortable with
it either, but I began to--

00:16:04.684 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I was recognizing that there was
something significant about it,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and something good
and positive about it,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:84%
but just hadn't yet been able
to grasp it and fully understand

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So that began a rift
between my wife and I

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:84%
about my failure to follow
through with her request.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.020 align:middle line:84%
There are probably a lot of
people listening that think,

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.230 align:middle line:84%
gunshot wound to the head,
there is some soft tissue damage

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and probably something
electrochemical going on there.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But I assure you,
that was not the case.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it was tough for me
to try to find some place

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:90%
to be some sanctuary.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.160 align:middle line:90%
My family was my sanctuary.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:90%
My career was my sanctuary.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And all of those things began
to peel away from me, my family,

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:84%
because I was making
decisions that affected them

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
because I was making a decision
to tell the truth about what

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:52.920 align:middle line:90%
I was involved in.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.054 align:middle line:84%
And that desperately
affected them.

00:16:55.054 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:90%
That threatened their lives.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:84%
That threatened
their livelihood.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:84%
That threatened their sense
of spiritual well-being,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:84%
because I was going
in a direction that

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:90%
was unfamiliar to them.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I held true to my
love for my family.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And my family supported me even
though my first wife Debbie

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and I eventually divorced under
very amicable circumstances,

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:84%
because we loved
each other, but we

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
recognized that our
lives were going

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:90%
in two different directions.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I had had a spiritual
awakening and a transformation.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:84%
And in a very loving,
supportive way,

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:84%
she blessed me and
allowed me to go and move

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.520 align:middle line:90%
on in a new direction in life.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.830 align:middle line:84%
But I can say to
you, this, that I

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.400 align:middle line:84%
had a life that was focused
on the darkness of humanity.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
My life was focused on
supporting and building

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.220 align:middle line:84%
on all of the negative aspects
of the human condition,

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:84%
on fear, and anger, and
hatred, and animosity,

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and all that that entails.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And as this transformation
has unfolded,

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.530 align:middle line:84%
what has become-- what
has happened to me is,

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I've become a much
more open, blossomed,

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.870 align:middle line:84%
understanding, forgiving,
living a life without judgment,

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
without condemnation, living
trying to do everything

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that I can do each
day in my life

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:84%
to feed the positive
conditions, positive aspects

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:84%
of the human
condition, not trying

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.490 align:middle line:84%
to feed fear and anger because
I'm upset by what happened

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
to me or I don't feel it was
fair that something happened

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.690 align:middle line:84%
over here, but by living
my life in support

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:84%
of the positive, the
love, and the compassion,

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding,
and always focusing

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:84%
my energy in that direction
and not in the other.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:32.926 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.926 --> 00:18:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Jason
[? Hooper. ?] And this is

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:90%
my story.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
painful times was

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:46.360 align:middle line:84%
that the one woman
who, to this day,

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I still think
about as could have

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
been the person for
me, my soul mate,

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to say--

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:84%
we were at the height
of our relationship.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:90%
But some kind of--

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:84%
some kind of an
internal alarm went off.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I had to leave
her and go to a new city.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:90%
I was living in New York City.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had finally come
to love the place,

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
but I felt like I wanted to
be outside, and seek something

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly the "Omega"
catalog came to my door.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I saw this little drawing about
becoming a community member

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and joining the staff,
so I decided to.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.790 align:middle line:84%
It gave me six months to not
worry about food and shelter.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And part of the compensation
for working here

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.081 align:middle line:84%
was you were able
to take a workshop.

00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, which yoga
workshop would I take,

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and didn't really pay
attention to too much else.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:84%
But then I thought
one night, I kind of

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.930 align:middle line:84%
owed it to myself to see
just what else was there,

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:90%
just in case.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And then it came upon
Coordinate Remote Viewing

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:90%
with David Morehouse.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And in there, he
guaranteed to teach you

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:84%
a scientific protocol
used by the CIA

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:90%
to transcend time and space.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
This guy was going to teach me
to transcend time and space.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that happened
to me in the first class

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:84%
was, we do what's called an open
search inward where you go down

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.300 align:middle line:84%
the timeline of your own soul
and you see why you're here,

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:90%
among other things.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:90%
And that a big thing for me.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I should tell you
that before this,

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't talk much for
the first 25 years of my life.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big challenge
for me to connect to people.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And now, here I am
a year later back

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:84%
on the Omega Campus with David
helping people in that way.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's a challenge
for me every time I

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:84%
get up in front of
the room, but it's

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:84%
humbling to see what people
are willing to go through.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So now, with the classes,
I help find, select,

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and develop the videos and
the audiovisual portion

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.100 align:middle line:84%
of the class so
it becomes as much

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.120 align:middle line:84%
of a rich experience
for them as possible.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So when they go somewhere
distant in time and space,

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:84%
we can give them
as much information

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:84%
as possible for where they've
been, and justification to it,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.840 align:middle line:84%
for having experiencing
what they were experiencing.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Also I lead moving
meditation in the mornings

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and some small yoga
practice, gentle yoga,

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.060 align:middle line:90%
depending on where they are.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's a constant challenge
for me personally, day to day,

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:84%
because, here I am, someone
who, their entire life,

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:30.120 align:middle line:84%
was internal and introverted
having to express and open

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.330 align:middle line:84%
up people physically,
when I, for 25 years,

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
was very uncomfortable
with physical contact.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's just to be with them
and help them experience,

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:84%
be open to and accept who they
are, no matter what that is,

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.737 align:middle line:84%
and to understand that
they are part of a family

00:21:45.737 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:90%
when they come to these classes.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.872 align:middle line:90%
And I protect them fiercely.

00:21:48.872 --> 00:21:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And these people are
very important to me.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And anyone that comes in
is treated the same way.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:90%
I love them very much.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
I had been asking
myself for years,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and that I wanted an honest open
direct experience with life,

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:84%
but what I found was that I
needed to really challenge

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:84%
myself and share what
I'd been through,

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.630 align:middle line:84%
because I had put myself through
personal hells for a few years

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I had to go through leaving
the one woman who, to this day,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I still think about
to be here now,

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to
have experienced

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:84%
what I did since that day to
allow myself to share this

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:84%
with the students in class,
and with people I meet,

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and whoever is open
to it, to allow

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:84%
them to be open to their
version of that story.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Because it has helped, I think.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.580 align:middle line:84%
People have thanked me
for when I tell them

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.550 align:middle line:84%
about this or about
other things like it,

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
because there have
been quite a few.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.800 align:middle line:84%
But that, I think that was
the most painful thing,

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:84%
because anytime I'm alone and
walking the street or even

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.920 align:middle line:84%
with someone, I kind of hope
to see her turn the corner.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Every day, I think
of her every day.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:84%
But I still know the
decision was right,

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.390 align:middle line:84%
because what I'm doing now is
important on a scale that's

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.830 align:middle line:90%
beyond me.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's
why I'm really here.
