00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
For most of my life,
I've been a teacher.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And up until 10 years
ago, I've worked

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
with kids of all ages
in different schools.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And about eight years
ago, my husband and I

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.072 align:middle line:84%
were co-teaching a
kindergarten together.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And we were kind
of the mom and pop

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.120 align:middle line:90%
of this little private school.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
It was a really
lovely experience.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:90%
And then everything changed.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:90%
He got melanoma cancer.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was a
child of the '60s.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And I had done all kinds
of spiritual practices

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and been on a lot
of different paths.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I
discovered in that moment

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
that I had never
committed to anything.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to be
able to say to Jim--

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:90%
because he came home to die--

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.680 align:middle line:84%
that no stranger's hand
would ever touch him.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So for many months, I
spent time in the house

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:90%
with his mother caring for him.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:10%
And I had my feet
held to the fire.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And I had to decide what
was going to sustain me.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And the culture
that we live in--

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
it's the visible world
that we believe in.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't believe in
things that are invisible.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.350 align:middle line:84%
There's always kind of
that nagging feeling

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.430 align:middle line:84%
like you need proof
or you want something

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary to happen
before you'll take the leap.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:90%
So I was very afraid.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:90%
And I was also very determined.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered, actually,
while taking care of Jim

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.040 align:middle line:84%
that I was capable
of a lot more than I

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:90%
thought I was capable of.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And I also discovered
that I had the capacity

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
to feel things that I was not
aware before that I could feel.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
For example, I would
put my hands on him

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and discover that I
could take his pain away.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Or I would discover that
I was capable of feeling

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:84%
what pain felt like through
the prickling in my palms.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And I also started to
have extraordinary dreams.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And this continued
after he died.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided that
what I needed to do

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
was to make my grieving a
path of spiritual research,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:90%
I guess you could say.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I started journaling
and spending

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:90%
a lot of time by myself.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have very much money,
but I just kind of withdrew.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:90%
I had great support.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
But I spent a lot of
time writing and thinking

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and praying and trying to figure
out where I was going next.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.947 align:middle line:84%
And I finally
decided that I wanted

00:03:25.947 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:84%
to-- even though I had
been a teacher all my life,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to fulfill a lifelong
dream and become a writer,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
partly to tell the story
of what I was experiencing.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:90%
And things happened very fast.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Within a month, I got an agent.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
But I still hadn't
been published.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And then about five
months after Jim died,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I had a fire ceremony
with some women friends

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to celebrate discovering that
there was some of me that was

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:90%
going to rise out of the ashes.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I said I felt like a
phoenix or was starting

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:90%
to feel like a phoenix.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And about two
weeks after that, I

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
had a live wild river duck
show up inside my wood stove,

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:90%
sitting on the ashes.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it was significant.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't figure it out.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But in the middle of
the night, I woke up.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.730 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh my God.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Jim sent me a phoenix.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:90%
Jim sent me a phoenix.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote him a
letter immediately,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:84%
telling him I figured it out,
recognizing his sense of humor.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And I submitted that letter
to the local newspaper

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:84%
to share with the community
what had happened.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And that was my first
published piece.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:84%
The newspaper invited
me to write a column.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:90%
That led to magazine work.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And within three years,
which was the goal

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that I had set for myself
at age 48 with only a couple

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
of nickels to rub together
and no retirement in sight--

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.330 align:middle line:84%
at the end of three years, I
had a six-figure book contract.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:10%
I would say that in some
ways, I felt very blessed

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.240 align:middle line:10%
through the experiences
that I've had

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:10%
and through really taking
that leap of faith and saying,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:10%
you know, if I don't go here.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:10%
I may not learn
something extraordinary.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I
really want to do.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:84%
It's really put my feet on
a different kind of ground

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and given me a
direction and certainly

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
a certainty that I
didn't have before.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Life continues to
be extraordinary.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:10%
And I guess if I was to say
what were key things in terms

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:10%
of what I learned, it was
that you have to ask for help.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:84%
You have to set a goal, and
you have to ask for help.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.750 align:middle line:84%
You have to give
thanks even when

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:84%
you don't feel like
there's anything to be

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:90%
thankful for when it's hard.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And above all, you
have to take the leap.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:84%
You have to know
that when you go out

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
on a limb that it's important
to keep your heart open

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and that something
wonderful will hold you.

to ovarian cancer.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And we had quite a journey
together while she was ill

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:90%
and while she was dying.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.659 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we talked about
together before she died--

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.840 align:middle line:84%
all of the spiritual literature,
which I basically consumed

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:84%
by the volume while she was
dying to help her through

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:90%
the process--

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:90%
was actually all soul.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of us really had any
traditional religious beliefs

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle line:90%
that we could hang onto.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
But she and I both
needed something

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.020 align:middle line:84%
to hang onto while
she was dying.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.820 align:middle line:90%
It was interesting.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
She actually drew me
into this process,

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.060 align:middle line:84%
saying that you need to
do this journey with me

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.880 align:middle line:84%
because, as a physician,
you need to change things.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.000 align:middle line:84%
You need to change medicine
into something that is not

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.890 align:middle line:90%
cold and hard and scientific.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But you need to help me
tell the world that it needs

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
to expand into something more
loving and something that

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.870 align:middle line:84%
feeds the spirit as well as
feeding or caring for the body.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So the process of
her dying really

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:84%
was her needing information, her
telling me to get it for her,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.455 align:middle line:84%
and then to use it in
the rest of my career.

00:07:33.455 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:84%
While she was
dying, we just spent

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:84%
lots of time talking
about what would come.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And the illness was so bad she
was actually looking forward

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.800 align:middle line:90%
to that process.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, I was looking
forward to that for her

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:84%
as well when it had
gotten very bad.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So in the consumption
of all of this material,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I developed sort of a new
spirituality for myself,

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
as well as one for her, which
assisted her from moving

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.790 align:middle line:90%
from this world to the next.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
we would talk about ways

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
that she might
contact me after she

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
died and half joking but
half serious saying we just

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.477 align:middle line:84%
having signals that we
would send to one another.

00:08:23.477 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:84%
We had done a lot of other
spiritual kinds of work

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:90%
together as well.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.294 align:middle line:84%
But we talked about various
things that she might do.

00:08:30.294 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And we talked
about, oh, maybe she

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.469 align:middle line:84%
could mess with the electricity
or something really simple.

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh, no, no.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.179 align:middle line:84%
I want to do something
really sweet after I pass so

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:90%
that you'll know that I'm here.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know that life goes
on just as we talked about.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So we came up with
a variety of things.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:90%
But she then did go on to die.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And of course, knowing that she
was probably floating around

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:84%
somewhere but not knowing if
I would hear from her again,

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I went to the beach a day
or two after she died.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was walking
along the beach,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.450 align:middle line:84%
listening to the CD that
had the music that was going

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.520 align:middle line:90%
to be at her memorial service.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was playing
it again and again

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and crying, and
playing it, and crying,

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:84%
kept going back to cut number
one on this Eva Cassidy

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
CD, which is a lovely
CD, by the way.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And after I did it about
three times-- cry, cry, cry--

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:84%
it kept jumping off
to song number five.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:90%
And I put it back to one.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.296 align:middle line:90%
It went to five.

00:09:27.296 --> 00:09:28.170 align:middle line:90%
I put it back to one.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.204 align:middle line:90%
It went to five.

00:09:29.204 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Shut it off, put it
on, it went to five.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to listen to song
five, which was "Songbird."

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And in the song, the words
basically are, for you,

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:90%
there will be no crying.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
For you, the sun
will be shining.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And the song goes on
in a very loving way.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
That was contact
number one, I believe.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:90%
The next day, I was back.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.936 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm having
a conversation

00:09:50.936 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:84%
with my dead friend, which
seems like an odd thing to do.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.829 align:middle line:84%
I was saying, you know, we have
this lovely memorial service

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:57.120 align:middle line:90%
which she and I wrote together.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, it would
be really lovely

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
if you sent a butterfly
down or something

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:90%
to sit on my shoulder.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, I could use an
Elisabeth Kübler-Ross kind

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.340 align:middle line:90%
of symbolism with that.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:90%
And we can discuss it.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm laughing at myself
for talking to my dead friend.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:90%
And I forgot about it.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.080 align:middle line:90%
A few hours went by.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I left that beach, drove
by another beach on the way

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.760 align:middle line:90%
to my house.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And a yellow butterfly with
a black spot on each wing

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:90%
landed on my windshield wiper.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And it fluttered at me
through my windshield

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:84%
all the way home, about
8 miles to my house.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I went in my garage, closed the
door, went in, put my hand out.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:90%
The butterfly landed on my hand.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I took it out back,
and it flew away.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
A week later, I'm
out vacuuming my pool

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.640 align:middle line:90%
and doing some yard work.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And a now brown butterfly
with orange spots on the side

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
landed on my shoe, stayed
there five minutes, 10 minutes,

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.487 align:middle line:84%
still there, climbing
up my leg now.

00:10:51.487 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of, at this point,
having a little conversation

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:84%
with who I assume has
been sending me things.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.180 align:middle line:84%
The butterfly did, in fact,
stay with me, now on my thigh,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:84%
for about another 15 minutes,
then vanished into my house

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and was gone to
never be seen again.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
There have been several
other of these stories

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:90%
and several other events.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.870 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom
line in all of this

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
is that she is still
around and that she

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
has come back in many
different ways to show me that.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And I just find
that so comforting.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And I find that so comforting
in my position as a doctor

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
that I can help people in
a whole different way now--

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.142 align:middle line:90%
that it doesn't really end.

00:11:33.142 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's really all.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Just feeling that, knowing it,
having her sent her butterflies

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:84%
to me made it clear to me that
I must do something with this.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.392 align:middle line:90%
She told me I did.

00:11:45.392 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:90%
She's sending me butterflies.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she really
wants this to happen.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that I will do my
best to do that for my friend

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:90%
and for myself.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.890 align:middle line:84%
It's going to change my career,
certainly from emergency room,

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:84%
probably to terminal
care situation, where

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I can hope to convey to people
that, although they may have

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:84%
a terminal illness, that
their life isn't over

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.992 align:middle line:84%
and that their life
will never be over.

00:12:14.992 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
comforting, healing,

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:84%
spiritually healing thing for
the person both who is dying

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and for their family and
for everybody involved.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's changed me completely.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:36.280 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a registered nurse.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also a
certified hypnotherapist

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
and an instructor
in hypnotherapy.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Missouri.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to talk
to you about my soul story.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
In September 23, '99,
my husband was killed

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.740 align:middle line:90%
in an automobile accident.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I had been given a premonition
prior to that in July

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:84%
that he would be dying
before the end of the year.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:84%
This was a new
experience for me.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.485 align:middle line:84%
I had not had that type
of an experience before.

00:13:08.485 --> 00:13:10.300 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.710 align:middle line:90%
I was driving down the road.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it was as if
someone sat beside me and said,

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
you're going to lose him soon.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.972 align:middle line:84%
He won't finish
the year with you.

00:13:19.972 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
tough for a while,

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:90%
but you're going to be OK.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.475 align:middle line:84%
Since this was a totally
new experience for me,

00:13:25.475 --> 00:13:26.275 align:middle line:90%
I was very upset.

00:13:26.275 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I pulled over to
the side of the road

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:84%
more because of this
phenomenon that just had

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:90%
happened than anything else.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I kind of blew it off and got
back to work and on the way.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.349 align:middle line:84%
My husband flew in July,
had to make a flight.

00:13:41.349 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was concerned about
that, talked to him about it.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:90%
He came back.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:90%
He was fine, so I blew it off.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:53.050 align:middle line:84%
In September, he was hit by
two carloads of kids drag

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:57.390 align:middle line:90%
racing down a hilly back road.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:84%
It is quite devastating
to kiss somebody goodbye

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.671 align:middle line:84%
and never see them again
when you have assumed

00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to spend
the rest of your life

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:90%
with that person.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.060 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:84%
The grieving process took
me about a year and a half.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
made it easier was we

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.990 align:middle line:90%
had a very good relationship.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.249 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough, about
10 years prior to his death,

00:14:27.249 --> 00:14:29.540 align:middle line:84%
he was worried about me
getting killed in an automobile

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
accident because I'm
on the highway so much.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And he asked that every
time we left each other,

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:84%
even if it was just to run
to the convenience store,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:84%
that we would say goodbye
as if we might not

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:90%
see each other again.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And we started that about
10 years before his death

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.230 align:middle line:84%
His death was the
beginning of a huge opening

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.070 align:middle line:90%
in my spiritual life.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Since then, my husband
has visited many times,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:84%
came first in forms of smelling
cigarette smoke in the house.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:90%
He was a smoker.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.700 align:middle line:84%
That would be the first
signal that he was there.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I began to ask other people to
understand what was happening.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:84%
He then came to me
in a dream one night

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and introduced me to the next
man that would be in my life.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:84%
My husband said to me,
this is the next person

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:84%
that will be in your life and
assist you with your journey

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:90%
ahead.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.470 align:middle line:84%
He gave me an image,
a very vivid picture

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.130 align:middle line:84%
of this person at an older
age, at a younger age.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And then there was the image of
a young Native American Indian

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:90%
sitting on a horse on a hill.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
This man had long
brown hair, wore pants,

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:90%
but didn't have a shirt on.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And he had a huge
birthmark on his chest.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:84%
My husband in the dream
state then said to me,

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I was here to help
you in the time

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.200 align:middle line:84%
that you needed with
raising the children,

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
the other technical
parts of living.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
This man is now going to help
you with your spiritual journey

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:90%
ahead.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.930 align:middle line:84%
When I awoke that
morning, I really

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:84%
just thought, wasn't that
an interesting experience,

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and didn't pay much
attention to it.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I put my glasses on,
took my wedding ring off

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.190 align:middle line:84%
the side of the
table, and put it on.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And as I walked
out of the bedroom,

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
I noticed something was
wrong with my wedding band.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked down, it was
rather a large wedding band.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.980 align:middle line:90%
And it had been broke in two.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:84%
It just snapped completely
in two at the base of it.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was fine when I
went to bed at night.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:90%
By February, I met this person.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:90%
It's the very same person.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And he also has a
birthmark on his chest

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:84%
that was shown to
me in the vision.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Since then, I am able
to do channeling.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I am open very easily
to the universe

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and receiving lots of spiritual
information and guidance.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:84%
It's been absolutely a
wonderful growth experience.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:84%
I'm very fortunate
that I had 27 years

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:90%
with a very wonderful person.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And now I get to move forward
into my spiritual growth

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:84%
with the universe and proceed
in learning the knowledge that's

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:90%
there for me.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I am so far now from the
person I was several years ago.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I do not practice nursing
full-time anymore.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:90%
I am a hypnotherapist now.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I was very analytical
in my thinking

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and would have never
believed any of this.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Through hypnosis,
that was the beginning

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.070 align:middle line:90%
of opening my subconscious.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And by opening the
subconscious, it's

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:84%
as if then I was able to begin
to receive the information that

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
was there for me
in the universe.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:90%
I now enjoy every moment.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.510 align:middle line:90%
I now live in the moment more.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't assume that I can stop
and smell that flower tomorrow,

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:84%
because that flower may
not be there tomorrow.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So I enjoy the simple
pleasures of life

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.775 align:middle line:90%
far more than I ever did before.

00:18:16.775 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I feel there is no
such thing as death,

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:84%
that there is
simply a transition

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.450 align:middle line:90%
to different levels of energy.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:84%
It's given me an
awareness and an insight

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.965 align:middle line:84%
that gives me peace and an inner
calm that I didn't have before.

00:18:34.965 --> 00:18:40.563 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.563 --> 00:18:43.950 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a very dear
friend of mine, Katherine.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And we had just finished
a weekend workshop

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that focused on living
with the things that

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:90%
are hard in your life.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And we were cleaning up my home
when Katherine had a headache.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her, and she
had a brain aneurysm burst.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.800 align:middle line:90%
And I drove her to the hospital.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:84%
She died in the car, in the
ambulance a couple of times.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:84%
We eventually got an
ambulance and was resuscitated

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.470 align:middle line:90%
and then went into a coma.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And my initial reaction
to all of that--

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:84%
because I had been trained
in a lot of shamanic healing,

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and it was just a
gut reaction-- was

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.959 align:middle line:84%
to grab her and hang onto her
with everything that I had.

00:19:22.959 --> 00:19:23.875 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:19:23.875 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't want
to let her go.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And she was in a
coma for five weeks.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:90%
And we waited, and we prayed.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:90%
And we waited.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.021 align:middle line:84%
And then the
hospital chaplain had

00:19:40.021 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
came and said that we needed
to take her off the respirator,

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.800 align:middle line:84%
that she wasn't going to come
to, that 80% of her brain

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.966 align:middle line:90%
had been flooded with blood.

00:19:45.966 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So even if she, did she would
be incapable of doing anything.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And I went out and sat in
the local park and meditated.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And I had this very strong
sense the whole time

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.790 align:middle line:90%
of being connected to Katherine.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.274 align:middle line:90%
And I saw her in my mind's eye.

00:19:59.274 --> 00:20:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her,
they want to turn off

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.023 align:middle line:90%
the respirator, Katherine.

00:20:02.023 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to do?

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:90%
And she said, give me 24 hours.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So I told her
husband, Roger, this.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.228 align:middle line:84%
And he told the chaplain
we need 24 hours set aside.

00:20:12.228 --> 00:20:14.269 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, Katherine
came out of the coma.

00:20:14.269 --> 00:20:19.260 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So when she came
out of the coma,

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.540 align:middle line:84%
there was a moment of thinking,
everything was exactly

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:84%
as it had been,
that she was going

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:84%
to be 100% who she had been
in every way, shape, and form.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.064 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when they
took the respirator out

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and she could
speak, we discovered

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.760 align:middle line:84%
that she could recognize
her mother and myself.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:84%
She didn't recognize
her husband.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:84%
She knew all the prayers and all
the chants we had ever learned.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.770 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know how to use
a toothbrush or a spoon.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And she's had a
very long struggle

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:51.120 align:middle line:84%
of patching together her memory
of learning to walk again.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:90%
She's partially paralyzed.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I certainly had an enormous
amount of ambivalence

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
about whether I had done
Katharine any favor.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:84%
The doctors were very
clear that had she

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.790 align:middle line:84%
been on the road,
which was where

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
she was headed or whatnot,
that she would have died--

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:12.200 align:middle line:84%
that given the circumstances
of the moment and my being

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.390 align:middle line:84%
there, that that was
why she had lived.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Watching her struggle, I
had incredible ambivalence

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.620 align:middle line:84%
about whether I had
done her any favor.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.060 align:middle line:90%
She's very clear.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:84%
She is happy for every
day that she's alive.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And she's very clear that
she chose to be alive.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.490 align:middle line:84%
She has very clear memories
of those conversations

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.410 align:middle line:84%
we had when she was in a coma
and I would meditate and speak

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:90%
to her.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:84%
That she remembers
clear as a bell.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Being with Katherine when she
went through the brain aneurysm

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:90%
was a kind of abrupt awakening.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:84%
When someone close
to you or you has

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.110 align:middle line:84%
a very close call with death
or gets a fatal prognosis,

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
it's a reminder of
what we don't know.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this is my
last 30 seconds before a brain

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.840 align:middle line:90%
aneurysm burst for me.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.640 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Katherine and I were standing
in the kitchen chatting.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Everything was the way
it had been for years.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle line:90%
There's no way to know.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And so to live your
life fully-- and also

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.110 align:middle line:90%
that there are no deals.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
A number of people
said to me, well,

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:84%
what do you think Katherine
did that brought this

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:90%
into her life?

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say,
that's a crazy kind of notion.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.550 align:middle line:84%
We can't possibly
know what causes

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.220 align:middle line:84%
something like this, whether
purely physical or otherwise.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:84%
We can say what we've
learned from it.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And what I've learned is
that there are no deals.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:84%
If you are doing spiritual
work, a spiritual practice

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:84%
in the hopes that the universe
will reward you with safety

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:90%
from tragedy, it's an illusion.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a fantasy.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.905 align:middle line:90%
Life includes suffering.

00:22:42.905 --> 00:22:45.950 align:middle line:90%
It includes unexpected tragedy.

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And what a spiritual
practice and path does

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:84%
is help you expand
and hold all of it.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But you don't miss
parts of it then.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't get exempted from
certain personal tragedies.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.760 align:middle line:84%
That's still going to come to
you like it does to everyone.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:90%
