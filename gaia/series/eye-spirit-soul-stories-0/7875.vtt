00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And how I got where I am is some
sort of a mystery to myself.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Because before 1976,
I was a socialite,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:84%
living in a big, four story
Georgian mansion, married

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:90%
to a US circuit court judge.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And actually, a
hardcore Republican--

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:90%
I have to laugh about that now.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.585 align:middle line:84%
I wore a French twist,
Neiman-Marcus clothes.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I drove a Continental Mark III
at the time and a Mercedes.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And all of my life was taken up
with doing some volunteer work,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:84%
but mostly giving dinner
parties and showing off

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
my beautiful four
story Georgian home.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I would
walk in a room, I

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.270 align:middle line:84%
would just stand there,
plastic as I can be.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
It would be, like, I can hardly
even relate to that me now,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.180 align:middle line:90%
when I think about how I was.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And one day, over
a Chinese lunch,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:84%
I realized that my
marriage was dead

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and that I had to leave the
only life I'd ever been familiar

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And I remember walking
out of that restaurant

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:90%
that day so devastated.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
I really thought that I
was going to kill myself.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:90%
And I stumbled around.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Went to my best friend's
house and sat in her driveway

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.069 align:middle line:90%
for several hours.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't even home.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:90%
She was on vacation.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I drove
home, got in my bed,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
pulled the covers over
my head, and begged God

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:90%
to just take me out of my body.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And of course, God
didn't exactly do that.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:84%
What actually happened
is a voice boomed

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:84%
in my head, a very loud,
masculine voice that said,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.230 align:middle line:84%
go in your study and read
"Discipleship of The New Age,"

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Volume Two, page 146.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I remember I sat straight
up in bed and thought,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:90%
now I'm really crazy.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm having an auditory
hallucination.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turned out that
I did go in my study,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:90%
and I opened the book.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I opened
it to page 146,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.130 align:middle line:84%
it said you are one of
the ones who will write

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:90%
a book for the new psychology.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And it gave a little description
about what this new psychology

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:84%
would be, that it would
have a much stronger

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.600 align:middle line:84%
evolutionary purpose than
any of the psychologies that

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:90%
had come before it.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And that I would be
guided in this work

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and would write this book in
the crucible of my daily life.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking at the time,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.546 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to write a
book on the new psychology

00:03:29.546 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not even a psychologist?

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And yet I knew, somehow,
that message was for me.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
main thing about it

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that grabbed me so hard was that
it gave me a reason to live.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:90%
It gave me a sense of purpose.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And it reminded me of
the self that I really am

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and who I really
came here to be.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.490 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And when I think back on why
it was that message meant

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:84%
so much to me, it's because
my old life had died

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and I could no longer be
the socialite Jacqueline

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:90%
that I had been in Texas.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:84%
My life was so transformed after
that time and after that death.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
When I realized I was going to
have to go through a divorce

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and end the life
I was so used to,

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:84%
which was very frightening
to me at the time,

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I plopped
down on the bed that day,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
begging God to take
me out of my body.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.654 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize it then, but
in looking back on it now,

00:04:30.654 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I realized what
had happened to me

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:84%
is I was in a complete
ego death, which

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:90%
can lead to suicide.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
It can lead to such a
discombobulation of the self

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:84%
that you can wind up
in a psychotic episode.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately for me,
mine did not turn out

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:90%
to be a psychotic episode.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
It turned out to be
a spiritual crisis

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and introduced me very
experientially to my own soul.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
When I read the
message in the book,

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:90%
I knew the message was for me.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:90%
And it gave me a reason to live.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:84%
It was like a
reminder of some me

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:84%
that I've always been that
I had been out of touch

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
with, as though I went back
into some sort of cosmic reality

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and remembered why I had come
to this world, what I was really

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.730 align:middle line:90%
here to do and be.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And even though I didn't have
a support group or anyone

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:84%
around me at the time to
help me with this, what I did

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:84%
is I began gathering
notes and listening

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.240 align:middle line:84%
to the guidance that was coming
through about writing the book.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was so
inspired that that's

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
what kept me going until my new
life began to build around me

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and I began to become the
spiritual psychologist

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:90%
that I now am.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after that, I began
hearing these passages come

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.310 align:middle line:84%
through my mind about
levels of consciousness

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.290 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't
really know existed.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:90%
And I started taking notes.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And the book that I wrote,
which took four years to do,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:84%
is called "Transformers, The
Artists of Self-Creation."

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And the book came about
just exactly the way

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.264 align:middle line:84%
the message told
me that it would.

00:06:11.264 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:84%
The message even went
further to tell me

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.920 align:middle line:84%
that I would be guided
into meeting people who

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:84%
would help me bring
forward my life's work.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And I do run a company now
called Eupsychia, which

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:90%
means well-being in Greek.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're teaching people all
about soul-based psychology.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's all based
in the material

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.245 align:middle line:84%
that came from that book that
day and came from that message.

00:06:37.245 --> 00:06:41.350 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just so grateful.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Because the book was
written exactly the way

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:84%
the message told me
that it would be,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I really know now how it is
that our creativity happens.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.630 align:middle line:84%
It happens when our ego
gets out of the way,

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and we're just wide
open, and we're

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
receiving a message
straight from our own higher

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:90%
self, which is our soul.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm from New Jersey.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.408 align:middle line:10%
And I want to tell
you a story that

00:07:13.408 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:10%
really transformed my life.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:10%
And I hope somehow this
will help someone out there.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.530 align:middle line:10%
About two years ago, I
went on a spiritual journey

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:10%
with one of my friends and
we went out to New Mexico.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:10%
And we were going into the
mountains and praying every day

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:10%
and asking Creator what we
can do to help heal the Earth

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:10%
and make it a better
world and any way

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle line:10%
that we could be of service.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:10%
And that was a
wonderful experience.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But the part that really
totally transformed my life

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.480 align:middle line:84%
was one evening,
during twilight time,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
we went back to our
hotel room, which

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.660 align:middle line:84%
was just this regular,
like, Motel 6 kind

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:90%
of crummy, little hotel room.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.610 align:middle line:90%
And we're just sitting down.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:90%
She's on the bed.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting against the wall
with my back against the wall.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was, like, I said
twilight time outside.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And our room-- we had
purposely made it dark.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And we just put a candle out
so we could see each other.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.851 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at my
friend, and all of a sudden,

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I felt like there was something
going on with my eyes.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:84%
But I said, Sandra, you're
not going to believe this.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:90%
She said, what is it?

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I said you are
turning into light.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't see
your body anymore.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:84%
All I see is your
outline with total light.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Miriam, you're
not going to believe this.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:90%
I said, what is it?

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.350 align:middle line:90%
And she said look at yourself.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at myself
and I was complete light.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:90%
And we weren't in meditation.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.440 align:middle line:84%
We weren't doing
anything special.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:90%
It was just unbelievable.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:90%
We were both laughing.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't freaked out and
neither was she at the time.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I really felt like I had no
boundaries, that everything

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
was interconnected, that cosmic
consciousness of everything

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:84%
being related and
interconnected,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:90%
and we're all one.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.350 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes we forget that.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So that revelation came
to me immediately, and so

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.280 align:middle line:84%
did it come to my friend,
and it was just amazing.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to
where I was sitting.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I was
thinking home, going home.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And I felt all this love
and tremendous light

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:84%
was coming into the
room, like waves

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and waves of tremendous cosmic
love was coming into the room.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:90%
And we both felt it.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
my friend says, Miriam,

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:90%
you're starting to disappear.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:90%
I said what?

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.210 align:middle line:90%
So I looked at myself.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And actually, my legs
were no longer there.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And as I was looking up, there
was very little of me left.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I was going
up to that next level, which

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:84%
is whatever you want to
call heaven or upper world.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And I knew if I had
gone the whole way,

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.170 align:middle line:84%
I would not be
able to come back.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Something just said,
you know, in my head.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.015 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I would be
home and that would be it.

00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
you know you're not

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:90%
supposed to go there yet.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:90%
You have to come back.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I said, I know, but I
don't want to come back.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to come
back, because there

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
was so much incredible
love, like I've never

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:90%
felt in my life.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But I knew 1% in me
knew I had to come back

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:84%
because I have a purpose
here, just as we all do.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Right after it happened,
it was completely amazing

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:90%
for both of us.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, for me, for a
year, to be honest with you,

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:43.070 align:middle line:84%
it was very hard for me to
be back here in this reality.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.130 align:middle line:90%
I was crying all the time.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.364 align:middle line:84%
I would go down to the
basement, and my family

00:10:47.364 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:90%
would say what's the matter?

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:90%
What's the matter?

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't explain to them
that I was so incredibly upset.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:90%
But I realized, you know what?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:90%
I chose to be here.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to be here, and I
want to bring as much light

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:90%
and love into this world.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's what
we're all supposed to do.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm always doing healing work.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:90%
I do Reiki.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:90%
I run meditation workshops.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:90%
I've gotten into kabbalah.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm also a spirit coach now.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always asking Creator,
what do you want me to do now?

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:90%
What do you want me to do now?

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So whatever
opportunity I can take

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:84%
to possibly spread some
more light and love,

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:90%
that's what I do.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And I just keep
following that journey.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just letting
other people that have not

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.330 align:middle line:84%
had this kind of experience
to know that this is real,

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.527 align:middle line:90%
and this is for everybody.

00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:46.110 align:middle line:84%
But we're all here
to help each other.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I know that much.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:84%
We're all here to be one
family and help each other out

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:90%
while we're on this Earth plane.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And when it's my
time to go back,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
just like when it's all of
our time, we will be home.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.480 align:middle line:90%
But this is our home, too.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm someone who's a product
of a dysfunctional family,

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.930 align:middle line:90%
alcohol and drugs.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle line:84%
I was born in
Baltimore, Maryland.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:84%
My mother, my grandmother,
and six or seven aunts

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:84%
were basically the people
who were raising me.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And we lived in a
three story house,

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and I was the only
male in there.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So I had a lot of
women around me.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that
I was very fortunate.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:90%
All my needs were met.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.700 align:middle line:84%
For words of understanding,
I was a spoiled brat.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was put into
nice schools and all.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:90%
I overachieved.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
My mother was diagnosed
with tuberculosis

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:90%
when I was 11 years old.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And for the next three
years, she was hospitalized.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So I was moved around
from family to family,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's when this structure
that was set up for me

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
really started to
fall to pieces.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I was no longer getting the
love and the nourishment

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
from my mother and my
grandmother and aunt who really

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:90%
had my best interests at heart.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
My other relatives
that I started

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:84%
to stay with for the
next three to four years

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:90%
had their own kids.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.150 align:middle line:90%
They had their own priorities.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
someone who was just--

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.090 align:middle line:90%
I guess just taking up space.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Or they was taking me in and
just helping the family out.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Quite a few of them were
into drugs and alcohol.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact, they
were known on the streets

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.095 align:middle line:10%
as drug users and drug pushers.

00:13:49.095 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.460 align:middle line:84%
It really became--
it became very

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.340 align:middle line:84%
comfortable to be
around them, to learn

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
from them what the tricks and
trade for how they were doing.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.798 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were more
than willing to learn me

00:14:02.798 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:90%
how to do it.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I started to do.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:90%
I worked, and I sold drugs.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I got
pretty good with it,

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I started having other
people sell drugs for me.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:23.805 align:middle line:84%
There came a time in my second
marriage that my wife then

00:14:23.805 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and I both started to
use drugs very heavily.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:31.990 align:middle line:84%
It got very bad, the things
that you have to do that--

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.220 align:middle line:84%
the lying, the
cheating, the stealing.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Then there came a
point in time where

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:90%
it was nothing but the drugs.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I no longer could do
drugs just for the kicks.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.955 align:middle line:90%
I had to do drugs to function.

00:14:51.955 --> 00:14:55.689 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way that
I could do anything.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.880 align:middle line:84%
If I was going to work,
I had to do drugs.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.260 align:middle line:84%
If I was going to a
concert, I had to do drugs.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I had to do drugs sometimes
even before I ate.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:90%
It just became so out of hand.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:84%
In doing that, you start to
lose all your self-esteem, all

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.570 align:middle line:84%
your respect for yourself,
anything else around you.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:84%
You start the cheating and
lying, even with the people

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.205 align:middle line:90%
who are giving you the drugs.

00:15:23.205 --> 00:15:25.080 align:middle line:10%
So the only thing that
was left for me then--

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.450 align:middle line:10%
I mean, no one else
could trust me--

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:34.410 align:middle line:10%
was to go on the streets, in
the streets, into the shelters.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I used to watch other
addicts on the street.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And I used to watch them
go into shooting galleries.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself
I would never do that.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I guess the real
turning point for me

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:49.110 align:middle line:84%
was when, this one particular
day when I was homeless,

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I went into an
abandoned building.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:90%
And it was pouring down rain.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was only
like 2, 3 blocks

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.989 align:middle line:90%
from where my kids lived.

00:15:59.989 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And when I came out
of that building.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I saw my youngest daughter.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:90%
She saw me come out.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the most
awesome feelings I ever had.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:90%
She knew that I used drugs.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.550 align:middle line:84%
But to see me come out of
a shooting gallery house

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:20.215 align:middle line:84%
was something that it just sent
all kinds of stuff through me.

00:16:20.215 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling that--

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even to today, I
mean, I have told this story

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:90%
a few times--

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's still very, very
hard still to talk about.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.410 align:middle line:90%
It was just a feeling that--

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:84%
feeling worthless,
no respect from her.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:90%
It was just so devastating.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.050 align:middle line:90%
It was devastating enough that--

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:43.876 align:middle line:84%
the homeless shelter
that I was staying at,

00:16:43.876 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:90%
they had a counselor there.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And that evening when I went in,
for the first time in my life,

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.030 align:middle line:90%
I really asked for their help.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:54.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was just that powerful.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:90%
It was just that powerful.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I remember sitting and
talking with my daughter

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:90%
a couple of days later.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:07.069 align:middle line:84%
And she just basically
disowned me, you know?

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, she knew that
her father used drugs.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.230 align:middle line:84%
But to see me come
out a place that she

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.569 align:middle line:84%
had seen so many other
people come out of,

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it sent a very powerful
message to her that, you know,

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
not only is her
father just homeless,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:84%
but he's just like the
rest of them, you know?

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:25.130 align:middle line:90%
He'll never be anyone, you know?

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.720 align:middle line:90%
I love my kids very much.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what I was doing,
even starting the recovery

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.300 align:middle line:84%
process, even the thought about
doing the recovery process,

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.010 align:middle line:84%
I based it on doing
it for my kids.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.680 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't for me.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.992 align:middle line:84%
It was just knowing that
she didn't love me anymore.

00:17:41.992 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't want to have
anything to do with me anymore.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:90%
And she was my baby.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:84%
In my downward spiral,
of my three kids,

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:84%
she was the one who really
stayed in contact with me

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:90%
to be supportive.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:84%
When I was homeless, she was say
to Mommy, can Daddy stay here?

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.572 align:middle line:84%
And it was just that poignant
moment when she saw me--

00:18:02.572 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't think
about that myself.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking that, you
knoe, that I really, really--

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.810 align:middle line:90%
I really lost her.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:90%
I really lost her.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that the
other two, my two oldest,

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.420 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to have anything
to do with me, I mean,

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:90%
she was, like, my last link.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was just something
inside me that--

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't want to lose her.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to lose her.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.840 align:middle line:84%
As I understand, I wind
up doing it for me.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But that was a
turning point for me,

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.570 align:middle line:84%
as I look back, that
gave me the strength

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
or made me pay more
attention to, you know,

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.962 align:middle line:84%
I really need to
do something here.

00:18:38.962 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't for that, I
don't know where I would be.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But that was a
turning point for me.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of
it was that I just

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:84%
did what I had to do to stay
clean and give my program.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:84%
It just had made so many things
in my life possible, free

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:90%
of guilt and resentment.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.930 align:middle line:84%
It has gotten my son, my two
daughters back in my life.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:84%
It just has opened up
a whole different world

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:84%
for me, the respect that
not only I have for myself,

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:84%
but people actually respect
me because-- of just who I am.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.856 align:middle line:90%
It's been very powerful.

00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.614 align:middle line:90%
I'm just very blessed.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm just very blessed.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.194 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.194 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:84%
But that moment
with my daughter--

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was that moment
when our eyes touched.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:84%
It was just something just
went through me that I just

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.199 align:middle line:84%
knew that I couldn't
do this anymore.

00:19:29.199 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
I was going to do.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I couldn't
do it anymore.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
of seeing her.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:40.820 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> My story started in 1995,
when I hadn't been to Israel

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.210 align:middle line:84%
for five years and I
felt the need to go back.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And prior to that,
in 1990, I had

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.970 align:middle line:84%
made a documentary about
the Women's peace movement

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.400 align:middle line:84%
in Israel, the West
Bank, and Gaza.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had that notion,
that wouldn't it

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:84%
be nice to go back to Israel
and do a sequel to the film

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:90%
that I made?

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.740 align:middle line:84%
But this time, when I went
in 1995, I had no money,

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:90%
and I was pretty poor.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:84%
I remember that before
I left for Israel,

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I had been in a very
spiritual space in my life.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.886 align:middle line:84%
I felt that something
was going to happen.

00:20:22.886 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.430 align:middle line:84%
But I had a feeling that
something was going to happen.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking that I will

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.960 align:middle line:84%
feel and be open to anything
that will happen and go

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:90%
with the flow.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.360 align:middle line:90%
I went to Israel.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And on the first
day that I arrived,

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I went to see a
friend of mine in one

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:90%
of those studios in Tel Aviv.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing he said to me

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.820 align:middle line:84%
was, Shuli Eshel,
what are you going

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:90%
to do now that you are here?

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
was thinking of doing

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:57.720 align:middle line:84%
this documentary about a sequel
to the Women's peace movement.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I have just
the right woman to introduce

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:90%
you to.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, there
was a knock on the door.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:90%
And the woman walked in.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
this is Shuli Eshel.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:90%
I want you to meet her.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:90%
She wants to make a film.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:84%
This woman who walked
in, Miriam Spielman,

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:84%
was one of the owners of
that big studio in Israel.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And she got very excited
about the subject.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And she then said,
well, how were

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:90%
you thinking of paying for it?

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And I took a pen and I wrote
down two shooting days, $3,000.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I had a feeling

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:84%
that I had to put my
mouth where my money was.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I will pay 50%.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:90%
She took out her hand.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:90%
We shook hands.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of that documentary

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:90%
that I produced.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
At that time when I went
to Israel, I stayed.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:90%
I prolonged my stay.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And in five weeks,
I finished a film.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:84%
That night, I heard an
inner voice talk to me

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and the inner voice
said that, as long

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
as I will be a good person
and bring love to the world

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and live in balance and
not be greedy and be

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
participatory in life, I
will have everything I need

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.570 align:middle line:90%
from that moment until I die.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>> The most important thing--

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>> And that really happened.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I finished the film.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I went back to
the United States.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:90%
And money just started pouring.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:90%
My company flourished.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I had just started a company
a year and a half before that.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:84%
We were almost going
to close the company.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:90%
We had no money.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.170 align:middle line:90%
No projects were coming in.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And after that experience, which
I call a spiritual experience,

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
money just started pouring
and work started pouring in.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's just an amazing,
amazing turnaround

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:90%
of events in my life.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's really, in some way, I
believe it is to do with trust

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and believing in God and
trusting the universe.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought that
that would maybe, hopefully,

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.560 align:middle line:84%
help and encourage and
inspire some other people.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:33.334 align:middle line:90%
