at the Omega Institute.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm also the director of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a photographer
specializing

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.060 align:middle line:90%
in photographs of Tibet.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
My life has taken a
very long journey,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and I want to tell you the story
starting back in 1967, when

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:90%
I was 11 years old.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:84%
At that time I went to India
with my parents and my two

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:90%
sisters.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And India had a very
profound impact on me.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I was going to an Indian
school, and after school

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:84%
all the other children
were going to dance class.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And I followed
them, and I started

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:90%
studying dancing at that time.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And that became a passion
that is still with me today.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Being at Omega has
been incredible for me

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:90%
because I work seasonally.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I work here for five
months, and then I

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.440 align:middle line:90%
have the next seven months free.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been going to
Asia for the last 11 years

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.367 align:middle line:90%
every winter.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And my first summer at
Omega, which was 1991,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:90%
was totally profound for me.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
There was a Tibetan
musician here

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:84%
who was teaching
meditation, and I met him.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a book that
totally changed my life.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:84%
This book was "Freedom in Exile"
by His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:84%
It's his autobiography,
and it also

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:84%
shares what happened to him in
Tibet and why he left Tibet.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And I remember working in
the daytime doing massage,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and every night
running back to my tent

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:84%
where I was living
to read his book.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
summer, His Holiness

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
the Dalai Lama actually
came to New York

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
City for a big initiation called
the Kalachakra Initiation.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:90%
And I went to New York.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:90%
I was initiated by him.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I felt yes, I've
really met my teacher.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
At Madison Square
Garden there were many,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:84%
many papers out on tables about
how to help Tibetan people.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So I remember going through all
these brochures and thinking,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I've really got to
help some Tibetans.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And I picked up one
brochure and started

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:90%
sponsoring somebody in India.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
That went on until
1994, but in my heart,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I really personally wanted
to go to Dharamshala,

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.850 align:middle line:84%
where the Dalai Lama
works and lives.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:90%
And so in 1994 I went to India.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And I first decided to go on
a retreat in Bodh Gaya, where

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:84%
the Buddha actually
got enlightened.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I went on this
wonderful retreat.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
After that I went
up to Dharamshala

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and started to
photograph, trying

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:84%
to capture the images that
moved me and that I felt

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.935 align:middle line:84%
would move people back
in the United States.

00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to take these
images here and let

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:84%
the images themselves speak
to the people about what

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
was happening in Tibet and
to the refugees in India.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
My mother had given me
a small amount of money,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.853 align:middle line:84%
and she said, give this somebody
in Dharamshala who needs help.

00:04:16.853 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:84%
And the whole time I was
there--I think I was there,

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:90%
like, three months--

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:84%
I kept waiting for
the right person,

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.790 align:middle line:84%
not knowing who it would be,
but feeling I should wait.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:84%
A couple of days before
I left Dharamshala,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:90%
a student of mine--

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:90%
I was teaching English--

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
he took out a photo, and he
said, this is a very sad story,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:84%
but it could be a
very happy story.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what do you mean?

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And he said this is
a really poor baby.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
bring me to the baby.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So he brought me to the
parents and the baby,

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and I immediately fell
in love with the baby.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And I gave the donation
from my mother,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and that was the beginning
of the relief project.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:90%
I still know this little girl.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
She's now seven years old
because our relief project

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:90%
is that old.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is just as
I was leaving Dharamshala,

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
the parents gave me something
wrapped up in a newspaper.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:90%
And I was on a bus.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
When I pulled out, I
looked in the newspaper,

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was this beautiful
Tibetan dress called a chuba.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I was so moved by their
generosity towards me,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.860 align:middle line:84%
that the mother had given
me her very best dress.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And they were so poor.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
She probably had, like, this
just one or two dresses.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:10%
And I told that
story to people here,

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.370 align:middle line:10%
and donations
started to come in.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So the next year I was able to
return to India with much more

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.400 align:middle line:84%
than just my mother's
money and started

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:90%
to actually help people.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetan Relief Project
has meant so much to me

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's connected
me with being

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.980 align:middle line:90%
able to help so many Tibetans.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And with so many wonderful
people in America,

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
I've made wonderful,
wonderful friends here

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.575 align:middle line:84%
who year after year have
been supporting the project.

00:06:18.575 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.040 align:middle line:84%
It's gotten me back
into dancing because one

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.840 align:middle line:84%
of the recipients of the project
is a musician and a dancer.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me if I
would dance with him.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So lo and behold,
I'm dancing again.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
These are the boots
that I dance with.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:84%
There actually has been a lot
of struggle with this story.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been an easy unfolding
because of finances, mainly.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing massage
to support myself,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and then packing up
all the things I have,

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:84%
leaving them at my parents',
going homeless overseas.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So I've struggled with almost
like a divided life, doing

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.860 align:middle line:84%
something to support
myself, which

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:90%
my heart wasn't totally in.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:84%
But I had to do it in order
to live the dream that I have

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:90%
for the other part of the year.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.140 align:middle line:84%
People often ask me,
why do you love India?

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Or why do you love Tibetans?

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And I find it very difficult
to give a good explanation.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like my soul resonates
when I'm among Tibetan people.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like
I've come at home.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I think the spiritual
essence of life

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.680 align:middle line:84%
being so important in India
and in the TIbertan culture.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I find that although there's
a growing movement in America

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:84%
for spirituality, it's not
part of the everyday life.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:11.268 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.268 --> 00:08:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's that element that
has spoken to me so strongly

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.470 align:middle line:90%
in Asia that means a lot.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:32.130 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I was born in Ghana
when it was still a colony.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.570 align:middle line:84%
My name, Kofi, means
Boy Born on Friday.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And my name, my middle
name, Amaniampong,

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
is the name of one of
our great ancestors.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And as is the custom
where I come from,

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
you do your best to name
people after honored people

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:84%
in the past in
the hope that they

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:84%
will replicate that and
bring that greatness out in

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Whether I have done
this or not I can't say,

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:90%
but that's my name.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.150 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.110 align:middle line:84%
A very important
moment in my life,

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I guess, that affected me
deeply, as you can see,

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm an African.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is a strange world
because to some people

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:84%
it makes no difference at
all, and to other people

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
it makes a great
deal of difference

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:90%
that I am an African.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one
moment in particular.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.900 align:middle line:90%
I had grown up with my parents.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
They had always loved
me and they had always

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
provided a home for me to
go to whenever I met trouble

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And up to a certain point, when
other people had said things

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.060 align:middle line:84%
to me, shouted names at
me, all sorts of things

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:84%
like that, that never
really bothered me

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.110 align:middle line:84%
because I'd always been able
to go home to my parents.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:90%
But you grow.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.380 align:middle line:90%
I went to university.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
I went through the things people
in my position so often do.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
You would call up, you would
want to rent a room in a house.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.950 align:middle line:84%
They would say we
have rooms, they

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:84%
would hear your
impeccable Oxford accent,

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:84%
they would know you were the
kind of person they wanted.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.900 align:middle line:84%
You showed up five
minutes later.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly all rooms are gone.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So to solve that problem,
I just said to my friends,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.960 align:middle line:90%
I will cook.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Anybody finds me a place
to live, I'll cook.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:90%
So I got somewhere to live.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And a long time after that,
I wanted to get married.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:90%
And I had fallen in love.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
She was a white girl,
but didn't matter to me.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Didn't seem to matter to her.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Then came the great day that
I went to meet her parents.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly the
color of my skin

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.990 align:middle line:84%
made a great deal of difference
to my future mother-in-law.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And this was different
because this time I really

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.820 align:middle line:84%
wanted something, and
my ability to get it

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:84%
depended on somebody else
accepting that I was just

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:90%
a simple, ordinary human being.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And there was
absolutely nothing I

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
could do to convince the
mother of the woman I

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
wanted to marry that I was
just an ordinary human being.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
It made me shake my head
because what can you

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:90%
do to get somebody to like you?

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be loved and
I wanted to be liked.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:84%
What can you do to get
somebody to love you

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:84%
when they have something against
you that is, in their eyes,

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.600 align:middle line:90%
so reasonable?

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I got long lectures
on how there were

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.360 align:middle line:84%
going to be difficulties
in marrying a white person.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And especially they
said there were

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
going to be difficulties
in the children.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I was going to produce
half-colored children,

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and they were going
to have problems.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Eventually the whole
thing made me so sad,

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.130 align:middle line:90%
and I got more and more sad.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And then one day I looked up
and I thought, I have a mother.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:90%
I have a family.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:90%
I have people who do love me.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And I went home and
I saw my mother,

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and she said, one day you
will put all this behind you.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.320 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, no, no.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I said, nobody will
ever love me again.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And to cut a long story short,
I did put all of this behind me,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and my mother was quite correct.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Six months later I met someone
else, and we got married.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very content.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And the strange thing is,
I married a different woman

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:90%
and she was white.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And we produced
half-colored children.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And if they are having
troubles in life,

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.830 align:middle line:84%
they keep it very, very
well hidden from me.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Are we happy?

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.448 align:middle line:90%
We're happy.

00:12:48.448 --> 00:12:49.248 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:12:49.248 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
But I've never
forgotten that day,

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.460 align:middle line:84%
the day I had to
cope with the fact

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:84%
that I had to discover
for myself that I was

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.860 align:middle line:84%
a real human being and that
there were people out there who

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:84%
did love me, and that the most
important person who loved me

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:84%
was God working through myself,
and myself working through God.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.470 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So although it was a
very painful experience,

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:middle line:84%
in many ways I'm grateful to
it because I've never forgotten

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
ever since that no matter what
anyone says to me or does to me

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.600 align:middle line:84%
or thinks about me, I
am a real human being.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.850 align:middle line:90%
The universe invited me here.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And I have as much right
to be here as anybody

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.650 align:middle line:84%
else and as much right
to my contentment

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:90%
and happiness as anybody else.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm now grateful
to that woman

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:84%
who thought I was not good
enough to marry her daughter.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm a real human being, and
that is what I learned from her.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I am now very
grateful indeed to her

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.740 align:middle line:84%
because I do not
know any other way

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
I would have
learned that lesson.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Try not to look so grouchy.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I've told my children
the same thing,

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.350 align:middle line:84%
but whether they've
learned it or not,

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.217 align:middle line:84%
they will have to have
a crisis of their own

00:14:07.217 --> 00:14:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and then try and
remember where to go.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.780 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I work here at
the Omega Institute.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I first visited Omega
about 16 years ago

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and have only been working
here the last year and a half.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Sort of a cycle came
all around for me.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.910 align:middle line:84%
The first time I
was here was right

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.860 align:middle line:84%
after I'd had a near-death
experience which

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:90%
transformed my life.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And now my life has
completely unfolded

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
into one of being solidly
focused on spiritual path

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual work.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:84%
But 16 years ago,
I was completely

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:90%
at the end of my rope.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:84%
After being estranged
from my family,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.150 align:middle line:84%
struggling with dyslexia, which
was undiagnosed at the time,

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
trying to make it in New York
in theater at a very naive age.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Finding a woman who I fell
absolutely in love with,

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:84%
I managed to find myself sailing
with her to the Virgin Islands.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:84%
We wound up in a hurricane in
the middle of the open ocean,

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.570 align:middle line:90%
lost at sea for over a month.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.300 align:middle line:84%
The relationship
fell apart, then,

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
when we finally did
make it to land.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of all that I
just couldn't take it anymore,

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:90%
and I became suicidal.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think suicide
was something that was always

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:90%
on the back burner for me.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.370 align:middle line:84%
The question of am
I really supposed

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:90%
to be here in this life?

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Why is the hand that's dealt
me the one that I'm receiving?

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:90%
It just didn't seem to add up.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So I reached a point
where I finally,

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:84%
after struggling,
being disillusioned

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:84%
with the psychological
community,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.475 align:middle line:84%
I took matters
into my own hands.

00:15:51.475 --> 00:15:54.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Going into the
Atlantic City surf

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:84%
on a winter's day, deserted
beach, with enough sleeping

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:84%
pills and prescription
anti-anxiety drug

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:90%
to kill me alone.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I swam out as far as
I could out into the

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.370 align:middle line:84%
shore until finally I
was out of strength,

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:90%
couldn't move my muscles.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:90%
The cold water, the drugs.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing I saw was
a little boat on the horizon

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.730 align:middle line:84%
as I went unconscious
and went under the water.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was quite amazed to
find myself then awake again,

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
this time under my body, which
was now hanging lifelessly

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:90%
in the water.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.210 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I floated up past it
with strange disinterest.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:47.510 align:middle line:84%
But simply seeing it,
not necessarily saying,

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:51.890 align:middle line:84%
oh, there I am, because I was
amazed to find that I was now

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.510 align:middle line:90%
outside of that body.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And the I that is
me was with me.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw hanging in
the water, the end of all

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.230 align:middle line:84%
this trauma and drama,
was just a shell.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.960 align:middle line:90%
I floated up into the sky.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.670 align:middle line:84%
There was low
overhanging clouds.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And I turned and
looked back down

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.980 align:middle line:84%
to see this boat was now
searching frantically to try

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.099 align:middle line:90%
to find me under the water.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:24.589 align:middle line:84%
I looked at that again with
disinterested observation,

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:29.540 align:middle line:84%
but no attachment, turned
my perspective outward.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And as if something
from my chest

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
pulled me at amazing speeds like
a fly fisherman pulling back

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:84%
his line, I was just
wished out into space.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I was hurled into
space until finally I

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:84%
was at the foot of these
shimmering translucent robes

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
in a whole other
dimension, looking upward

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:55.810 align:middle line:84%
into the gaze of this wise
Native American shaman who

00:17:55.810 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:84%
gave me a real stern talking
to for having taken my life,

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:84%
assured me that there was
a mission and a purpose

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:84%
to my life, that I needed to
wake up to remembering it,

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.130 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to get on it
and move forward with it,

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:90%
that it wasn't just about me.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:84%
There were many other
people interconnected

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:90%
with this mission.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And from there he led
me into a black void

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:84%
where there was a sphere of
white rapidly approaching.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:90%
It enveloped me.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I found myself suspended in the
center of this orb of light.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.650 align:middle line:84%
There was the vision
of aspect of my life,

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:84%
not just my past and present and
future, but the impact my life

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:84%
had on everybody
I interacted with.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:84%
From this place of
seeing all this,

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:84%
my body, meanwhile,
was being infused

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:53.010 align:middle line:84%
with the most profound
love, forgiveness, healing.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And from there it was as if I
was launched out into the God's

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.210 align:middle line:90%
own internet, if you will.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:90%
From there I was resuscitated.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I'd been
pulled out of the water.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I was being given
mouth to mouth.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:84%
I was coughing up water, and
boom, I'm back in my body,

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:90%
but forever changed.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Immediately after the
near-death experience,

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
for about three days, there
was this profound awareness

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.900 align:middle line:84%
within my body that I was
a soul inhabiting my body.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But after about three
days that faded,

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:90%
and I became normal again.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So it took me a long
time to fully integrate.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And there was times
when I wondered

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:90%
had I ever been changed?

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Was this really real?

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.680 align:middle line:84%
But there was a simple guiding
principle that the voice of God

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
had spoken so
clearly to me, which

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.480 align:middle line:84%
was an answer to a prayer
I'd had as a child,

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:84%
wanting to change the
world as so many of us do,

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:84%
wanting to be of
service to the world.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:90%
And the message was simple.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:84%
If you want to heal the world,
first connect to yourself.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Really know yourself.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big job.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.120 align:middle line:84%
By connecting to yourself you
bring healing to yourself.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:84%
From there you connect
to your family.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I had estranged
myself from my family.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So I returned to my family
to make those connections.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:84%
From there, connect
to the community.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't part of any community.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I was anonymous
in New York City.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So I returned to my
hometown, my family,

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:84%
doing work in the community,
real service work.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you can
then make a connection

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
with your nation,
and from there you

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:90%
can affect healing the world.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately it's a spiral
that goes around and around

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and always returns you to a
deeper level of connecting

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:90%
to yourself, knowing yourself.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So I came to know
myself fairly well,

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:84%
got very involved in
my family and witnessed

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:84%
some amazing transformations
within my family dynamics.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:84%
I became very involved in
unity work in my community.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the call came, the
realization that the time was

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:90%
now to walk across the country.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:84%
That was my connecting
to the nation.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:84%
I walked from Ocean City,
Maryland to San Francisco,

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
California across Route 50
as a statement for unity,

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:84%
as a testimony to the oneness
that is true between all of us.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:84%
There is an
interconnectedness that

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
was so apparent in my
near-death experience that

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.230 align:middle line:90%
can be seen if only you look.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.120 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the amazing grace
that the song sings about.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the recognition
that we are all one,

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.866 align:middle line:90%
and we're in this together.

00:21:49.866 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of
all that, I was

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:57.570 align:middle line:84%
left feeling more deeply
aware of levels within myself

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:90%
that I was not yet aware of.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Healing the world starts
with healing yourself.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
This unity consciousness
is something that

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%
has to be held within first.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:20.220 align:middle line:84%
The message that love your
brother as you love yourself,

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:84%
or love others as
you love yourself,

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.200 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask yourself,
do you love yourself?

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Because many of us do,
in fact, love others

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:90%
as we love ourselves.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.050 align:middle line:84%
The truth is we
loathe ourselves.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So this simple process,
being able to lift myself up

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:84%
from the despair and the
confusions of any given moment

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:84%
back to that larger
picture perspective

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:84%
from the near-death
experience, combined

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
with this simple guidance of
connecting again and again,

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
is what has sustained
me and moved me forward

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.454 align:middle line:90%
for the last 16 years.

00:22:54.454 --> 00:22:56.698 align:middle line:90%
