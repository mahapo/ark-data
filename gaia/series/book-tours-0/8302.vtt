00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:10%
The world was fascinated
when the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.010 align:middle line:10%
were discovered in 1946.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Now what do they tell us?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Are there hidden messages there?

Wisdom Television
welcomes Gregg Braden,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.510 align:middle line:90%
author of "The Isaiah Effect."

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Greg turns to the Isaiah Scroll
as perhaps the most important

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead Sea Scrolls
to offer insight

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
into a powerful form
of ancient prayer.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to Wisdom
Television, Gregg.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Corinne, it's a joy and
a pleasure to be here with you.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It hasn't been that
long since you were here.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it hasn't.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And a lot has happened
since I was with you last.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You are a scholar of many
different ancient cultures

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and ancient writings, but
there are people out there--

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:84%
there may be one or two people
out there who don't know what

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
the Dead Sea Scrolls are,
and I'd like you to tell us.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, certainly.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.595 align:middle line:10%
And there are many
people that are just

00:01:09.595 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:10%
beginning to understand the
breadth of what these scrolls

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:10%
mean to us as well.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:84%
The Dead Sea Scrolls
are a library,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
an ancient library written by
a group of people we know today

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
as the Essenes, E-S-S-E-N-E-S.
We first hear of the Essenes

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.085 align:middle line:84%
about 500 years before
the time of Christ.

00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:84%
These texts are important
because for the first time when

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.430 align:middle line:84%
they were discovered in
1946, in many instances

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:84%
we saw some of the original
text that later became

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
our Western biblical
texts in a form

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:84%
that we had never
seen them before.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Much of the information
that we've always

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:84%
relied upon in the West for
this kind of information

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.080 align:middle line:84%
was edited in the
4th century AD.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.625 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen the
edited versions.

00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So it was with the
discovery of these scrolls

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.000 align:middle line:84%
in 1946, for the
first time we saw,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:84%
for example, the original
book of the book Genesis.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.550 align:middle line:84%
We saw excerpts of texts that
were edited, the Book of Mary,

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:84%
the gospel of the Book
of Mary, for example,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:90%
and the Book of Enoch--

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:84%
very key texts to help
us understand and flesh

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:84%
out the framework
that we already

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
have describing how we
relate to the cosmos and one

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.272 align:middle line:90%
another and the world around us.

00:02:16.272 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> How were they
discovered, Gregg?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a
fascinating story, Corinne.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.375 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those innocent,
some people call, accidents.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there
are no accidents.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:90%
It was a synchronicity.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
A Bedouin shepherd boy
was throwing stones

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:84%
into a cave, which apparently
he had done many times before.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:90%
One day, a stone hit something.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:90%
It sounded different.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And upon investigation,
it was discovered

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that that stone had
broken a vase that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.210 align:middle line:84%
contained some of the
most complete scrolls

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:84%
in what became Cave Number 1 of
the Dead Sea Scrolls library.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And between 1946 and 1959,
11 caves were discovered.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
25,000 fragments of
these texts comprising

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
about 800 the scrolls
were put together

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
from what was discovered
in these caves.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
They were relegated to a
team of eight scholars,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and those eight scholars
had the responsibility

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:84%
of piecing together
this information,

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.880 align:middle line:84%
transcribing it, and compiling
in a way that's useful to us

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>> How did it survive?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been to
that area of the world.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.222 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so hot there.

00:03:19.222 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Why did these-- the paper,
really, or the parchment--

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, some-- the Scrolls--
it's such an amazing body

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Some of these scrolls
are on papyrus

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:90%
like we find in Egypt today.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are on
animal hide, lamb skin.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were actually
written on copper.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:90%
They're metallic.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:84%
They're so brittle
that technologies

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
had to be developed
to even open them up.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
They had to be sawed
into strips so we

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:90%
could read what was in them.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Many of them were
stored in the vases that

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.010 align:middle line:84%
were sealed in with
resin and straw,

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.260 align:middle line:84%
effectively sealing out
moisture for over 2,000 years.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And this--

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, amazing.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The interesting
thing, Corinne--

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and many people believe these
are the oldest texts we have,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:90%
and that's not the case.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
We have many texts
and traditions

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that are much older than the
scrolls in Egypt, Babylonia,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.922 align:middle line:84%
Sumeria, cuneiform
tablets, et cetera.

00:04:04.922 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
The reason these
scrolls are so important

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
is because they are the oldest
record that we have today

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
written in a language
that we still use today,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:84%
in the Hebrew
language among some

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.157 align:middle line:90%
of the others that were found.

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why these scrolls
are so important because we

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.880 align:middle line:84%
know precisely what they're
saying rather than speculating

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.640 align:middle line:84%
about what a temple wall
or a forgotten language

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.560 align:middle line:90%
may perhaps be saying.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So the Aramaic language was
used as a form of Hebrew

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:84%
as well, ancient biblical
Hebrew, as well as Greek.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Some of the scrolls
are in Greek today.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:84%
We're just beginning
to understand--

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>> What do they say?

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're just beginning
to understand what--

00:04:41.983 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
when this information
was lost 1,700 years ago,

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
we began to lose
the understandings

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.822 align:middle line:84%
of our relationship
to one another

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:90%
in this Earth and the cosmos.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:84%
We began to feel very separate
from the world around us.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And in that
separateness, we have

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:84%
engineered this
marvelous technology

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.177 align:middle line:90%
that serves us so well today.

00:05:00.177 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:84%
We can have this taping,
and people see this

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.360 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
That's the result of a
path that has taken us

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:90%
through our left brain--

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
very logical,
engineering-oriented

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:90%
technologies which are valid.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:90%
However, they are incomplete.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And what we're finding is that
when these texts were edited,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
we lost another path that
is based in human feeling

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and human emotion what
our own science now

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:84%
is recognizing as an inner
technology of feeling

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:90%
and emotion.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is that when

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
we are able to elicit very
specific qualities of emotion

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:84%
within our bodies,
it affects our bodies

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:84%
in a predictable, repeatable
way, and now quantum science.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Our own modern 20th
century science

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:84%
is finding that effect extends
to the world around us,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk more about that
as we go through our interview.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>> You particularly-- you've
gone through all these Scrolls

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:84%
because you are a
scholar in this area,

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:84%
but you particularly
picked the Isaiah Scrolls.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Now when I went down to
look at the exhibit in Chicago

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead Sea Scrolls, there
was very little, if anything--

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I saw that exhibit as well.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>> --from the Isaiahs.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't anyone else
picking this up as something

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:90%
more important than the others?

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's very interesting.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.010 align:middle line:84%
The Isaiah text
was among the first

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
that were found in
the Cave Number 1,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
the day that Bedouin boy
walked into that cave.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The Isaiah text is the
only complete manuscript

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:84%
found in all of the
Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and it is on display today
in the Shrine of the Book

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Museum in Jerusalem.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:84%
It is unrolled so that
we may read this text

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and mount it on a
cylinder that is designed

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle line:84%
to retract into the
floor of this museum

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
into a steel and
concrete-reinforced vault

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
with steel doors that
close over it to protect it

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%
in the event of
a nuclear attack,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.315 align:middle line:84%
because it is believed
to be that precious.

00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have to ask ourselves,
what could possibly be

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:84%
in a 2,500-year-old text
that would be so precious

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that's designed in that way,
to be displayed in that way?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is why I
believe we're seeing

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
just the tip of the iceberg of
what Isaiah, the great prophet

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah, the first of the
Old Testament prophets

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.545 align:middle line:90%
was saying to us.

00:07:14.545 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And what we now know,
this information--

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:84%
this was written before our
biblical texts were compiled

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:90%
into what we see as a Bible.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:84%
This information
transcends, I believe,

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.060 align:middle line:84%
many of the religions and
scientific and mystical

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.020 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the essence up around
which many of those traditions

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
were later built. And by
going to the earlier text,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
we see in their completeness
and in their entirety

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
a message that was written and
left for all of humankind to--

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.512 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to
transcend the suffering

00:07:46.512 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps avert the greatest
tragedies ever to face

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:84%
humankind by evoking this
power that lives within us.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>> What do they say exactly?

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.860 align:middle line:90%
What does this text say?

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in very eloquent
terms, the ancient Essenes,

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:84%
they were poets as well as
scientists of their time.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And the only words
they knew, Corinne--

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.830 align:middle line:84%
this is what's so
interesting, that they

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:84%
were able to convey this in
the language of their time

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and 2,500 years later we're
still making sense of it.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:84%
In the words of their time,
so eloquently they say this.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:84%
That the world
around us is simply

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
a mirror of what we
have become from within.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:84%
That the love, compassion, the
understanding and forgiveness

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that we have become
within, we can fully

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
expect to see that mirrored
in the social conditions

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.240 align:middle line:84%
around us, as well as the
condition of our bodies

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and the anger and
the rage and the hate

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.708 align:middle line:84%
that we see in our
bodies, that we feel

00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of one another.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:84%
We can expect to
see that mirrored

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.890 align:middle line:84%
in the social
conditions as well.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And then it takes
us one step further.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah-- in his language, in the
eloquent language of his day--

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:90%
takes us one step further.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I
chose the Isaiah text,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.030 align:middle line:84%
because he says, "Not only
are these things possible.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I will show you how to do these
things," through what we now

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.550 align:middle line:84%
know is a modality of prayer
based in human feeling.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So prayer has no words,
no outer expression.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:90%
It was lost 1,700 years ago.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your question,
I chose the Isaiah text

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.980 align:middle line:90%
because of its completeness.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.285 align:middle line:84%
What we've done in "The
Isaiah Effect," the book

00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
"The Isaiah Effect,"
I could have

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
done in Buddhist traditions
or Islamic or Christian,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Jewish, Native
American traditions,

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:84%
because elements
of this wisdom are

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.857 align:middle line:84%
threads that weave
themselves throughout all

00:09:29.857 --> 00:09:30.690 align:middle line:90%
of these traditions.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:84%
However, in the
Isaiah text, I've

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.430 align:middle line:84%
found them to be the most
complete, number 1, and, number

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
2, in a language that
we still use today.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And that is powerful for us.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>> When you were talking, it
came to my mind a quote from "A

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Course in Miracles," which is
a spiritual channeled work.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And one of the quotes was,
"When you want only love,

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:90%
you will see nothing else."

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:04.980 align:middle line:10%
When we choose to become
the filters within that

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:10%
mirror our heart's desire
and our greatest wishes,

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:10%
it is through that
lens that we'll

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:10%
see the events of
the world around us.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And I believe Isaiah
was saying this to us.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.480 align:middle line:84%
This all sounds very
nebulous and philosophical.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened
is modern science now

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:84%
is finding the
same relationships

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:84%
that we can bear out under
laboratory conditions.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
We're talking to
Gregg Braden here

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.050 align:middle line:84%
about his magnificent
book, "The Isaiah Effect."

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to miss
anything about this at all.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.399 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:36.297 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:36.297 --> 00:10:38.229 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.229 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to Gregg Braden
about his wonderful book called

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:10%
"The Isaiah Effect, Decoding
the Lost Science of Prayer

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:10%
and Prophecy."

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
some prayer here.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.460 align:middle line:84%
You say there are different
modalities of prayer.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, Corinne.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:10%
As I was researching this text,
what I discovered is the prayer

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:10%
as it is seen by Western
prayer researchers--

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:10%
and there are people that
do this professionally--

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:10%
consider four modalities of
prayer in the West today.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.520 align:middle line:84%
They are colloquial or informal
prayers, meditative prayers.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:84%
There are prayers where we ask
informally for intervention

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:90%
in our own words.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:84%
These modes of
prayer are valuable,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:90%
and they have worked well.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And what we always
know is that there

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
are modes of prayer
referenced in ancient texts

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.115 align:middle line:84%
and traditions
that simply do not

00:11:30.115 --> 00:11:32.247 align:middle line:84%
fit into those
modalities of prayer.

00:11:32.247 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And the question that
researchers have asked

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:84%
is could there be a fifth
mode, a lost mode of prayer?

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It's through this text,
the Isaiah Scroll,

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
that I believe we have
found the evidence, the most

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.680 align:middle line:84%
complete, the most direct,
compelling evidence

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, indeed, there is
at least one additional mode

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:84%
of prayer, a mode
of prayer that has

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.690 align:middle line:90%
no words, no outer expression.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It's based in the
quality of human emotion

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:84%
that we know touches not
only our bodies within,

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
that regulates the
chemistry in our own bodies.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Now our own science is finding
it touches the world around us.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.150 align:middle line:84%
It has direct implications
in rocks, trees, plants,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and even weather
patterns is what we're

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:90%
beginning to understand now.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And my background in
the hard sciences,

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.380 align:middle line:90%
I have no preparation.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Nothing prepared
me to understand

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:18.990 align:middle line:90%
this kind of information.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's an outrageous
thing to say.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And our own science now
is validating and bearing

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:90%
out these relationships.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And they offer very empowering
possibilities to our families,

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.194 align:middle line:84%
our communities, our loved
ones in ways we're just

00:12:31.194 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:90%
beginning to understand.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, let's get
down to the nitty gritty.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Because somebody out
there is saying, "Look,

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:90%
this is all wonderful."

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.345 align:middle line:90%
>> What's he talking about?

00:12:37.345 --> 00:12:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> "But I was praying to win the
lottery, and I didn't get it,"

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
or, "I'm praying for my
son to get off drugs,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.900 align:middle line:90%
and he's still on drugs."

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>> --what do you
mean, this modality?

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.073 align:middle line:84%
When we are praying
for something, as well

00:12:52.073 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
as our intention
may be, those are

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.030 align:middle line:84%
considered to be prayers of
what are called supplication.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:84%
We feel powerless in
a situation and we

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:90%
ask for divine intervention.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.090 align:middle line:90%
Dear God--

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we say, "God, we
know you're very busy."

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>> "So here's the problem.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And just to save you a lot of
trouble, here's the answer.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Get it for me."

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is--

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Precisely.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> --the way we pray.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and therein
may be the problem.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Because we've given an answer
in an expectation of how we

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:90%
would like to see it resolved.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:84%
As well-intentioned as
those prayers may be,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.767 align:middle line:90%
what the ancients say to us--

00:13:19.767 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and this is subtle, and
it's very powerful--

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:84%
when we ask for
something to come

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.900 align:middle line:84%
to pass, what we're saying is,
in effect, it is not here now.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Dear God, please let there
be peace in this world.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.280 align:middle line:90%
We're saying it's not here now.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:90%
That is a thought-based process.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:84%
This mode of prayer invites
us to feel the feeling

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.980 align:middle line:84%
without any words of
what it feels like,

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.480 align:middle line:84%
as if our prayer were already
answered, as if the peace were

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.750 align:middle line:90%
already in our world.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to give an example
just to illustrate this.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:84%
It's an example of
an experience that

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
happened with me that
helped me to understand

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
with a Native American
friend of mine back

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.160 align:middle line:84%
in the early '90s, who invited
me in Northern New Mexico

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:84%
to join him in prayers
of rain, not for rain,

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:90%
during a time of drought.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I was not prepared
for what I saw.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Because he turned his back
to me in a very sacred place

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.223 align:middle line:84%
that he led me to, placed his
hands in a prayer position,

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:84%
closed his eyes
for a few moments.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
and said, "I'm hungry.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's go get a bite to eat."

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I thought we
were going to pray for rain."

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "No.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
If we pray for rain,
it could never happen."

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, "What did
I just see you do?"

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "When
I close my eyes,

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I felt the feeling
of what it feels

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:84%
like to stand with my feet
naked in the mud of our Pueblo

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
village because there's
been so much rain.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And that mud moves
between my toes.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And I smelled the
smell of what it

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:84%
smells like when the rain
falls from the earthen

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.600 align:middle line:90%
walls in the Pueblo.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And I felt what it feels like
to walk through fields of corn

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
so high because there's
been so much rain.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, my
prayer became a prayer

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:84%
of thanks and gratitude
for the opportunity

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:90%
to choose those things."

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So he felt those feelings
rather than asking

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.460 align:middle line:90%
that they come to pass.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long
story very brief,

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of rain that
happened right after that.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I cannot say scientifically that
his prayer had anything to do

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
with the rains and the snows
in Northern New Mexico the next

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:84%
We can say there's a
very high correlation

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:84%
because we've seen this mode
of prayer time and time again,

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Corinne.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Before the signing of the
peace treaties in Belfast,

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Northern Ireland, when the
language was a stumbling block,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
85 nations joined
together on the internet

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.430 align:middle line:90%
in this mode of prayer.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And the words were found,
and the peace treaty

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:90%
was signed three days early.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:90%
In the US, bombing--

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
NATO bombing air raids in
Iraq, where innocent civilians

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:90%
were going to be killed.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:84%
During what researchers
call the prayer window,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
the time the prayer
is occurring,

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.840 align:middle line:84%
85 nations coordinated
on the worldwide web,

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.123 align:middle line:84%
were in prayers of
peace, and that night all

00:15:45.123 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:90%
that could happen was peace.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Those warplanes turned around
and came back to their bases

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.425 align:middle line:90%
mid air.

00:15:50.425 --> 00:15:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It's been implicated
in the great fires

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:90%
of Southern Peru in '98.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.773 align:middle line:84%
The correlations
are so high, we must

00:15:55.773 --> 00:15:56.940 align:middle line:90%
say that there is an effect.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And that effect is
worth examining.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying is
don't ask God for something,

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:90%
but you do if you imagine--

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:90%
somehow you play let's pretend--

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:90%
that it's already here.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.887 align:middle line:84%
>> We feel the feeling
of what it feels like.

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is the key.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So many people in
our culture believe

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
that feeling an
emotion and thought

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:90%
are all one in the same.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And while they're related,
there are subtle differences.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.017 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of
the information that

00:16:22.017 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:84%
was lost 1,700 years
ago within each of us,

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.050 align:middle line:84%
requiring no special tools
and no special knowledge

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:84%
other than the
knowledge that's there.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
It is an internal
technology of power.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.730 align:middle line:84%
When we choose to
have feelings--

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and the best approximation that
researchers found are feelings

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:90%
of appreciation and gratitude--

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:84%
those feelings, those feelings
send signals from our heart

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.270 align:middle line:84%
to our brain that give
life-giving chemistry

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
to our bodies that is
digitally measurable.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:84%
DHEA levels increase over 100%
in a very brief period of time

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.330 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of
that appreciation.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that that effect
extends to the world around us.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Plants, leaves of trees
register these feelings,

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:84%
and we can measure this
with our own equipment.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.660 align:middle line:84%
There is a power, there's
a force that lives there.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the question
of our audiences.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Could there
be a power that

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
lives within us, that allows
us to heal our bodies,

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
bring a lasting
peace to our world,

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps avert the
greatest tragedies ever

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:90%
to face humankind?"

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.380 align:middle line:90%
And I believe the answer is yes.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
The key is that not only
can we do this alone,

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:84%
we have the opportunity
to join together

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:84%
as a family of humanity
through the miracles

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:84%
such as the worldwide
web in moments

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:84%
of prayer with no outer
expression, no words.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:84%
We are feeling the feeling,
and that's the language

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:84%
that the angels say that
we speak to God in creation

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>> So we don't pray for peace?

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:90%
We visualize peace.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.450 align:middle line:90%
The feeling of peace?

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>> The feeling of peace.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if peace
were already present

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.585 align:middle line:84%
in our communities, in our
families, in our world,

00:17:54.585 --> 00:17:55.960 align:middle line:84%
how would our
lives be different?

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:90%
What would that feel like?

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.500 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel like
to be able to walk down

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:05.502 align:middle line:84%
the street in the safety of
knowing that you are safe

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and you are in peace or walk
across the borders of a nation

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:84%
and look at the eyes of
our brothers and sisters

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and hold them in our arms
and know that we are that one

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:90%
and there is no threat among us?

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:90%
That's the feeling.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do we
help another person?

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Do we just don't pray for them?

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there's nothing wrong--

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.158 align:middle line:90%
and I'm clear I want to imply--

00:18:25.158 --> 00:18:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to imply there's
anything wrong with any prayers

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.063 align:middle line:90%
we've ever done.

00:18:29.063 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:84%
We've done the best
with the information

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.042 align:middle line:84%
that we've had from the
fragmented texts that

00:18:33.042 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:90%
were handed down to us.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Now that new texts
are being discovered,

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:84%
we're adding new tools
to our toolbox, perhaps

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:84%
more empowering
modalities of prayer that

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:90%
add to what we already know.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:84%
We're praying for someone
else, for illness or disease.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:84%
What we do is to feel
the feeling of what

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:84%
it's like to be with them
in the presence of a fully

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
enabled, fully empowered,
very vital person

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.370 align:middle line:84%
rather than asking that
their illness be healed.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.260 align:middle line:84%
A close family member
of mine has just

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:90%
gone through cancer surgery.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And during that surgery, rather
than saying, "Dear God"--

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Help my--

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --"please, please help," what
I was feeling was the feeling

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
of what it would be like
following that surgery

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:84%
to embrace that person in my
arms and to feel the vitality

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:84%
running through their
body and to feel them

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:90%
in their completeness.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And some very interesting
things happened.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:84%
This person bled less than a
teaspoonful during the surgery.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:84%
There was very little
internal bruising or swelling,

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and we have very good
evidence to demonstrate

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.060 align:middle line:84%
that this is the kind
of relationship we

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:90%
have with our world.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.828 align:middle line:84%
It's based in this language,
feeling as a language.

00:19:37.828 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And we may have forgotten
what that language says to us

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.370 align:middle line:90%
and how to use it.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So did you see
this person well?

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Or did you see yourself
experiencing the person well?

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I saw this person.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:53.813 align:middle line:84%
I saw myself experiencing the
person well, in your language.

00:19:53.813 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Let me give another example.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:84%
We have a very rare
piece of video footage

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:84%
from Beijing, China, a
medicine-less hospital

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:84%
where a woman has a 3 inch
diameter bladder cancer.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.620 align:middle line:90%
It's deemed inoperable.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I saw this.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And you have seen this.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:84%
In the presence of three other
people, three practitioners

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
trained in emotional
management, this woman

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:84%
has an ultrasound over
that part of her body

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
where the tumor is, so we can
see real-time what happens.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.190 align:middle line:84%
In 2 minutes and 40
seconds, while these people

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:84%
are feeling the
focus-concentrated feeling

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.430 align:middle line:84%
of what it feels like to be
in the presence of this woman

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
without any cancer
in real time--

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:84%
this isn't time-lapse-- we
see that tumor literally

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:90%
disappear before our eyes.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:84%
The body, her body responded
to the field effect

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:90%
of the heart and the feeling.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Our science is just beginning
to understand this relationship,

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:90%
and it is a science.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:90%
It is teachable.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.260 align:middle line:90%
It is predictable.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:84%
It's something
that we can learn.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.613 align:middle line:84%
We need no special
tools to do it.

00:20:50.613 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it empowers
us in ways that we're just

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.933 align:middle line:90%
beginning to understand.

00:20:54.933 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking of
helping each other,

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:90%
I'd love you to tell the story--

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:90%
we have about two minutes--

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:84%
of the Special Olympics story
at the end of your book.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.277 align:middle line:90%
I love that story.

00:21:03.277 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The Special Olympics story,
I saved for the end of the book

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.870 align:middle line:84%
because I believe it's a
metaphor for our lives.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:10%
Nine children trained together
for the Special Olympics,

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:16.270 align:middle line:10%
the team for children who,
because of whatever physical

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:10%
impairment, cannot participate
in their regularly scheduled

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.230 align:middle line:10%
Olympics.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.855 align:middle line:84%
They became very good
friends, and they

00:21:21.855 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
found themselves competing in
the same event on the same day

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:90%
against one another.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:90%
The starting gun went off.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And under whatever mode
of locomotion they had,

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.523 align:middle line:84%
they began to move to
the end of the track.

00:21:32.523 --> 00:21:34.690 align:middle line:84%
There was one boy with
Down's syndrome that stopped,

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.082 align:middle line:84%
and his thoughts moved
to his teammates.

00:21:37.082 --> 00:21:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And he looked around,
and he looked behind him.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.248 align:middle line:84%
And one of his teammates
had fallen and never made it

00:21:41.248 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:90%
past that finish line.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:90%
And he stopped.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.480 align:middle line:90%
And he began to walk back.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And one by one, every one of
the other children did as well.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And they walked to
the starting line.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.280 align:middle line:90%
They knelt down.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:90%
They picked this boy up.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.123 align:middle line:84%
Arm in arm, they walked
together toward that finish.

00:21:56.123 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it made no
sense for one of them

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.790 align:middle line:84%
to be there unless they
were all there together.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.588 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's a
metaphor for the way

00:22:01.588 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:84%
that we live our
lives in this world.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.990 align:middle line:84%
We're all on the same path,
whether we know it or not.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.480 align:middle line:90%
We're all going there together.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.703 align:middle line:84%
And we have the opportunity to
be present and to love in ways

00:22:10.703 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
that we're just
beginning to understand.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that prayer--

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
transcending religion
and science and mysticism

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and inner technology,
this prayer, I believe,

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:90%
is a birthright.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very
empowering technology

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that we will use in
the 21st century.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And it all came from
this Isaiah effect?

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:28.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this--

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:29.085 align:middle line:90%
>> The Isaiah--

00:22:29.085 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>> --is what it said here?

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The great Isaiah
Scroll, I believe,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:37.810 align:middle line:84%
for me was the clearest record
that transcends the sciences.

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:40.578 align:middle line:84%
It's talking to us about
physics and biology

00:22:40.578 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and mysticism in a way that we
can understand today and apply

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:43.720 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the book
is fascinating.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, thank you.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much for coming
back on Wisdom television,

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:90%
Gregg.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my pleasure.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
such a gracious host.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been talking to Gregg
Braden about his excellent

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:90%
book, "The Isaiah Effect."

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:56.985 align:middle line:84%
As I always tell
you around here,

00:22:56.985 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
we bring you the most important
new messengers in publishing

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:90%
today on this show.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.710 align:middle line:84%
These are people who care
about you, so keep going back.
