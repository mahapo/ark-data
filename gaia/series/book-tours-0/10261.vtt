00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.100 align:middle line:10%
>> This is Book Tours
and I'm Corinne Edwards.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.160 align:middle line:10%
I'd like you to meet one of the
most important new messengers

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.900 align:middle line:10%
in publishing today.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Important because the
authors on this show

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:84%
are dedicated to helping
your personal growth,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:84%
make you happier, healthier,
to be the best you can be.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:84%
We are delighted to welcome
George Kinder, author

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
of "The Seven Stages
of Money Maturity."

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:84%
They say money, money, money
makes the world go around,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.510 align:middle line:84%
but can we embrace
a spiritual life

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and still want to make
lots of that dirty stuff?

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.130 align:middle line:90%
George Kinder says yes.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:84%
George is an internationally
known financial planner,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:90%
and wait, a Buddhist teacher.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:84%
George, I have heard
people say, "I'd

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:84%
love to be spiritual but
I have to make a living."

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.465 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:11.465 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of it?

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think those are--

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:10%
that's probably the
most important split

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:10%
that we feel in America
today inside of ourselves.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I think about Thoreau
talking about us all living

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
lives of quiet desperation,
and I think that's part of it.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:84%
It's feeling that our spiritual
life is over here someplace,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:90%
and our money life is over here.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's really the reason
that I wrote the book

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:84%
because it strikes me that if
we feel that our money life is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
complex and difficult and dark,
and our spiritual life is just

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:90%
fine, there's a problem there.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Because money has to do
with how we are articulating

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:84%
our soul in the world, how
we are bringing our soul

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.150 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's very important
that we bring these two

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.560 align:middle line:84%
worlds together and have
a healthy relationship

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:90%
around money.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You are a very important
financial planner and I know

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:90%
that you address your peers.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.820 align:middle line:84%
1,000 financial
advisors at a time.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:09.988 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>> What did they say when you
say that it has to do with

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:90%
spirituality?

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you talk about that to them?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.835 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you say to them?

00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I say the same thing
that I just was saying here,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
basically, that as
a financial advisor,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:84%
you have a relationship with
someone sitting in your room.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And very often, what happens is
that they're sharing something

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
with you that they don't
share with their priest

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:84%
or with their counselor, they
don't share with other people.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's almost an issue
of taboo around money.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And you recognize as
a financial advisor

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
intimate going on in the room.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with it?

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:84%
If you move back and you
just go to stocks and bonds,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:84%
the person that
you're with is not

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:90%
going to feel connected with.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
They aren't going to feel that
the central purpose of money

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:84%
in their life is
being addressed.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And that central
purpose has to do

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
with what does
freedom mean to you,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and how can you accomplish
it in the world.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.427 align:middle line:84%
That's both a spiritual question
and a financial question.

00:03:12.427 --> 00:03:13.802 align:middle line:84%
>> What does
freedom mean to you?

00:03:13.802 --> 00:03:15.385 align:middle line:84%
>> What does
freedom mean to you?

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet people are so
inhibited about money,

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:84%
they say that people will talk
to you about their sex life

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
but they will never tell you
how much money they make.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I have a number of
psychologist friends

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.460 align:middle line:84%
who say it's absolutely
the last thing.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.727 align:middle line:84%
They'll talk about
terrible child abuse,

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
they'll talk about their
own personal relationship

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.083 align:middle line:84%
to violence, to
horrible situations,

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and they'll never
mentioned money.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Or a woman will never
tell you how much she weighs.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.391 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's the same thing.

00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the other thing.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right, yeah.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Never about money and
never how much she weighs.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The shame about that, the
problem with that really is

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that it means that
money is kind of hiding.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:84%
We're hiding our
lives around money.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence,
when we're not

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:84%
finding a way to
deal with it to make

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:90%
our lives whole and complete.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So always, the
spirit's over on one

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
side and money's over
on the other side.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a shame--

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>> --about money?

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Money, you know, there have
been all these surveys about

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
money and sex, showing that
the two most frequently thought

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.904 align:middle line:90%
of subjects.

00:04:16.904 --> 00:04:18.529 align:middle line:84%
But you know what,
we think about more,

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:84%
we think more about money
than we think about sex

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.370 align:middle line:90%
but we don't talk about it.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
people feel a sense

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.533 align:middle line:84%
of failure, a sense
of low self-esteem.

00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:84%
We read in the
Wall Street Journal

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
or in the daily paper
about how markets are

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:90%
making fortunes for everybody.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But most of us don't experience
that inside of ourselves

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:84%
or we experience how we've lost
money or we failed in business,

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
or we experience the
pain of a divorce

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and the financial
consequences of that.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
These are such
circumstances that if we

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:84%
don't talk about them, and
if we don't have someone

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.050 align:middle line:84%
that we can trust in relation to
the financial aspects of them,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:90%
we feel very low.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:84%
We feel a lack of
self-esteem and shame

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:90%
about our relationship to money.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.085 align:middle line:84%
>> In recent times, the
stock market has gone crazy.

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And people I talk to seem
to have so much shame that they

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:90%
didn't get in on it.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:17.374 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And then they have
terrible shame if they sold--

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yeah.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> --before it really
went up very high.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And then they have a lot of
shame especially if they sold

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and they lost money
because they panicked.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.065 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we get
over this shame?

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting, we
use money to measure.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a measuring
concept how much money we have

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:90%
or how much we lose.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And so we're constantly
measuring ourselves

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:90%
against money.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
important thing and what

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to teach
in the book is

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:84%
how to come to
terms with and feel

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with difficult
emotions around money.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:84%
That's really the secret,
is to learn comfortable

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:84%
not with the
circumstances but to be

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.640 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with feelings,
to feel at ease with anxiety,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.300 align:middle line:90%
to feel at ease with shame.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a practice, it's
a spiritual practice

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and a psychological
practice of basically

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
of letting our thoughts
go, letting the stories go

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to trap
us, and learning

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to really feel at
ease in our bodies

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.675 align:middle line:90%
around difficult feelings.

00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:30.032 align:middle line:90%
>> What is money maturity?

00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Money maturity
involves three things.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the
sense of ease or comfort

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.520 align:middle line:84%
in our feelings around
money so that those

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:90%
are no longer a problem.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.170 align:middle line:84%
The second piece of money
maturity is that we have--

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:84%
we know that money is
about our aspirations

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and about our freedom, and so
we connect our relationship

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.670 align:middle line:84%
with money to our deepest
places inside of ourselves,

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
what's most profound for
us to recognize and realize

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the third thing is to
create a financial plan that

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:84%
gets you from A to Z,
basically, that takes you

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
from where you are to that
image of freedom or happiness.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about freedom
and you talk about happiness

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:84%
but then this book is
not just a holy book.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.160 align:middle line:84%
This book is a very, very
basic and practical guide.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the startling
things that you say is,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.930 align:middle line:84%
in your chapter on knowledge,
is to write down how much money

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.640 align:middle line:90%
you need to live.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Nobody does that.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:90%
There are so many--

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.650 align:middle line:84%
we have so many emotional
responses to money

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:84%
that it's very
difficult for us to take

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.700 align:middle line:84%
on the practical
realities of it.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And we need to know how
much we need to live.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.030 align:middle line:84%
We need to know how much
we need to have in order

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.847 align:middle line:84%
to live the life
we want to live,

00:07:51.847 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:84%
in order to accomplish
what we need to accomplish.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So we need all these practical
things that we have to address.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What does it do for us to
know how much money it costs us

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:90%
to live?

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are scared to
death to write it down.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, for those people
who are overspending,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:84%
it confronts them with the
fact that they're never

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
going to find their
image of freedom

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.200 align:middle line:84%
because they're
constantly overspending.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's very important
to face money directly

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:84%
as it's important to face
any difficult life situation.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I know you started in the
book telling your story and you

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.250 align:middle line:84%
said that you had, even though
you were a mathematics genius

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like when you were a
kid and you knew that you had

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:90%
this ease with the figures--

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.909 align:middle line:84%
that you were very
loathe to make money.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I was.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I actually, in spite of being
very strong in mathematics

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and with money, I ended up
majoring in English Literature.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And I went out after college
and spent a couple of years

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:90%
doing spiritual practices.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So I felt it inside of
myself, this terrible split

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
between money and my
true self in some way.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that I didn't
want to go out and have

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:84%
to earn a living, but it
felt counterfeit in some way

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:84%
to what I really wanted
to do with my life.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's a painful
period in my life.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And it took me many years of
working as a tax accountant,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:84%
as a financial advisor to
come to terms with that,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:84%
to figure that, in fact, these
two paths of spiritual practice

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and of the financial
reality of life

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
are really one
and the same path.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Now when you talk to
these financial advisors,

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.645 align:middle line:84%
what do they say
to you afterwards?

00:09:35.645 --> 00:09:39.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Many of them have, in secret,
been feeling more closely

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:10%
aligned with a pastoral
counselor than with a broker

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:10%
in their lives because they do
have relationships with people.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And they are very disappointed,
they're plagued in a way

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:84%
by the complexities
that come in,

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
the complexities
of people's lives

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.613 align:middle line:84%
and how people
struggle around money.

00:09:59.613 --> 00:10:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And they want to know
how to solve that.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a way, you're
feeling of being torn--

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.672 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> --is how you combined your
practice with your financial

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:90%
advice?

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It's that you are a pastor
and financial advisor all

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I do both because
I'm a Buddhist teacher

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:90%
and a financial advisor.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's wonderful.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a very
popular subject, and let's

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:90%
say it right out loud, money.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:84%
We're talking to George Kinder
about his book, "The Seven

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:90%
Stages of Money Maturity".

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Stay with us, you will
recognize yourself here.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.302 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:10:39.302 --> 00:10:42.248 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:10:42.248 --> 00:10:44.212 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.212 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to
George Kinder here

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:10%
about a very popular
subject, money, and his book.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:10%
It's "The Seven Stages of
Money Maturity, Understanding

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:10%
the Spirit and Value
of Money in Your Life".

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, what about the
people, George?

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of us,
guilty, would say,

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:84%
"all my problem is you're going
to be solved anyway because I

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.845 align:middle line:90%
am going to win the lottery."

00:11:08.845 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Well.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.362 align:middle line:10%
It's something that I call
magical thinking in my book,

00:11:12.362 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:10%
and it's--

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.680 align:middle line:10%
I have seven stages and
the first of those stages

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:10%
is a stage I call
innocence, and it

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:10%
has to do with our belief
systems around money.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is a common
belief system,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:90%
more common than it should be.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is that if we buy

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:84%
into that kind of belief
system, it robs us

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:90%
of other energies inside of us.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:84%
It robs us, for
instance, of our vigor

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
so that we can pursue
what it is that we really

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:90%
want to accomplish in life.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.920 align:middle line:84%
So these belief
systems are things

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
that I teach how to be more
relaxed around so that we are

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.890 align:middle line:84%
not so attached to them, so that
we recognize them as just one

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:90%
possibility of many.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.385 align:middle line:84%
>> So we don't stop
buying lottery tickets?

00:11:55.385 --> 00:11:57.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I--

00:11:57.185 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you buy them?

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I did years ago,
but I don't anymore.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And the reason is
that saving and investing

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:84%
is a very powerful tool
for becoming frayed.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that if you
put $2,000 in an IRA

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:84%
but you destined it for your
daughter or your granddaughter

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.795 align:middle line:84%
when she is born, that at
the time of retirement,

00:12:22.795 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:84%
if you had invested that
money in the stock market,

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.045 align:middle line:84%
that money would be worth
between $1 and $2 million

00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:90%
for that child?

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So compounding at a stock
market rate of return is a very

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.380 align:middle line:90%
powerful way to become wealthy.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest problem I have
found with most people is--

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:90%
and the conversations I hear--

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:84%
is that when they get
any kind of a windfall,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:84%
they feel obligated to some
reason to spend it right away.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It comes in different ways.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Most for the most part, it's
because they feel deprived.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.590 align:middle line:90%
They felt deprived in some way.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
They've had visions or
fantasies of the perfect life

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:90%
and they've never had it.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And this happens not
merely with sudden wealth

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.974 align:middle line:84%
in terms of winning lottery,
but in terms of divorce.

00:13:11.974 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>> With people on commission.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.198 align:middle line:84%
People who work on
commission, they

00:13:14.198 --> 00:13:15.930 align:middle line:90%
get all of a sudden a big check.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.595 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't know where their
next check is coming from,

00:13:18.595 --> 00:13:20.930 align:middle line:90%
but they have this one, $10,000.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:90%
What can we buy?

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the other problem
with this, Corinne,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
is that they have no vision
of what their future might be.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
financial planning

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:84%
is something that looks at our
lives over time in relation

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:90%
to money.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And it takes our lives
seriously over time.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.850 align:middle line:90%
What do we want to accomplish?

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:84%
How much can we
give to the world?

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:90%
How much can we grow?

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:84%
How deeply profoundly can we
express ourselves over time?

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:84%
What happens is people are
so caught up in the moment

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and they feel so
deprived for not

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
having had this
money in the past,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:90%
that they spend it very quickly.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:84%
I see it with people who
come through divorces

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and feel devastated from the
divorce and feel very scared.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So their self-esteem is very
low and they can spend down

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.670 align:middle line:84%
whatever they've
received in a divorce

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:90%
in very short period of time.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think it's a
symptom of depression?

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that that's
part of it, yeah.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain despair
about not having money,

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
about not being wealthy
that people feel,

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:90%
and they can't stand it.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So when they get the
money, they don't want

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.927 align:middle line:90%
to delay their gratification.

00:14:26.927 --> 00:14:28.385 align:middle line:84%
They want to have
it all right now.

00:14:28.385 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think it's because
they feel that there's more

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:90%
money right around the corner?

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.442 align:middle line:84%
>> There may be some
fantasy in that regard,

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:84%
but I think they don't really
want to look at what's coming

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:90%
right around the corner.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Because if they did, they'd see
that the money is all going.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're going to
put some of it away anyway.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it OK to spend some?

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sure.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important to
spend some of those times.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a whole thing in
the new age community that says

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:84%
the reason you don't have money
is because you have not opened

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.590 align:middle line:90%
yourself to abundance.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.192 align:middle line:90%
You have not let it flow.

00:15:03.192 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that that's
another innocent notion.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's
true for some people

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and that's helpful
for some people.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:84%
But for many people, it's
just not appropriate.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Because our
relationship to money

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:84%
involves really knowing
what money is about,

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
thinking about our future,
saving, investing, planning.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.398 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of very
practical kind of earthy things

00:15:26.398 --> 00:15:27.815 align:middle line:84%
that have to be
done around money.

00:15:27.815 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they spiritual?

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think they
think that they are,

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that this is a
spiritual relationship to money.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the spirit
is part of our heart,

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's part of the
energy of our body,

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:90%
and it's part of our mind.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.610 align:middle line:84%
There are all of these
different forces that

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.220 align:middle line:84%
have to be engaged
with in relation

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:84%
to money and in
relation to the spirit.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not just a
simple pat phrase like money

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
it's about abundance or
money is about prosperity

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.950 align:middle line:90%
and just open to the flow.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I had a fellow who opened
to the flow like that.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.870 align:middle line:90%
That was his notion.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And he lived a wonderful
life for many years

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and then he discovered that
these heart palpitations

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:84%
that he had were in fact
symptoms of something much more

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.910 align:middle line:90%
serious.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And he had three daughters
who needed to be educated

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.483 align:middle line:84%
and had not saved
a dime in his life

00:16:14.483 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and he was concerned
about their legacy.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, that
whole world kind of

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
blew up for him as
he realized that he

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
needed to address
money, I think,

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.921 align:middle line:90%
in a much more adult way.

00:16:25.921 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So we don't trust
like Gandhi did.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't trust like
St. Francis of Assisi.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't trust like in the
Bible or lilies of the field.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I think that trust is a
lovely thing and I think that

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Francis of Assisi and Gandhi
were very mature around money.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a quality
of extraordinary depth

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:84%
to take a vow of
poverty as Francis did.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have this
image of having the flow

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.500 align:middle line:84%
but we don't really
look at what it means.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Francis did look
at what it meant

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and what the consequences of
that would mean for his life.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.925 align:middle line:84%
And he died a very
young man as well.

00:17:01.925 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Because he was broke?

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Because he didn't--

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I think, probably, he didn't
take care enough of his body.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.889 align:middle line:84%
He lived in very
poor circumstances.

00:17:10.889 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> What about people who go the
other extreme and they save,

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.690 align:middle line:84%
save, save, save, save toward
their retirement and live poor?

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's very
sad too, isn't it?

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:84%
Again, I think that
the important thing

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:27.900 align:middle line:84%
in money maturity is knowing
what freedom means for you.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not just saving
for retirement.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in that.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that money
is really about what

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:84%
is freedom, what is
happiness for us,

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and how can we use money
and the forces of the world

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish it.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the
question that really needs

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
to be addressed,
whether you save a lot

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
or you just are working
with money as a flow.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You know one
of the tips that--

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:84%
all through the
book, you give tips.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Very practical tips that
are not very spiritual.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Like it is not holy to pay
the IRS too much money.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.905 align:middle line:90%
Keep your receipts.

00:18:01.905 --> 00:18:02.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:02.705 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yes.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, every receipt
for $20, you say,

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:90%
is worth $5 to you.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Would you throw it away?

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yeah.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>> And we don't do that.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.520 align:middle line:84%
We say, "oh well,
that's not necessary."

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.620 align:middle line:84%
The cab driver went on a
business trip in Canberra

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.912 align:middle line:90%
and said, "you want a receipt?"

00:18:18.912 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:84%
"No, it's all right, it's
only $20, it's only $25."

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.770 align:middle line:90%
But you say be careful.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's--

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
one of my friends
calls that energy

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:84%
leakage that you can lose a
lot by not paying attention

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:90%
to these things.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Money requires attention just
as a garden requires attention.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It requires careful
weeding, it requires

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:84%
proper watering and one needs
to know the season of it.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So these practical tips like
paying attention to taxes

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and paying attention
to your investments

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and having an appropriate
relationship to savings

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:84%
are critical if you're going
to achieve the kind of life

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.295 align:middle line:90%
that you want to achieve.

00:18:57.295 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, the big thing
that strikes terror in all

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:84%
of our breasts is you say get
rid of the credit card debt.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, so--

00:19:08.192 --> 00:19:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we live without it?

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] Well, so many
people that I see that come

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
into my office have
an excess of debt.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence, they
don't have a very positive image

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:84%
of what their future
might be, of how

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
they might live their
life in a way that

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.820 align:middle line:84%
is giving all of their creative
resources to the world.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And so debt is a
curse on many of us.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:90%
How do we solve that curse?

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:84%
By addressing it, by looking
at it directly, dealing

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:84%
with the emotional
neediness that

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:90%
has brought us to that place.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And then creating a
practical plan for freedom

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.232 align:middle line:84%
so that we can live in
freedom instead of in debt.

00:19:49.232 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> As a financial planner,
you're dealing with people

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:84%
generally who have
a lot of money.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:84%
But there's somebody
out there who

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.207 align:middle line:84%
is living from
paycheck to paycheck,

00:20:00.207 --> 00:20:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and his wife is working,
and they have three kids,

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.030 align:middle line:84%
and the babysitter
didn't show up today.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, she's going to have
to take a cut this week.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:12.760 align:middle line:84%
If you could kind of sum up
all this type of planning,

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.150 align:middle line:84%
give them some guidelines,
what would you tell them to do?

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:20.890 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that the toughest
thing for a family like that is

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:10%
to save, is to have a
relationship to money where

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.260 align:middle line:10%
there's some saving and some
investing and some vision

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:10%
of a future that is positive.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about it,
it's only about $6 a day

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that is necessary
to be saved to be

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:90%
able to put it into a Roth IRA.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:90%
And as I--

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:38.925 align:middle line:90%
>> What's a Roth IRA?

00:20:38.925 --> 00:20:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>> A Roth IRA-- well,
any kind of IRA.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:90%
An IRA is a retirement vehicle.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah, I see.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't it?

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.685 align:middle line:90%
Retirement vehicle.

00:20:44.685 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can put $2,000 a
year into a retirement vehicle

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and if you were to invest
that in the stock market over

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.710 align:middle line:84%
the years, that money will
accumulate in a very powerful

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Again, someone who started
to save in their 20s

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and saved for just six years
in their 20s $2,000 a year,

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:84%
at the time that they're
65, if they'd invested

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.795 align:middle line:84%
that in the stock market,
they'd be worth $1.3 million.

00:21:08.795 --> 00:21:09.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:21:09.595 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Just from compounding.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's just $5 or $6 a
day is all that it is.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And what about
their credit card debt?

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:90%
What would you say to them?

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's more
important to pay off the credit

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.060 align:middle line:90%
card debt.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It's most important to pay
that off first because you're

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.850 align:middle line:84%
living out of balance with
what you're actually earning.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.775 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
that's going to curse you

00:21:30.775 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:90%
throughout your life.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.108 align:middle line:84%
If you're paying
all this interest,

00:21:33.108 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:84%
who needs to pay
interest in life?

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.920 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't buy you anything.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you can, instead of
having immediate gratification,

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:84%
can work with some
delayed gratification,

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.820 align:middle line:84%
you can in fact find a much
brighter future for you,

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.855 align:middle line:90%
your family.

00:21:46.855 --> 00:21:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are two things
that really stood out for me

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.510 align:middle line:90%
in your book.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.938 align:middle line:84%
The first one was sit
down and figure out

00:21:52.938 --> 00:21:54.730 align:middle line:84%
what it really cost
you to live because you

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:59.150 align:middle line:84%
don't know what you have to make
unless you see what you need.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And the second most important
thing is credit card debt.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Get out of it.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:03.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:22:03.522 --> 00:22:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> What about switching to all
these different credit cards

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.600 align:middle line:90%
that give you lesser interest.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And then you switch
to the next one.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.000 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
play those games.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of people--

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:90%
I think it's great.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.987 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
wonderful that people

00:22:12.987 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:84%
are doing that because
that's lessening the interest

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.100 align:middle line:90%
that they have to pay.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's important that
you do that not as a scheme

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:84%
to constantly be in credit
card debt but to pay it down

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and to begin to create a
habit of saving and investing

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
so that you can find the freedom
that you want in the world.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you're a very
practical spiritual man.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:38.800 align:middle line:90%
