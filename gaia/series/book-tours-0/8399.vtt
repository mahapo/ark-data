[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:14.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.130 align:middle line:10%
>> This is Book Tours,
and I'm Corinne Edwards.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:10%
I'd like you to meet one of
the most important messengers

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:10%
in publishing today.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Important because the
authors on this show

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.000 align:middle line:84%
are dedicated to
your personal growth,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
make you happier, healthier,
to be the best you can be.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Please welcome
Dr. Judith Orloff,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
author of "Dr. Judith Orloff's
Guide to Intuitive Healing".

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
When we are ill, can
our intuitive selves

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:90%
teach us how to heal?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Is our knowledge beyond science?

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And is it available
to all of us?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Judith Orloff, a
psychiatrist and intuitive

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:90%
says yes.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And she tells us how to do it in
her book, "Dr. Judith Orloff's

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Guide to Intuitive Healing".

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.505 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Wisdom Television.

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's wonderful
to be on your show.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what's important
to know here is that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:90%
you're a medical doctor.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.795 align:middle line:84%
I'm an MD, 14 years
of medical training.

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:16.595 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And a psychiatrist.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a psychiatrist and also
a practicing intuitive where I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:84%
combine intuition with all the
traditional skills I've learned

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.375 align:middle line:90%
in medicine.

00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you say that this
is not so strange anymore.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the most natural
thing in the world.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:10%
When you think of
it, a physician who's

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:10%
a healer, who's
able to intuit what

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:10%
goes on in their patients,
able to interpret dreams,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:10%
sent subtle energies,
ask for inner guidance,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:10%
use all kinds of intuitions
with all the hard science,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.670 align:middle line:10%
it's perfectly natural.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, one of the things
that fascinated me in your book

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
is you said that before you have
a new patient coming in, that

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
you literally get a
fix on their name.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, always.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I use a technique known
as remote viewing, which

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
is a form of intuitive reading
and tune into their names.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And what I do typically
if a patient calls me up

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle line:84%
on the phone, they'll leave
their name on my answering

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.539 align:middle line:84%
machine and then I'll
spend a few minutes tuning

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
into that name and I'll
hold the name very lightly

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
in my consciousness and see
whatever images, impressions,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.093 align:middle line:84%
sights, smells, sounds, knowings
come to me about the person

00:02:17.093 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'll get an overall
history of the patient

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
before they come in to see
me just based on my intuitive

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:90%
reading of their name.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.665 align:middle line:84%
>> How unusual is that
for a psychiatrist?

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] I think that part
is pretty unusual but I trained

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:84%
other people in health care to
incorporate intuition into what

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:90%
they do.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a technique
I teach everyone.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's learnable.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.487 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
should learn how

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
to do this type of intuitive
reading as children,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and that this should
be a natural skill.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
As human beings, we have no
idea our capacity to see.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And Western culture has
been totally stifled.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:84%
We're brought up to
revere the rational mind

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and to analyze and to create
and to really revere A plus B

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:84%
equals C, that
kinds of thinking.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But intuition and seeing
comes deep from the soul.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of our legacy as
human beings to activate this.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think what so many
adults are doing now

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:84%
is really craving this
intuitive sense of connection

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.363 align:middle line:84%
with the soul and the
kind of information that

00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:90%
could come through it.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And so many people want
to really develop this

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.995 align:middle line:84%
and to all those people,
I've dedicated my new book.

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Your experience started
being an intuitive.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:90%
You are a psychic child.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I was.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I had many premonitions
as a child.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in Beverly Hills and
I had two physician parents.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had 25
physicians in my family

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:84%
so there is a lot of
linear rational thinking

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:90%
in my heritage.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up making
predictions about deaths,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:90%
illnesses, earthquakes.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:84%
There was one time where
I predicted the suicide

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:90%
of my parents' friend.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And so by about age
11, I had made so many

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.890 align:middle line:90%
of these negative predictions.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
My parents forbade me to ever
talk about my premonitions

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:90%
again at home.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up thinking there
was something wrong with me,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.303 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to somehow
cause these events,

00:03:54.303 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:90%
I was able to predict.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.120 align:middle line:90%
It was so wrong.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Many misconceptions
that children have.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
But I grew up ashamed of
my intuitive abilities

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and my own healing
path has been learning

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:84%
how to integrate
intuition into my being

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and not to censor that voice
and to be large and incorporate

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.883 align:middle line:84%
linear thinking with
intuition, with being a woman,

00:04:12.883 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
with being a
psychiatrist, and not

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.170 align:middle line:84%
splitting off any aspects of
myself but being totally whole

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and totally embracing
my capacity to see

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and encouraging
others to do the same.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It's pretty unusual speaking
of how far this type of thing

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.408 align:middle line:84%
has come that the American
Psychiatric Association has

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:33.325 align:middle line:84%
asked you to be one of
the featured speakers--

00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> --at their convention.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's an amazing thing.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be speaking
about how intuition

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.483 align:middle line:90%
can enhance patient care.

00:04:39.483 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is wonderful
because it's

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
saying to me that traditional
psychiatry is beginning

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to open up to possibilities
of intuition, of spirituality,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.392 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
just negating it,

00:04:50.392 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and they're opening
their hearts to this.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.683 align:middle line:84%
And so many patients
are wanting this.

00:04:53.683 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:84%
What I'm seeing all
around the country

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.440 align:middle line:84%
is that patients
all over are wanting

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate
intuition spirituality

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.597 align:middle line:90%
into traditional therapy.

00:05:01.597 --> 00:05:02.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're longing for.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.472 align:middle line:84%
And I think traditional
psychiatry is

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:06.760 align:middle line:90%
beginning to respond to that.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to note for
the viewer here that this book

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.330 align:middle line:84%
is not written
for psychiatrists.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no, not at all.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>> This book is written for
the garden variety everyday

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:90%
person--

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>> --who is perhaps very
intuitive as say we all are.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Or not, or it's written
for someone who has never had

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.960 align:middle line:84%
an intuition in their life and
is interested in developing

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:84%
that or was never remember
to dream in their life and is

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:84%
curious about what would it be
like if I had a dream and what

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.010 align:middle line:90%
would my dream tell me.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with so many
people in my private practice

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.585 align:middle line:84%
as a psychiatrist who swear
they're not intuitive,

00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
who swear they haven't
been able to dream.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And every single
person I've been

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.140 align:middle line:84%
able to teach to tune
into their intuition.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.647 align:middle line:84%
But tuning into intuition is
one thing, that's the easy part.

00:05:51.647 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:84%
But getting people to
act on their intuition

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:90%
is another thing.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.313 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] >> That's harder.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>> But how should we
trust our intuition?

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I believe that we
must trust our intuition.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Intuition is that still
small voice inside of us

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that will tell us the
absolute truth about things.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And usually, in
Western culture, it's

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:90%
way beneath the rational mind.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:90%
And the mind will be blaring.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts, our
hopes, our dreams,

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:84%
our laundry list of
things to do, all of that

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:90%
is what is usually the loudest.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
But if we learn to
be quiet, we learn

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:84%
to go inside of
ourselves, and sense

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.735 align:middle line:84%
this quiet intuitive
voice inside,

00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:84%
it will tell us the
truth about things.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that we must.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:84%
In order to make truly informed
decisions about our lives,

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
we need to trust this intuitive
voice and let it guide us.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I equate it with our
higher self and I see it

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.545 align:middle line:84%
as a direct extension
with spirituality.

00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:41.975 align:middle line:84%
>> But how do you know it's
just not your crazy imagination?

00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] The crazy
imagination doesn't speak

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.970 align:middle line:90%
in intuitive terms.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.850 align:middle line:84%
The most authentic kinds
of intuitions that I found

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:84%
comes through either in a
very neutral sense where

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:90%
you ask a question.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, what
kind of treatment

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.060 align:middle line:84%
should I do for
my health problem?

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
What kind of treatment
would feel good in my body?

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the intuition comes
in a very neutral sense.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.435 align:middle line:84%
It's a very informational
sense or else

00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:84%
it comes through with
a compassionate tone.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, intuition will come
through with the most beautiful

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:90%
sense of compassion behind it.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And whenever there's
a lot of emotion

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:84%
with a so-called intuition,
I always question it.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Whenever an intuition has a
very high emotional charge,

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I will look inside of
myself and say, well, what

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:90%
in myself is being activated?

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:90%
And I will not trust it as much.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>> So if it feels impulsive--

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.145 align:middle line:84%
>> --would you stand
back a little bit?

00:07:31.145 --> 00:07:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If it feels impulsive--
but intuitions have a sense

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:84%
of rightness also that we
have to really begin to train

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to trust, it's
a sense of body rightness.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin
to develop intuition,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
you get a sense of this knowing
or rightness in the body.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Some people talk about it as
a gut feeling or that sense

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.228 align:middle line:90%
that all is well inside.

00:07:50.228 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that I teach
people to do in my workshops

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and in intuitive
healing is to learn

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:84%
how to really get inside
of themselves what

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.010 align:middle line:84%
an "intuitive yes" feels like
or what an "intuitive no"

00:07:59.010 --> 00:07:59.810 align:middle line:90%
feels like.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:90%
That's how the beginning.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you do that?

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The way to really do
this is to ask a question.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a pressing
question about your health.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.730 align:middle line:84%
What should I do about
this health problem?

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Should I choose chemotherapy?

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's say that's the question.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And just pose in a
yes or no format.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Then go inside, get
very quiet, and see

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
whatever images,
impressions, sights,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:84%
smells, sounds, knowings,
body sensations come to you.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And then begin to
really evaluate that.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:84%
For me, an intuitive yes feels
like a quickening of energy.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:90%
It feels like an excitement.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
It feels like my
body is actually

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:90%
pulled towards something.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense of
energy and enthusiasm.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if I tune
in and get a no,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:84%
it's as if I'm
hitting a brick wall.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:84%
There's no energy, a sinking
feeling or negativity.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:90%
So those are--

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're talking about
chemotherapy, don't you?

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>> There's so much fear here.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, there is.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you get the fear
out of the way so you can get

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.902 align:middle line:90%
in kind of a reading?

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I teach
people to do in the book,

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and this is essential, is to
learn how to breathe and to get

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
to a quiet place inside
underneath the fear.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And this does come
with practice.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Chemotherapy is a
big issue, but it's

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.010 align:middle line:84%
important to be able
to go inside whatever

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:90%
your question is.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:84%
You're asking about
a relationship,

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.660 align:middle line:84%
you're asking
about chemotherapy,

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
you're asking about
a career, you're

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:84%
asking about you have manic
depressive disorder, what

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:90%
to do about it?

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, these are big questions.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has big issues
inside of themselves

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and what's so important
about intuition is to learn

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.807 align:middle line:90%
how to find a neutral place.

00:09:27.807 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
I teach and I think

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:84%
that's an essential
skill for everyone

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.560 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to
breathe, breathe, breathe,

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.750 align:middle line:90%
go in and find yes.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Remember to breathe.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:90%
People forget to breathe.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:10%
And to go inside and
find that quiet place

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:10%
and ask to have the fear lifted.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.620 align:middle line:10%
When you go in, ask to be
able to find a neutral place

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.230 align:middle line:10%
and just have a sense deep in
the body of what's going on.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And this takes practice in order
to find this neutral place.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But what I found with people
who are making decisions

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:84%
about their health, they have to
have a body rightness about it

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:90%
before they go ahead.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.690 align:middle line:84%
To make any panic decisions
about health is a mistake

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen people
do that because doctors

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
tend to pressure
patients into decisions.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you go inside and
your body says yes, I

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.230 align:middle line:84%
might be scared of
chemotherapy but on some level,

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:90%
it really does feel right to me.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And then to trust
that and to go ahead.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a training process.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The trust part is the part
that's difficult, I think.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It is difficult. I went
through a lot of my life not

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.260 align:middle line:90%
trusting my intuitions.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Hold that thought for just
one minute because this is

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:90%
fascinating.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:84%
We're talking did after
Judith Orloff about her book

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
called "Dr. Judith Orloff's
Guide to Intuitive Healing".

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Stay with us, you don't want to
miss one second on this show.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.309 align:middle line:90%

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.640 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to
Dr. Judith Orloff

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:10%
about her book, "Dr. Judith
Orloff's Guide to Intuitive

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:10%
Healing".

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.470 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, great to be back.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> You said there are five
steps to physical, emotional,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.325 align:middle line:90%
and sexual wellness.

00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there are five steps
I go through in the book

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and these are essential
to intuitive healing.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:10%
The five steps are noticing
your beliefs about healing,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.050 align:middle line:10%
being in your body--

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:10%
>> All right, so let's stop
right there because as we ended

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:10%
the last segment--

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.615 align:middle line:84%
>> You said that you didn't
trust your intuitive feelings.

00:11:20.615 --> 00:11:23.345 align:middle line:84%
>> For many years,
I do now implicitly.

00:11:23.345 --> 00:11:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But I went through a
phase where I would even

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.375 align:middle line:84%
tune in and get intuitions and
I would see what they were,

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:84%
but yet I wouldn't
listen to them

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't like the
answers I was getting.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:90%
And this is very human.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:84%
When I work with
patients, this happens.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I could train them to get in
touch with their intuitions

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.400 align:middle line:90%
yet they don't follow them.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And what I found is that by
not listening to my intuitions,

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:90%
only bad things happened.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And by listening
to my intuitions,

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:90%
only good things happen.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.673 align:middle line:84%
So I think people
have to make a choice.

00:11:48.673 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it's really
a revolutionary decision

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
to make a life founded
on intuitions, to make

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.960 align:middle line:84%
a decision based on a dream, or
make a decision based on a gut

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:90%
feeling.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I went into medicine
based on a dream I had

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and the dream told
me in my early 20s

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:84%
that I was to become
a psychiatrist,

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:84%
to get my MD in order to have
the credentials to legitimize

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:90%
intuition and medicine.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:84%
It was a very clear dream
and it happened at a time

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.220 align:middle line:84%
when I had no intention
of going into medicine.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>> You were a hippie.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I was.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:90%
I was a hippie.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I was working in the tile
department in the main company

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:90%
in Los Angeles.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I was living with my
boyfriend in Venice Beach

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:23.780 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted to write.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.905 align:middle line:90%
I was always very artistic.

were home taking the gas pipe

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
of their brilliant daughter eh?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.180 align:middle line:84%
But I had this dream
at a time when I

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.430 align:middle line:90%
had no desire in my mind to go.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.972 align:middle line:84%
But I was trusting my
intuition enough at that point

00:12:36.972 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:90%
to at least give it a chance.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So I enrolled in one
course in a junior college

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.660 align:middle line:90%
just to see how it would go.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And one course
became two, became

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.440 align:middle line:90%
14 years of medical training.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
dream that propelled me

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.670 align:middle line:84%
through my medical
training and helped

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
me find my true
calling at a time

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.730 align:middle line:84%
when I had no idea
that's what it was.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm proposing
an intuitive feeling

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle line:84%
is that people make
decisions based on dreams,

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.400 align:middle line:84%
that people make decisions based
on the deepest gut feeling.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And to counter whatever popular
opinion against that that's

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
going on because people
in Western culture

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:90%
don't understand the concept.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
understand the concept

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
of making a decision based
on a revelatory dream.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.410 align:middle line:84%
The aboriginals
would understand it.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Dream time, they revere
more than waking time.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Or the Native Americans
would understand it.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:84%
They go on vision quest to
find their true calling,

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.300 align:middle line:84%
to find answers that
are deep within the body

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:90%
and in the soul.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm proposing.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what I believe that
intuition can bring us to,

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:90%
that deepest part of ourselves.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>> What about some of the
dreams you have that are really

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:90%
bizarre?

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a girlfriend who is
also a psychiatrist by the way,

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
she asked me to ask
you about her dream.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:84%
She had a dream
night before last

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:52.970 align:middle line:84%
that she was helping these
two huge animals birth--

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:90%
their offspring.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.000 align:middle line:90%
She said, "what does that mean?"

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.390 align:middle line:90%
That's like reading your book.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:84%
What would that mean to
you as a psychiatrist?

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>> That means she needs to get
out under the full moon and do

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.102 align:middle line:90%
some dancing.

00:14:06.102 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:90%
He does like to dance.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:14.060 align:middle line:84%
But out on the Earth and bring
her primal side forth more,

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:84%
because she's helping the
birth of this in herself.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's a true dream
telling her to do this

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle line:90%
and to not just stand her mind.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And to also bring that
sensibility with her patients.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
To not just stay in the
mind or the intellect.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:84%
To bring in that primal
sense of intuition

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.827 align:middle line:84%
and knowing and more wildness
in with their patients.

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And the dream of saying
that she wants to do that.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It works with children.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good, good.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Teach them.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So she should dance
more with the kids.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, dance, play, but tune
into the primal forces more.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> But when we had a bizarre
dreams, something like that,

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you, how
do you interpret it?

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>> No dream is bizarre to me.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Dreaming is my most potent form
of intuition, always has been,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:90%
since I've been a little girl.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And there is no dream
that isn't full of truth.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Every dream.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.252 align:middle line:84%
I just take on face
value, and I listen to.

00:14:59.252 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I have a patient who argues
with me a lot about that,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and she's constantly trying to
prove to me that dreams are not

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.603 align:middle line:90%
as truthful as I say.

00:15:05.603 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And one time she was
having a repetitive dream

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:90%
about broccoli.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:90%
And she says, you see?

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:90%
Now this dream means nothing.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And to me, if I had a
dream about broccoli,

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I would eat broccoli to
see if I felt better.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:90%
You see.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.162 align:middle line:84%
>> You would take
a lot of Vitamin C?

00:15:17.162 --> 00:15:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, no, I would,
because dreams can offer

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:90%
information about nutrition.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:84%
They can be very factual,
very down to Earth.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.892 align:middle line:90%
Or they can be very metaphoric.

00:15:25.892 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Learning how to
interpret dreams is

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.808 align:middle line:84%
something I go
through in the book,

00:15:28.808 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:90%
and it's really important.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.450 align:middle line:84%
As a beginner I always
suggest that people go out

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and buy "Man and His
Symbols" by Carl Jung.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:84%
That's a good beginner
about dream symbols.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be very careful
about defining dream symbols

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:84%
too carefully, because
what could mean something

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
to one person would be very
different than another.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.438 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give you an example.

00:15:46.438 --> 00:15:48.688 align:middle line:84%
There was one period where
I was going through my life

00:15:48.688 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:90%
where nothing was working out.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even get
the plumber to come.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't organize.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.482 align:middle line:90%
Everything was falling through.

00:15:53.482 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting
very frustrated

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:90%
and I was complaining a lot.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:90%
I was getting very ungrateful.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:84%
About that time, I
had a dream that I

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:90%
was diagnosed with leukemia.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream,
I was so terrified

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that my life was going
to be taken from me.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up in the
morning just so relieved

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that this wasn't the
reality in my waking life.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
All right, how did I know
that wasn't a psychic dream?

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I tuned
in and I asked myself,

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:90%
is this my future?

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And I went into look and
I got, definitely no.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:84%
What this dream
was, was a wake-up

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:84%
call for me to be
grateful about my life.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.543 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
compassionate way

00:16:25.543 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:84%
the universe could have
really, and the quickest way

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
that the universe could
have given that to me.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.170 align:middle line:90%
So I woke up.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
From that moment on, I was
totally grateful to be alive

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and my attitude
shifted at that moment.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So that was a
healing dream for me.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I had a patient
who very soon after

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:84%
had a dream that she was
going to get leukemia,

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:84%
only her dream was, that her
son was injecting cancer cells

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:90%
into her body in the hospital.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, the facts of her life were
that her son was a recovering

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.670 align:middle line:84%
alcoholic, actually
wasn't recovering,

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.855 align:middle line:84%
he was a active alcoholic
and he was living at home

00:16:56.855 --> 00:16:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and she was enabling
him and giving him money

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.140 align:middle line:90%
and he was abusive to her.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And she felt from
the dream that if she

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:84%
didn't make some
changes with her son,

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.483 align:middle line:84%
that she was at risk
for getting cancer.

00:17:06.483 --> 00:17:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>> He was killing her.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he was
killing her, basically.

00:17:09.025 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And from that dream,
she went to Al-Anon,

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:84%
she started making important
changes in her life,

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.972 align:middle line:84%
and she got the son
out of the house.

00:17:14.972 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:90%
And all of this.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And she feels that if she
didn't do that, that she

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:90%
was at risk for getting sick.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So these are two ways
that leukemia can come in

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:90%
for two different people.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm giving you this
as an example of not getting

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.683 align:middle line:84%
too fixated on a
meaning for a symbol,

00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:31.100 align:middle line:84%
because with each
person, you have

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:84%
to take the symbology according
to what they're going through

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.190 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, some of the dreams
we have a very embarrassing,

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:84%
because they're very
sexually-oriented.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Now what would that mean?

00:17:42.418 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I believe that there's
a deep yearning in our psyche

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to awaken our sexuality
and our erotic sense,

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:84%
and connect that with the
rest of our spirituality.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So the dreams that
come through, which

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.780 align:middle line:84%
are so-called embarrassing, are
really a welcome to awaken that

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:90%
part of ourselves.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So many people on the spiritual
path disregard sexuality.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
They stay in their hearts,
they develop the connection

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
with intuition, but
they don't bring

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.158 align:middle line:84%
about the energy of the
lower chakras in the body.

00:18:09.158 --> 00:18:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I wanted to
devote a third of "Intuitive

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Healing" to sexual wellness,
as so much a part of us being

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:84%
alive is being open
to our sexuality

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
as a reflection of
our spiritual energy.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
It's all one river
going up and down us.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And if we're open
to the total flow,

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:84%
then the vibrance of
health comes through.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things you
talk about is that sexuality is

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:90%
more than having intercourse.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Sexuality is an
awareness of your body.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's a sensual awareness.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, intuition is a sensual
awareness of the body.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It's about being open
to the body's signals.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:90%
It's about being in the body.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Being aware of sensual sexual
energy and everything else.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And so sexuality and
sensuality to me,

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:84%
means being in touch
with the erotic forces

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
as they flow through
us at any given moment.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's a function
of intuitive awakening,

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:84%
of being open to the subtle
energies in the erotic forces.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:10%
So even if someone is not in
a relationship for many years,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:10%
it's still very
possible to connect

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:10%
with that sense of the erotic
and deep sense of sexuality

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:10%
as it flows through you, just
as you walk down the street.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that
through meditation

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
as a way of activating
erotic energy.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Or opening up
intuition and getting

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:84%
connected with the
erotic forces of nature

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.130 align:middle line:84%
where sexuality flows through
nature into our own bodies.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I go into this in pretty
much great detail in the book.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you also do some
very practical things in that

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.160 align:middle line:84%
section about talking about
the differences between men

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:90%
and women.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, yes.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The hang-ups that men have
and the hang-ups that women

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Heard somebody say the other
day, if you're constantly

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.250 align:middle line:84%
asking your boyfriend or
your husband, am I fat,

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.202 align:middle line:90%
you probably are.

00:19:48.202 --> 00:19:49.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.350 align:middle line:90%
What are the differences?

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that
each of us, men and women,

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.080 align:middle line:84%
contain both the masculine
and the feminine within us.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And that men are not more
powerful than women and women

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.290 align:middle line:90%
are not more powerful than men.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And true power comes of
balancing both forces

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
within us, and not just going
into either the masculine

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:90%
or the feminine.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.360 align:middle line:84%
True power and the evolution
of men and women as I see it,

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.670 align:middle line:84%
is being able to balance
and embody both the feminine

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
in the masculine, and then
model that for children.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is the
whole new kind of sexuality.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And men I'm seeing
all over the country,

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:84%
are wanting to come
into their hearts more.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's very different than
just approaching sexuality

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.360 align:middle line:84%
from a mechanical point of view
or from just as a first chakra

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:90%
or sexual point of view.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.630 align:middle line:84%
The evolution, as I see it, is
combining the heart, sexuality

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and intuition together, so
that when you make love,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:90%
you can bring all that energy.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And with a partner, and
I know so many people

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:46.300 align:middle line:84%
are incorporating spirituality,
sexuality, intuition

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and every other sense
of the universe,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:90%
into their lovemaking.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Or their lovemaking just as
they walk into the street.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Lovemaking with the Earth,
lovemaking with the world.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
another human being.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of being in a
moment to moment basis.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
intuition can bring.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet there's a lot of
emphasis on being celibate

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.488 align:middle line:84%
if you're really
going to be spiritual.

00:21:07.488 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's only
in certain traditions.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think they're more and
more traditions that are

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.820 align:middle line:90%
teaching being in the world.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And certainly if you look at
the discipline of tantra, which

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
is a form of activating
spiritual and sexual energy,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:84%
it's about being all
of that in the world.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:84%
It's true, certain traditions
promote celibacy and just.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I see in the new age
community that people are

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.340 align:middle line:84%
always saying no,
I'm celibate now,

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm concentrating
on my spirituality.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And you just knock
that apart in this book.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:84%
You said that's, it's
all a part of everything.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it is.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say that that is
a choice for certain people.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And if that's where
they want to go,

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I totally respect that choice.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.973 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody is
interested about exploring

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:84%
all of the energies
while here on Earth,

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:84%
opening up to their intuition
and being in a world, sexuality

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.328 align:middle line:84%
is a way to really explore
everything in our bodies.

00:21:55.328 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are
interested in doing that.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:90%
They're curious about energies.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.382 align:middle line:90%
I am curious about everything.

00:22:00.382 --> 00:22:01.590 align:middle line:90%
And so part of my experience.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I can feel that.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of my spiritual
path is exploring sexuality,

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:84%
seeing how is
connected to the heart.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.307 align:middle line:90%
It's always the heart.

00:22:09.307 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:84%
The heart, the heart, the heart
is the center of the universe,

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:90%
the center of intuition.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I tune in, it's
always from the heart.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I explore sexuality,
it's always from the heart.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And the way I teach
intuition from this book

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.932 align:middle line:90%
is always from the heart.

00:22:21.932 --> 00:22:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And then from the heart, we
can explore our sexuality

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and it takes on so
many new dimensions

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.530 align:middle line:84%
than what we're traditionally
taught in Western culture.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a travesty what we're
taught about sexuality.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.057 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
women's magazines.

00:22:33.057 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:90%
You see surfaces.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:90%
You don't see any kind of depth.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And certainly from an
intuitive point of view,

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:84%
when you begin to see
energy and sense energy,

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:42.340 align:middle line:84%
you imagine all
the bright colors

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.215 align:middle line:84%
around everyone and all
the beautiful energy.

00:22:44.215 --> 00:22:45.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we want to
hear more about that.

00:22:45.923 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have to come back.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got so much
wonderful information to share.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking
to Dr. Judith Orloff

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.950 align:middle line:84%
about her wonderful
book, written for you.

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.575 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Dr. Judith Orloff's
Guide to Intuitive Healing."

00:23:01.575 --> 00:23:02.950 align:middle line:84%
As I always tell
you around here,

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.810 align:middle line:84%
we bring you the most important
new authors in publishing today

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:90%
on this show.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.200 align:middle line:84%
These are authors who
really care about you,

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:90%
so keep coming back.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:30.000 align:middle line:90%
