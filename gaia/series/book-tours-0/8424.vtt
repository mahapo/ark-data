00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it possible to really
have happiness in this life?

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:10%
Well, we have some
help for you if you

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:10%
think you'd like to try it.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:84%
We have Dr. Robert Thurman
who has written a book called

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:90%
"Inner Revolution--

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Life, Liberty, and the
Pursuit of Real Happiness."

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Thurman is a internationally
recognized scholar.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:84%
He's a professor at
Columbia University.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
He is an author and
he is a translator.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And he was the first
American to have ever been

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.700 align:middle line:90%
ordained as a Buddhist monk.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.743 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Wisdom."

00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you, Corinne.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.935 align:middle line:84%
It's very nice to be here
with you this morning.

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I think it's important
to start off by not thinking

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:84%
that everybody knows
what Buddhism is.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And, in particular,
who was Buddha?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think you're
right, Corinne.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:10%
Buddha was a prince trained--

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:10%
actually, he was like
a military cadet.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was a prince
trained to be a king.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And when he was 29, he decided
that there must be something

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
more to life than just
running his kingdom,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:84%
having fun with his wife--
and wives, actually,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:90%
in that ancient time--

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:90%
and then dying.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So he said I've
got to go and find

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:90%
the higher meaning to things.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Or if there is none,
then I'll find that out.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And he took a vacation
at the age of 29.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And after six years
of meditating,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:84%
he said, wow, I really have
understood what it's all about.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm really glad I did this.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very happy to
announce that all of you

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
can find out what it's all
about and that all of you

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.460 align:middle line:84%
can get away from this
sort of nagging anxiety

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and unpleasant time
that you're having.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can have real
happiness in this life

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.718 align:middle line:90%
and for all your future lives.

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
He made that kind
of an announcement.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:90%
He was so happy.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:84%
He was euphoric,
actually, he was so happy.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And then following
on that, Corinne,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
over the following 2,500
years in many countries,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:84%
many people decided to
make use of those methods

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:84%
to sort of get away from
the bad situation of feeling

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
separate from the universe,
feeling that you have

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
to fight with the
universe, and feeling

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:90%
that you're losing that fight.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And instead, they discovered
a way of becoming harmonious

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:84%
with the universe and
really feel successful,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
in a way, in your existence,
and attain nirvana, as they say,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:84%
the extinguishment
of this kind of

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:90%
unnecessary personal suffering.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:10%
And so many people were able
to do that that it became

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:10%
a very vastly popular movement.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And it has the kind of
the reputation, Corinne,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:84%
of being a religion
by Westerners.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:90%
We think of it as a religion.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
It sort of fits
in our categories.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.372 align:middle line:84%
And it can, to some
degree, be a religion.

00:03:00.372 --> 00:03:01.830 align:middle line:84%
But from the Buddha's
point of view

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and the major
teachers of Buddhism,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
it's thought of more as
a system of education,

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
how to reeducate yourself
not to have a miserable life

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and, instead, have a
pleasant and happy life.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can be a jew and be a
Buddhist or follow the Buddhist

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:90%
teachings?

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It depends on
how you define it.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:84%
The way I define it, the way
the Dalai Lama defines it, yes,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.072 align:middle line:84%
you can be a Jew and
you can be a Buddhist.

00:03:24.072 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:84%
The way someone
would define it who

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
would think of it
as a religion, where

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.917 align:middle line:84%
you have to have a certain
credo and so forth,

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:84%
then, no, you have to be
either a Jew or a Buddhist.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But even then, you can
use methods from Buddhism

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:90%
and be a better Jew.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Or a better Catholic.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Or a better Catholic,
or a better Muslim,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.310 align:middle line:84%
or a better Hindu,
whatever it might be--

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember a lot--

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Or a better
humanist, actually.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can be a
secular humanist in a way

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and use methods from Buddhism
about moral, meditational, and

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:84%
intellectual methods,
psychological methods,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and you can be better at
whatever it is you do.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, almost every book
that comes past my desk these

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:84%
days, it's either about Buddhism
or it is written by someone who

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
has learned something
from Buddhism.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:90%
What is happening?

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.209 align:middle line:84%
It's coming out of
the woodwork, I guess.

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
Arnold Toynbee said,

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.579 align:middle line:84%
Corinne, that the 20th
century in later--

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.008 align:middle line:84%
25th century historians looking
back at the 20th century,

00:04:24.008 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:84%
they would say that
the greatest thing that

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:84%
happened in the 20th century was
not the telephone, the TV, what

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
have you, it was the encounter
by the Western EuroAmerican

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
culture with Buddhism
from Asia that

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:84%
would be the greatest event
that would mark the succeeding

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:90%
number of centuries.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people might be
very paranoid about that idea,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:84%
particularly Christians, or
some orthodox Jews, in that they

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:84%
would think that, oh,
dear, that means we're all

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:84%
going to somehow supposed
to convert to this religion,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.047 align:middle line:84%
Which is why I think it's
very important to get away

00:04:56.047 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
from the idea that
it's just a religion.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean I teach about Buddhism
in a university in a department

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.230 align:middle line:84%
of religion, because
people are thinking

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:84%
that it was some sort
of belief system,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.370 align:middle line:84%
which is how
religion is defined,

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.703 align:middle line:90%
that is used in Asian countries.

00:05:09.703 --> 00:05:10.578 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:05:10.578 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So I teach the history
and what they do there.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
But really, I should be teaching
in a philosophy department,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.622 align:middle line:84%
or a psychology department,
or some sort of human science

00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
department really
rather than a religion.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Because really
what Buddhism is is

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:84%
the science of the human
mind, the human emotions,

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:27.930 align:middle line:90%
how they work.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:84%
It relates also to biology, to
medicine, to many other things.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:90%
And it really is a science.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason I think it's
becoming so well known now

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:84%
in America is that, I think,
we are a little discouraged

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:84%
with our own native
psychology, which really

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.260 align:middle line:84%
is very constrained by its
philosophy of materialism

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:90%
and really boils down to Prozac.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Take some sort of a chemical
that will alter your mood

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.883 align:middle line:84%
and that's supposed
to solve your problem.

00:05:52.883 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
The insurance
companies won't even

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.420 align:middle line:84%
pay for you to go and talk
to a therapist anymore,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:84%
because they've sort of
given up on people's having

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:90%
a soul and et cetera, you know?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So our psychology runs counter
to our moral and religious

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:90%
imperatives.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And the moral and religious ones
tell you you should be moral,

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
you should be kind, you
shouldn't be too selfish.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And the psychologist says
you should be selfish,

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.817 align:middle line:84%
you should have a big ego,
and you should run around

00:06:16.817 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:90%
to be aggressive.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And both of them seem
sort of too extreme.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of that,
Buddhism comes along.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us a
practical method

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
of how we can be less selfish,
and more moral, and more

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.270 align:middle line:84%
happy as a psychological
necessity, not just

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
as a sort of a way of
behaving, if you follow me.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we do that, Bob?

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the main thing
we have to do, Corinne,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the main thing that is the inner
revolution that I write about

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.840 align:middle line:84%
in my "Inner Revolution" book
is we have to turn around from

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:84%
being self-obsessed and
perceiving the world only from

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
our own perspective where we
think that everything revolves

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.610 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:90%
I should have everything.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And no one should
do anything to me.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't want this kind of thing.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.457 align:middle line:84%
And once I'm in
that frame of mind,

00:07:02.457 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
what the Buddha
discovered is once I'm

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:90%
in a frame of mind like that--

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:84%
which some people think is
only natural or inevitable that

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:90%
everyone automatically is--

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:84%
but he discovered that
that frame of mind

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:90%
leads to suffering inevitably.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe is not
going to be swallowed by me.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:84%
The universe is not going
to do what I want it to do.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when I think
it should, I'm

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
going to be always
in conflict with it.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
lose that conflict.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to die.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get sick.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Friends are going to leave me.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Enemies are going
to come up to me.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And so as long as I think that
it should revolve around me,

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be in
stress because I'm

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
going to be out of
touch with reality.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:84%
If I can shift
that over, not just

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.690 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of a kind
of an act of willpower,

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
but on the basis
of understanding

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
the salaciousness, the
erroneousness of thinking

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:84%
that I'm so special,
do you follow me?

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And realize it's not
that I don't exist

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.723 align:middle line:84%
or that I'm not
special, it's just

00:07:56.723 --> 00:07:58.640 align:middle line:84%
that I'm no more special
than everything else.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm interactive
with other things.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And I exist relatively and
relationally with other things.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.292 align:middle line:84%
When I really viscerally
understand that, Corinne,

00:08:06.292 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
you see suddenly my relationship
with everything completely

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And things are rewarding
to me and friendly to me.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And I can be happy with
them instead of in conflict

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow me?

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:84%
In other words, say
you and I, Corinne,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.740 align:middle line:90%
are two different people.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.520 align:middle line:10%
If I think somehow
my well-being depends

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:10%
on kind of suppressing you or
doing something against you,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:10%
you and I will be in
stress all the time.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.434 align:middle line:84%
But if I feel, well,
you and I are connected.

00:08:30.434 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:84%
And actually, if
you're in a good mood,

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:34.348 align:middle line:84%
and cheery, and happy,
that improves my mood.

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:84%
If you get something
out of whatever it is,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:90%
I get something out of it.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're more
exchanging like that,

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle line:84%
then I'm not in
conflict with you.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Then, in fact,
enhancing your situation

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:90%
enhances my situation.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>> But you go on at great length
in your book "Inner Revolution"

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:84%
about how people have to get
away from the community and get

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:84%
back to the individual and the
education of the individual.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.207 align:middle line:84%
That kind of runs counter
to what you're just saying.

00:08:58.207 --> 00:08:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very good.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:84%
In a way, it seems to at
first, you're correct.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But the reason being
that, normally,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:84%
in many, many
communities-- like, say,

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:84%
a communist society or
an ancient society that

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:84%
is what we call a
very collectivistic,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:84%
that is to say the
individual is meant

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.440 align:middle line:84%
to submerge their
self-interest in life

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:84%
very much under some
duties to the community.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Under that situation,
you see, the person

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.570 align:middle line:84%
is still really feeling
that they should

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:90%
be the center of the universe.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
suppressing that feeling

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and doing something for the
community under pressure.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And then that only adds to
their sense of unhappiness,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:90%
do you follow me?

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So why I say, ancient
Indian society

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:84%
based on Buddha's insight was
more individualistic, actually,

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:90%
than America or any place.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Because what it said
was human beings

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.450 align:middle line:84%
are such an amazing,
evolutionary phenomenon

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.070 align:middle line:84%
that they should
use that human life

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:84%
to come to a realistic
understanding of themselves.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:10%
And once they do, then they
can contribute far more

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle line:10%
to any community than they
possibly could being miserable,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:10%
and suppressed, and coerced.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.440 align:middle line:10%
So therefore, an
intelligent society

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:10%
releases its
individuals as much as

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:10%
possible to come to their
own self-understanding

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:10%
and fulfillment,
because it knows

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:10%
that once they're educated,
and once they really understand

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:10%
their relationship
with the universe,

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:10%
they will make so much greater
a contribution voluntarily

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:10%
and willingly to the
community than they ever

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:10%
would have as just a coerced
slave of some sort of community

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.910 align:middle line:10%
duty.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's the paradox
in there, Corinne.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.590 align:middle line:84%
First, you need to let the
person have plenty of room

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.550 align:middle line:90%
to discover their situation.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And once they do, then
you can count on the fact

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.162 align:middle line:84%
that they will be loving,
and friendly, and happy.

00:10:37.162 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:90%
And they'll do a lot for you.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow me?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:39.145 --> 00:10:40.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Whereas if you
try to force them--

00:10:40.687 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Hold that force.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Because they are forcing us
to close here for a minute.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been talking to Dr.
Robert Thurman who is a great

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:84%
scholar of Buddhism and a
great scholar in general.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:84%
He is the author of
"Inner Revolution."

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And we'd like you to
stay around to find out

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:90%
how you can get happy.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.489 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:11:00.489 --> 00:11:02.884 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:02.884 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.920 align:middle line:84%
We're talking to Dr.
Robert Thurman who

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:10%
is the author of "Inner
Revolution Life, Liberty,

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:10%
and the Pursuit of
Real Happiness."

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.210 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Corinne.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.495 align:middle line:90%
Very happy to be here.

00:11:20.495 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Bob, you know,
this all sounds very,

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:84%
very good what you're
saying, all this theory.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>> That's excellent.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> There's somebody out
here who's watching this.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And he's saying, "Yeah,
but what do I do tonight?"

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>> How can I take what you're
saying, you great scholar,

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
you great professor at
Columbia University,

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:84%
how do I apply it to the fact
that I'm in a 9 to 5 job.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I really don't like
the job too much.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:90%
My wife is mad.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:90%
My kids are flunking in school.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:90%
How do I use this?

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, one of the
things, Corinne,

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:10%
that I must say is that the
Buddha has a kind of bad rap

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.850 align:middle line:10%
in America because people think
that he thought life was yucky,

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:10%
life sucks.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.692 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's suffering.

00:12:09.692 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:90%
It's awful.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:84%
But actually, he didn't
say that just to be mean.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
In other words, no
one but a sadist

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.180 align:middle line:84%
would go out-- if they thought
really that life sucked,

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
they would go out and sort
of say, well, it does suck

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.915 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:12:23.915 --> 00:12:26.290 align:middle line:84%
The reason is that what he
meant to say-- what he did say

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.380 align:middle line:84%
was the unenlightened
life sucks.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.528 align:middle line:84%
If you insist on
being an egomaniac,

00:12:31.528 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a hell of a hard time,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:90%
basically, is what he's saying.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the world is not
going to agree with your ego.

00:12:38.398 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to, therefore, never

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.148 align:middle line:90%
have enough out of the world.

00:12:41.148 --> 00:12:43.720 align:middle line:90%
You'll never be satisfied.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
You'll be afraid other
people will come after you.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be defensive
and aggressive with them.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> But when I get the
right relationship,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.517 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be happy.

00:12:50.517 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:84%
You think that the other
person will make you happy?

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But then will they
ever satisfy you?

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Do these relationships
ever satisfy?

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:84%
When you yourself are
the victim of having

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
to have something outside of
yourself to make you happy,

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
then how long does
it last, you see?

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.657 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this is the
key insight of the Buddha.

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
It's your own inner state that
determines whether you're happy

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.040 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you are
a really loving person,

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:84%
then, it will be easy to
have the right relationship

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:84%
because other people
will really like you,

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:84%
because you'll be loving
and loving towards them.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:84%
If you are a person who
is very self-centered

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and you say, well, I want the
right person to make me happy,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.915 align:middle line:84%
everybody you try to find
will become disgusted with you

00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
very shortly, because
they don't want to just

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.352 align:middle line:90%
be there making you happy.

00:13:35.352 --> 00:13:37.310 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
someone to make them happy.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:90%
You follow me?

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, you'll
never get enough of each other

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:84%
if you're both in it for what is
the other one going to give me.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:90%
That isn't love.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.280 align:middle line:90%
That's possessiveness.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.020 align:middle line:90%
That's attachment.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So the key point here
is if you understand

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.150 align:middle line:84%
your interconnectedness
with the world,

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and if you understand that
your own state of mind

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.710 align:middle line:84%
is where real
happiness comes from

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.778 align:middle line:84%
or real suffering
comes from, then you

00:13:58.778 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:84%
go to work on your
own state of mind.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
If your kids are flunking, you
try to be more kind to them.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:90%
You try to help them study.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:84%
You sort of become content
with whatever it is.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
You affirm that you'd
love them nevertheless,

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:90%
no matter what they do.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:84%
You give them a
sense of support.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:84%
You don't scream and freak out
and intimidate them, et cetera.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you have
the sources of happiness,

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.920 align:middle line:84%
the wellsprings of happiness
in your own inner contentment,

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:84%
your own inner
self-sufficiency, so to speak,

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.560 align:middle line:84%
then the world won't
bother you that much.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
You can take whatever
it is and then

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:84%
you'll naturally be
such a cheerful person

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that you'll gravitate
towards more friendly people.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And you will actually
have better relationships.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But the key to it is, Corinne,
that the Buddha said, well,

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.410 align:middle line:84%
now I understand, it is
the self-centeredness,

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.760 align:middle line:84%
this self-preoccupation that
makes people discontented

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:90%
all the time and dissatisfied.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.687 align:middle line:84%
For example, Corinne,
you know that when

00:14:51.687 --> 00:14:53.890 align:middle line:84%
you've been having a good
time, when you're happy,

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:84%
what is that one surefire
way to be miserable?

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:90%
Stop to think how happy you are.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Oh, am I as happy
as I was yesterday?

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, could I be more happy?

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder how long
this is going to last.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> How long is it?

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Then, immediately, you're
miserable because you

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.698 align:middle line:90%
know it won't last that long.

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:08.500 align:middle line:90%
It could be better.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:90%
It has been better.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:84%
This relationship is it
great, as good as it could be?

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, maybe I should have a
relationship with another one

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:90%
and another one.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Divorce number one,
two, three, four, five,

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:84%
it goes on and on like that
because the self-seeking,

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:84%
the feeling that you must
be dependent on outer things

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
for your happiness is
an insatiable thing.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:84%
What Mick Jagger, you
can't get no satisfaction

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:84%
if you're just grabbing
for satisfaction.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.273 align:middle line:84%
If you have an inner
sense of contentment,

00:15:35.273 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
make the best of it,

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.490 align:middle line:84%
you see the half full
in the glass, then you

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:90%
you'll be happy no matter what.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And Buddha said even
you can pursue that--

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:84%
which is a commonsense
thing, which we all

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
know-- he gave us methods that
you can pursue to develop that

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
by developing a way of
getting free, breaking free

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:84%
from the inner voices
of discontentment,

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:84%
the inner voices of
self-preoccupation,

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:84%
by meditation and
by understanding.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
break through, you

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
can be so contented that you
can take almost anything.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Which, therefore,
ironically, enables

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.410 align:middle line:84%
you to choose the things that
are even externally good.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I was surprised.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I had never read in any
of these books before--

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>> --that you said that Buddha
really advised you to get rid

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.550 align:middle line:84%
of all negative
people in your life.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's helpful, yes.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.825 align:middle line:90%
You might as well.

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Never heard that before.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, when you say get
rid of, you have to remember--

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Avoid them.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, avoid them
for the time being.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And actually, once you get
really positive yourself,

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:84%
you can turn any negative
person into a positive person.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Like a mother has
a brat there who's

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:84%
having a tantrum,
who's pretty negative.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:90%
They're, like, wah.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Even though their own beloved
thing, but they're a brat.

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, a mother can work around
that mood of that brat.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
If she really loves
him, she can cheer

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.157 align:middle line:90%
him or her up and et cetera.

00:16:49.157 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon, they are like
being friendly and nice

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and they're not having
a tantrum anymore,

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.320 align:middle line:84%
without necessarily
giving them everything.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.445 align:middle line:84%
Just giving them what they
want for the tantrum is

00:16:57.445 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
no good, because then they'll
have a worse tantrum later.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:90%
In a way, it's weakening them.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.710 align:middle line:84%
It's making them dependent
on only getting that thing

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't teach them
how to control themselves.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you become very
positive, Corinne,

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:84%
when you're a very loving,
and cheerful, and positive,

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.786 align:middle line:84%
you can get to work around
even negative people.

00:17:13.786 --> 00:17:15.369 align:middle line:84%
And you can get rid
of negative people

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.994 align:middle line:84%
by not getting rid of them, just
getting rid of the negativity.

00:17:17.994 --> 00:17:19.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the best way.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in Buddhism
in the long run,

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:84%
because they have
this interesting

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:84%
view that we are infinitely
interconnected with each other.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
You and I, Corinne, have done
this TV show billions of times

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.410 align:middle line:90%
in trillions of former lives.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do it
again another million times

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.160 align:middle line:90%
in future lives.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, we'll never
get out of each other's face,

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:90%
in the Buddhist view.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we should try to
make the best of our interaction

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.220 align:middle line:84%
so that the next time
it's even better,

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:90%
the next time it's even better.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Instead, if I blow you
off or you blow me off,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:84%
then next life we come
back and we're mad as hell.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's much worse, you see.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So Buddhism has this gentle
nonviolent thing of feeling

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:84%
infinitely connected
with everybody.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, you kind
of make the best of them.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if
someone really drives you

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
up the war in the short run and
you can't cultivate yourself,

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:84%
because they make you so jumpy,
then it's better to avoid them.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Discretion is the
better part of valor.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism is really very
much commonsensical stuff,

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:84%
but enforced with scientific
psychological technology.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You know one of the things
that I thought was interesting

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
about your book is you have a
whole big section here on what

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.488 align:middle line:84%
you call a ideal
political platform.

00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right, Corinne.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It's my enlightenment party
platform for the year 2000.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think it
will ever happen?

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, of course, it will.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.650 align:middle line:84%
It might not this
planet, this year

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
2000, but maybe the next
planet, the next year 2000.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Sooner or later, it will happen.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.682 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what I
liked was the one part--

00:18:47.682 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
you have to pay taxes under
your political platform,

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.050 align:middle line:84%
but you get to choose
what your taxes support.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.725 align:middle line:84%
>> And you give the
government three choices.

00:18:56.725 --> 00:18:57.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:57.525 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I loved that.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that nice?

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a consensual tax system.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of like voting
for where it should go.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
You say I want it
to go for this.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Some people would want
to pay for defense.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Some people will want to
pay for schools and not

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.125 align:middle line:90%
for defense, et cetera.

00:19:11.125 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you give people
the sense that they're

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:84%
supporting what they want,
then you'll have more

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:90%
cheerful taxpayers, we hope.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And the fact that Buddhism
really does not support

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:84%
anything like
capital punishment.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>> No, Buddhism is nonviolent.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.423 align:middle line:90%
It's against violence.

00:19:26.423 --> 00:19:28.340 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean,
Corinne, that, for example,

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.510 align:middle line:84%
if some maniac is about
to kill your family

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and the only way
you can stop them--

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.980 align:middle line:84%
if you happen to have a
weapon-- is kill them.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Actually, although it's
a sin to kill them,

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and you shouldn't do it
with hatred in your heart,

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:84%
you should move energetically
and blow them away

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to save your family
in self-defense.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Capital punishment
is unpleasant,

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.540 align:middle line:84%
because you already
have them under arrest,

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:90%
under confinement.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And you could actually use
every educational method

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.800 align:middle line:84%
at that your
psychology knows to try

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:84%
to rehabilitate them and make
them genuinely repentant,

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and make them genuinely
kind, and make up for it

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.800 align:middle line:90%
to the world and all this.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when they're
in your power like that

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and they really can't
hurt another person,

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.502 align:middle line:84%
you then go and
vindictively kill them.

00:20:09.502 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what Buddhism
really doesn't

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.335 align:middle line:84%
like about that,
because in a way

00:20:12.335 --> 00:20:15.652 align:middle line:84%
it kind of encourages the
killer attitude because it says,

00:20:15.652 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
if you have the
power over somebody

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.567 align:middle line:84%
and you can kill them, well,
you might as well, you see.

00:20:19.567 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Buddhism really
objected to capital punishment.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And also the prison reforms
that are not being utilized.

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Our prisons are too much based
on punishing people rather than

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.890 align:middle line:84%
rehabilitating them,
although we have

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.600 align:middle line:90%
the theory of rehabilitation.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.228 align:middle line:84%
But in Buddhism,
2,000 years ago,

00:20:37.228 --> 00:20:39.520 align:middle line:84%
in certain kingdoms where
they listened to the Buddhist

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.470 align:middle line:84%
teachers, they banned
capital punishment

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.840 align:middle line:84%
and they had a
rehabilitated prison system.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And they had the idea
that every prisoner

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:84%
should be treated
like a wayward child

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, made to
be reeducated and grow up

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.123 align:middle line:84%
in a proper way rather
than being killed off.

00:20:53.123 --> 00:20:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
very, very important.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Actually, if I had my way,
Corinne, Columbia University

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.540 align:middle line:84%
or any university
would have a branch

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
where the faculty would
teach one course a year

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.483 align:middle line:84%
to some maximum
security prisoners.

00:21:06.483 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So that anybody
who went to prison

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:84%
would be forced to be
educated more and more.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:10%
And all of the junior
professors, all community

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:10%
colleges, would be
built next to prisons.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:10%
And that there would be a
major emphasis on reeducating

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:10%
as many prisoners as possible.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I know for a fact from
prison psychologists,

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:84%
I've studied it a little
bit, the one thing that

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.522 align:middle line:84%
lowers the recidivism rate
of prisoners who are released

00:21:27.522 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and then commit more
crimes and come back

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:84%
is if there's some sort
of educational program

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.700 align:middle line:84%
in that prison where
they gain a trade.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.570 align:middle line:90%
They gain knowledge.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.860 align:middle line:90%
They learn some skill.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:90%
They read, et cetera.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.090 align:middle line:84%
It's gaining a sense of control
over their own minds and lives

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.850 align:middle line:84%
through being educated is the
one thing that saves people

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:90%
from a life of crime.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're very short-sighted
nowadays because of demagogic

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.850 align:middle line:84%
politicians who say
like these commercials--

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Lock them up.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>> --where they slam
prison doors and stuff.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And they act like that
solved the problem.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, it costs
us $60,000 a year

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.860 align:middle line:84%
to keep someone
locked up in a prison,

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
twice the tuition at
Harvard or Columbia.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> When are you going
to run for office?

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, not for
a while, Corinne,

00:22:06.733 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think they're
ready for a Buddhist studies

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:90%
professor.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But I'd be happy
if Ross Perot would

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:17.427 align:middle line:84%
like to bankroll me and give me
a platform to explain my ideas.

00:22:17.427 --> 00:22:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Then at least if I could
be a good influence

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
on Al Gore or the young
Bush, the new Bush, whoever

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.182 align:middle line:84%
is going to run,
whoever might win,

00:22:24.182 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
then I'd be happy to
have that influence.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things, I think, I feel,

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that holds our
politicians back is

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.828 align:middle line:84%
that the public is kind of
too complacent and apathetic.

00:22:34.828 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And the public has this
attitude that they're all

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
going to do nothing
worthwhile, a,

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and, b, that there's nothing you
can do about almost anything.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very negative
attitude that causes us--

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
in the past, when America
has succeeded well

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and things is when we've had
the attitude that we can succeed

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:90%
and then we have.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:22:53.108 --> 00:22:54.400 align:middle line:90%
I'll vote for you when you run.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Corinne.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.630 align:middle line:90%
I'll let you know if I run.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> We have had a wonderful
time today talking to Dr.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Robert Thurman about
lots of things,

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:07.840 align:middle line:84%
but mostly about his book
"Inner Revolution Life, Liberty,

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.785 align:middle line:84%
and the Pursuit of
Real Happiness."

00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:11.160 align:middle line:84%
As I always tell
you around here,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
we bring you miracles
on this show.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Keep coming back.
