00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:10%
>> This is Book Tours,
and I'm Corinne Edwards.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.530 align:middle line:10%
I'd like you to meet one of
the most important messengers

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.530 align:middle line:10%
in publishing today,
important because the authors

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.550 align:middle line:10%
on this show are dedicated to
your personal growth, to make

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:10%
you happier, healthier,
to be the best you can be,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Andrew Weil, author of
"Eating Well for Optimum

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:10%
Health."

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:84%
There are many books on diets
out there, and many of us

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:90%
have tried them all.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:90%
What works?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
On the low carb diets, even a
green pepper becomes an enemy.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm confused.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:84%
But Dr. Andrew Weil,
the renowned author

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:84%
of "Eating Well
for Optimum Health"

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:90%
is here to help us today.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Andrew, what about
all these new diets?

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's crazier out
there than I ever remember

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:90%
in my lifetime.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.950 align:middle line:90%
People are really confused.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:10%
I think most of these diets
I would consider extreme.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.410 align:middle line:84%
They're asking us to make
drastic rearrangements of fat,

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:90%
carbohydrate, and protein.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's wise.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And certainly not wise as a
long-term eating strategy,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:84%
although, many of them will
work as short-term crash diets.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I sat next to a lady in
the beauty shop yesterday,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and I remember her
from maybe a year ago.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:84%
She has lost 100 pounds
on the Atkins diet.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, great, now it's a
problem she's got is how is she

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.085 align:middle line:84%
going to transition off of
this onto a way of eating

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that's going to work for
long-term health because I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:84%
don't think following an Atkins
diet is good for the long-term

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:90%
health of your kidneys or liver.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So if she goes off it, she's
going to regain all the weight,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and she can't stay
on this long term.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:90%
So that's the dilemma.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>> She says she can.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because eating
that much protein is really

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:84%
unhealthy for your
liver and kidneys.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And also, people on this diet
are often very unconscious

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.490 align:middle line:84%
about the kind and amount
of fat that they eat.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's
over the long term,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
this is not a good way to
maintain physical health

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.115 align:middle line:90%
or mental well-being.

00:02:14.115 --> 00:02:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, what about the
fact that they're saying now

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.845 align:middle line:84%
that some people are actually
allergic to carbohydrates?

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think
that's the right term.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I think there is
carbohydrate sensitivity,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and maybe 25% to 30% of the
population is in that category.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.210 align:middle line:84%
If you're carbohydrate
sensitive,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.627 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
means you never

00:02:30.627 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
eat carbohydrate or the
carbohydrate is the enemy.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I do think it means you
need to pay attention

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.630 align:middle line:84%
to the differences in different
kinds of carbohydrates,

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:84%
that, for example, that
pasta is better than bread

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.540 align:middle line:84%
because it's digested more
slowly, that you can reduce

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.170 align:middle line:84%
the impact of pasta even more
by cooking it really al dente so

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that it's chewy and
firm, that there's

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
a big difference between dense,
dark, chewy, grainy peasant

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:90%
bread and white, fluffy bread.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are
differences in carbohydrates.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>> So what happens like--

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
you talk about whole wheat
bread against white bread.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, you say
never put it in your mouth.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the problem is that
most whole wheat bread is

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
indistinguishable from white
bread in terms of its impact

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.525 align:middle line:84%
on blood sugar because, even
though the grains are whole,

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
they've been milled into
these very fine particles.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the main determinant
of how fast it's digested.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
difference, as I said,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
the old-fashioned, peasant
bread in which was actually

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
cracked grains, it's course,
that has a much, much less

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
of an impact on blood
sugar and insulin levels

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and even carbohydrate
sensitive people

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:90%
can eat it in moderation.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What about what about the
fact that they're now saying,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.297 align:middle line:84%
on these diets, now let's
throw the zone-- in there.

00:03:39.297 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, good.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You can throw
Pritikin in there?

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:84%
What about-- they're
saying now, for example,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Pritikin says fruits and
vegetables, almost no protein,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:90%
and almost no carbs.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The Pritikin good diet is
one of these ultra low fat diets

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:90%
along with Ornish.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
problem of those diets

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all, is you
get fat so low, food really

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.023 align:middle line:90%
becomes uninteresting.

00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think most of us aren't
going to stay on those diets

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
unless there's a very
strong medical motivation.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.030 align:middle line:84%
But another problem is
that these very low fat

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.440 align:middle line:84%
diets worsen deficiency
of omega-3 fatty acids,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
the ones in fish and nuts
and some soy products.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.720 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have
these, and most of us

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:90%
are deficient in them.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're
in greater danger

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.070 align:middle line:90%
on these very low fat diets.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the crazy ideas I hear
from the low carbohydrate diet

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:84%
is that you shouldn't eat
carrots or beets because these

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.360 align:middle line:90%
are supposed to have too much--

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Green pepper.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Sugar in it--
or green pepper.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.073 align:middle line:84%
In order to eat enough carrots
to disturb blood sugar,

00:04:37.073 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to eat
probably 1 pound

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 at a single sitting.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>> A real rabbit.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Hard to tell people
not the carrots

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
is silly because carrots
are full of compounds

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that protect us against
cancer, that are really

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.780 align:middle line:90%
good for long-term health.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:84%
So I think that these writers
have pieces of the truth,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.620 align:middle line:90%
but then it's distorted.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, let's go to
some of the other theories.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
well-known nutritionist

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
I heard about who said, what the
secret of balancing your blood

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
sugar so that you don't
have this rush of insulin

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:90%
is to not mix things.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Like, you should put protein
with vegetables and carbs--

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.595 align:middle line:90%
and not eat carbs.

00:05:18.595 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I have heard this.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:90%
I've read this theory.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I think this business
of food combining

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:90%
is a very individual matter.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Some combinations don't
agree with some people.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
general rules.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Protein and carbohydrate
are naturally

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:84%
mixed in beans and
grains, which have

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:84%
sustained life in
a lot of cultures

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:90%
throughout a lot of history.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's any
mystery why Americans are fat.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Americans are fat because
they eat too much,

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.663 align:middle line:84%
and they eat too much of
the wrong kinds of foods,

00:05:43.663 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
so they don't get
enough activity.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:90%
They eat too much in two ways.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
They eat portions
that are too big,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:90%
and they eat too frequently.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think these trends have
increased in my lifetime.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, nobody
was eating Big Gulps

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
of soft drinks and
buckets of popcorn

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.622 align:middle line:84%
in movie theaters and
oversized muffins.

00:06:02.622 --> 00:06:04.080 align:middle line:84%
People from other
cultures who come

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
to our restaurants, their eyes
bug out at the size of portions

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And they get right
into it because when

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.862 align:middle line:84%
you put that quantity of
food in front of people,

00:06:10.862 --> 00:06:11.827 align:middle line:90%
they go for it.

00:06:11.827 --> 00:06:13.410 align:middle line:84%
But I think all this
has gotten worse.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of inactivity,
I think major factors here

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:84%
are television, computers,
video games, which

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:84%
have sucked more and
more young people

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
into sedentary lifestyles,
and automobiles, which I think

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.783 align:middle line:90%
have really sabotaged walking.

00:06:28.783 --> 00:06:30.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think I don't
think you need a book

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.877 align:middle line:90%
to figure out why we're fat.

00:06:31.877 --> 00:06:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And I also don't think you
need a book or a theory

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.377 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what
to do about it.

00:06:35.377 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:84%
You want to eat less, and you
want to increase activity.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And you also want to eat
the right kinds of foods.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I think that this new
information about carbohydrates

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
is very important because not
all carbohydrates are equal,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and some people are very
sensitive to the weight gaining

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:84%
effects of refined
carbohydrates.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>> While I had you on this show
about a year and a half ago.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:90%
You're much slimmer now.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.547 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, first of all--

00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> You weren't fat before.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>> My body type is--

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:90%
I have this kind of body type.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I am never going to
be svelte and skinny.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
important for people

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
to realize that body type
is genetically determined.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't think we can
control our height,

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have much more
power to control our body type.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And your body wants to
be at a certain weight.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I think we're made
crazy in this culture

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:84%
by being bombarded with all
these messages from the fashion

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and entertainment industries
about an ideal body type that's

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:90%
an impossibility for most of us.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I work to keep myself in good
shape by being very active.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.030 align:middle line:84%
When I'm home, I either
walk every day, I swim, or I

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
bicycle, or some
combination of all of that,

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:90%
and I get daily activity.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:90%
And I also watch what I eat.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I have found that, for
myself, that just cutting out

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:84%
bread or cutting down on bread
has been a great strategy

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:90%
for controlling my weight.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's worth remembering
that we could as easily have

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:84%
been born into a
culture or a time

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:84%
where skinny people were
thought to be sexually

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:90%
unattractive and unhealthy.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can't stand
skinny men myself.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I like a man with a
little bit of heft to him.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:90%
But women particularly, Andrew.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:90%
I am aware.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:90%
I am aware.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But I think this
is very damaging

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
because most people can't
attain this kind of ideal that's

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:90%
put out there.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I also think that, if
you're not morbidly obese--

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and we all know morbid
obesity when we see it.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>> What is morbid obesity?

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Greater than-- significantly
greater than 20% over

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:84%
your, what your
body fat should be.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But you know we all know
people whose walking is

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:90%
impaired by how big they are.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.890 align:middle line:84%
If you're not in that category,
and you are overweight,

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that there's any
necessary consequence on health

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.660 align:middle line:84%
or longevity if you keep
yourself fit and healthy,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.070 align:middle line:84%
meaning that you get adequate
exercise, and you eat well.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So I think I think that
the obsession with leanness

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:84%
has even distorted our
medical information.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that men
really like skinny women?

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can only
speak for myself.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't like people
that look skeletal.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.970 align:middle line:90%
I also like some heft.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Well you don't--

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
so maybe, in a way,
we are trying--

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:84%
we women, particularly,
are trying

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:84%
to achieve a figure that is
not even attractive to who

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:90%
we want to attract.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that
is very possible.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:10%
I think that the fashion
industry has probably

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:10%
done a lot of women
a great disservice.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the consoling things
I read once is that Marilyn

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Monroe wore a size 12.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, right.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We are all trying to
get down to a size 6,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
but Marilyn Monroe, the
sex goddess of all time--

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>> That is great.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:90%
That is great.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Size 12.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Good, I like this.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that
certainly one strategy

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:84%
for dealing with all
of this is to learn

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:90%
to like your body type.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I know that's a hard
thing to ask of people,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.810 align:middle line:84%
but liking your body the
way it is is the first step

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.450 align:middle line:90%
toward changing it.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you also cut out-- you
said you cut out white bread

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:90%
or cut out bread?

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I reduced my
consumption of bread.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> And what about sugar?

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it depends what
you mean by sugar because when

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people say they
eat sugar or eat sweets.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:84%
What they're talking about
are pastries, cakes--

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, hold that
thought because this is a real

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:90%
important point.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking to Dr.
Andrew Weil here about one

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:90%
of our favorite topics.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:90%
How do we get skinny?

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
He has written a book called
"Eating Well for Optimum

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Health."

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Stay with it.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to miss this.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.023 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:10:35.023 --> 00:10:37.105 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:37.105 --> 00:10:41.410 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:84%
We have a big treat
for you today.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:10%
If you've just
joined us, we want

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:10%
you to know that we are
talking to the Dr. Andrew

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.780 align:middle line:10%
Weil who is the author of
"Eating Well for Optimum

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.050 align:middle line:10%
Health."

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:84%
When we closed the
last segment, Andrew,

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about one of
our favorite subjects, sugar.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Actually, sugar itself has
an intermediate glycemic index.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not as bad as many
white flour products.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:84%
I think, when people
say they go for sweets,

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.770 align:middle line:84%
often, they're going
for unhealthy foods.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:84%
They're going for pies,
cakes, pastries, donuts.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
That stuff clearly is bad
and promotes weight gain.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.590 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing wrong with
an occasional sweet itself.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Either in the form of good
fruit, maybe some fruits--

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.883 align:middle line:90%
>> That doesn't count.

00:11:26.883 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That doesn't count.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:90%
How about talk about chocolate.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Chocolate, OK,
now we're talking.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I think high-quality
dark chocolate is fine

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:90%
in moderation.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:90%
This is a good treat.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%
First of all chocolate has
good antioxidant activity

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:84%
similar to red
wine or green tea.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.420 align:middle line:84%
In high quality
chocolate, there's

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.750 align:middle line:90%
a lot of actual cacoa present.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:84%
The fat in chocolate--
cacoa butter

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.560 align:middle line:84%
has a neutral effect
on cholesterol

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.750 align:middle line:84%
or even a slightly
beneficial effect.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:57.992 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this is a great
way to satisfy sweet cravings.

00:11:57.992 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
There's relatively-- actually
the percentage of sugar

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:90%
is not that high.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
perfectly OK sweet treat.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember the with
the Weight Watcher lady,

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.225 align:middle line:90%
what's her name--

00:12:08.225 --> 00:12:09.025 align:middle line:90%
Jean--

00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes, right.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>> She used to say, there is
no such thing to a fatty as one

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:90%
cookie.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.207 align:middle line:84%
Now, is there is such a thing
as one piece of chocolate?

00:12:18.207 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I think there is.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I find this to be true
that I can break off

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:84%
the square of a high
quality chocolate bar,

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.150 align:middle line:84%
let it slowly
dissolve in my mouth

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.400 align:middle line:90%
and really have it satisfying.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But you obviously have
a very fine character.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's
possible to do that.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.145 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, if you're
out in a restaurant,

00:12:37.145 --> 00:12:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and you want a dessert, so
order a dessert for the table,

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:84%
and have a bite of
it or a bite or two.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.605 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:12:43.605 --> 00:12:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I think if you try
to deprive yourself,

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:84%
you're setting yourself up
for binging on something

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:90%
or craving it.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I really
am more concerned

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:84%
about a lot of
the starchy things

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:90%
we eat than the sugary things.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And a very simple tip
for people in restaurants

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:84%
is to tell waiters not to bring
bread and butter until the meal

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:90%
arrives if at all.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.490 align:middle line:84%
It is so easy to load up on
a vast amount of calories

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:84%
of the worst kind of
starch even before you

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.370 align:middle line:90%
get to eating your appetizer.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So what would be a
diet that would be--

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:84%
let's reduce it down to
just a couple of things.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, great, well, the diet
that I recommend in this book I

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.892 align:middle line:90%
think will help people.

00:13:23.892 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I'd like to
shift the conversation some

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.415 align:middle line:84%
away from a focus on weight
loss and focus on health.

00:13:28.415 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I think it is much
better to look

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
at diet as a way of maintaining
and enhancing health than just

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:90%
about weight loss.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
You lost half of the
audience right there.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sorry.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.557 align:middle line:90%
>> They want to lose weight.

00:13:37.557 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I would recommend going
on a diet have 50% to 60%

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:90%
of calories as carbohydrate.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you are
carbohydrate sensitive,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.302 align:middle line:84%
you want to pay particular
attention to the glycemic index

00:13:50.302 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and to stay away from
these high-glycemic index

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.320 align:middle line:90%
foods, all the fluffy stuff.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>> So those are--

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:90%
high glycemic would be bread.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.102 align:middle line:84%
>> It's most-- a
lot of potatoes.

00:13:58.102 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>> What about sweet potatoes?

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet potatoes are OK.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Even waxing new potatoes
are OK in moderation--

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:84%
it's the flowery,
big flowery potatoes.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>> The mashed potatoes.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>> You want to try to
stay away from white--

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.580 align:middle line:84%
as many white flour
products as you

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:84%
can and even whole wheat bread
that's essentially the same.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.090 align:middle line:90%
It's colored white bread.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I think you want to avoid
immoderate quantities of pasta.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:84%
You want to be
moderate about that.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:84%
In terms of rice,
Basmati rice is

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
better than sticky,
Chinese or Japanese rice.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That was interesting to me.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Interesting to know
about that, right.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:90%
But that's basic information.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I would also say that you
want to eat about 10% to 20%

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:90%
of calories as protein.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'd recommend that, as
much as possible, of that

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.490 align:middle line:84%
be fish and vegetable
protein because this

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.770 align:middle line:90%
has healthful elements in it.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And soy products
are right in there.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I would say that
you can have 25% to 30%

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:90%
of calories as fat.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And my recommendation is your
principle fat the olive oil

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and that you make a great
effort to increase consumption

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:03.060 align:middle line:84%
of omega-3 fatty acids by eating
fish like salmon or sardines

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:84%
or herring or walnuts or
flax seeds or soy products,

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.220 align:middle line:90%
which give you some of it.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.095 align:middle line:84%
>> But you kind of
limit, in your book,

00:15:14.095 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:84%
the fish that we can eat
because you say so much of it is

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:90%
contaminated.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is a problem.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you
know some fish are

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.080 align:middle line:90%
more of a danger than others.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.578 align:middle line:90%
I would not eat swordfish.

00:15:24.578 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
It's too big, and it's
too carnivorous and likely

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:90%
to concentrate toxins.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Sardines I think are OK.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.780 align:middle line:84%
They're a little
fish, and they're

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:90%
a good source of omega-3s.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is a big fish--

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The bigger the fish and
the more carnivorous it is,

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
the more it's at the
top of its food chain,

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and the more it accumulates
all the toxins at every level

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
of this chain by which
smaller things, which--

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.802 align:middle line:90%
bigger things eats more things.

00:15:48.802 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, you
say salmon is good.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.310 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty big fish.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Salmon is a pretty big fish.

00:15:52.602 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:84%
It's probably in the middle
range in terms of toxicity.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Most of the salmon
we get now is farmed.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.800 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to farm
salmon in clean water.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I have seen some organic farmed
salmon available in which drugs

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.280 align:middle line:90%
are not used, like antibiotics.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
much farmed salmon

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.440 align:middle line:84%
has a lower omega-3
content than wild salmon,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:84%
but that could
easily be adjusted

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:90%
by what you feed the salmon.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And it would be great
if people started

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
making high omega-3 farmed
salmon that was clean--

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.257 align:middle line:90%
could easily happen.

00:16:20.257 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:90%
There's a new egg on the market.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
These are high omega-3
eggs that have--

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah I bought
some the other day.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>> They taste good,
and they're good.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.950 align:middle line:90%
So this is another good source--

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>> --and mild.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah this is another good
source of omega-3 fatty acids.

00:16:31.362 --> 00:16:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, I read your book.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Since I first met you,
I now put my olive oil

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:90%
in the refrigerator.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, right.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's OK to
leave a little bit out

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:84%
except in the real hot time of
year because it's convenient.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think you don't want to
buy oils in big quantities.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Keep them in the refrigerator
because it retards oxidation,

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:90%
which is much healthier.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
want to be eating

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:84%
plenty of fruits and vegetables
of good quality on any diet.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, what about--

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about nitty-gritty
here, Haagen-Dazs ice cream?

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.835 align:middle line:90%
How terrible is it?

00:17:02.835 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it is--

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.250 align:middle line:84%
a little bit now and
then it's probably OK.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
But in some ways,
maybe it's even better

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.369 align:middle line:90%
than low-fat frozen yogurt.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the low-fat
frozen yogurt,

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.180 align:middle line:84%
you've got more high glycemic
index carbohydrate calories

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You say stay away from
everything that says no fat

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:90%
or low fat.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.588 align:middle line:84%
>> I think-- we'll,
look what's happened.

00:17:25.588 --> 00:17:28.590 align:middle line:84%
As no fat and low fat foods have
become more and more prominent

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:84%
in the American
marketplace, Americans

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:90%
have steadily gotten fatter.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So something's wrong
with that picture.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
things is that people imagine

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that you could eat these foods
with abandon, that they're

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:90%
no-calorie foods.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And that certainly
is not the case.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:45.453 align:middle line:84%
And often, the low fat foods
have higher amounts of sugar

00:17:45.453 --> 00:17:47.370 align:middle line:84%
to make them taste better,
and that's probably

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
worse for people who are
carbohydrate sensitive.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe we get more
satisfied with a food that has

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:90%
a higher fat content.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Fat is more satiating, and I
think that's one reason, again,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.480 align:middle line:84%
why the Atkins diet may work
for people because, when you're

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:84%
eating high fat foods, you
have a sensation of fullness

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and satisfaction quicker,
and you actually may end up

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:90%
taking in fewer calories.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You also brought up the
point that it starts to get

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:90%
so boring, boring.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I said I think any
monotonous diet you will lose

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:90%
weight on.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I said in the book
that I probably

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.118 align:middle line:84%
could design an
all cheesecake diet

00:18:26.118 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that you can have as much
cheesecake as you want,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
but nothing but
cheesecake all day long.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Or the all ice cream diet--

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you would lose
weight on that, I'm sure.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.755 align:middle line:84%
However, again, that's probably
not healthy for long term.

00:18:39.755 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's talk about labels.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.588 align:middle line:84%
I know we're skipping
all over the place.

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:45.850 align:middle line:84%
There's so much in this book
that people have to learn from.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>> People need to be good
shoppers and wary consumers.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're lucky
to live at a time

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:84%
when food products have to state
their contents on the labels.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So you want to train yourself
to be a label detective.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.600 align:middle line:84%
One rule that I follow
is, if they can barely

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
fit all the words on the label,
put it back on the shelf.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:84%
If it's something you
would make at home,

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.275 align:middle line:84%
think of what ingredients
you would use to make it.

00:19:08.275 --> 00:19:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And if there's too many
things there that you never

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.330 align:middle line:84%
heard of that you
wouldn't use at home,

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:90%
put it back on the shelf.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
If the words, "partially
hydrogenated" anything appear,

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:90%
put it back on the shelf.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Don't buy things with
artificial colors in them.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.410 align:middle line:90%
These are some simple rules.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Another one-- there are some
label deceptions out there.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the worst is
the serving size.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.440 align:middle line:90%
You can buy a bag of chips.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And I could easily eat half
of that in no time, maybe

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing, and it gives
you the calories per serving,

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and then you see that there's
12 servings in the bag.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:90%
That's very misleading.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's two potato chips.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, very misleading,
so you've got to take that

00:19:43.627 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:90%
into account.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that was one of the
most important tips you said

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.423 align:middle line:90%
in your book.

00:19:48.423 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people say I
can't read that little print

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
to look for the words
partially hydrogenated,

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.565 align:middle line:84%
you just say, look
at how long it is.

00:19:56.565 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's a good one.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.398 align:middle line:84%
>> And do that even
without your glasses.

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.528 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't have to read it.

00:20:01.528 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
If it's got a lot of
print, don't buy it.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't buy it.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The other tip that was kind
of interesting is you said,

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
don't bother going
down the aisles.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.375 align:middle line:84%
Shopping on the periphery
of the supermarket.

00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Good Strategy-- in general,
the foods that are around

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:10%
the edge of the supermarket,
that's we're going to find

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:10%
the produce, for example, the
good quality fish and meats.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's the
interior of the store

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
you can find all the
refined and processed foods.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
American diet has

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
gotten more and more
top heavy and highly

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.700 align:middle line:90%
refined and processed foods.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a big factor
in the obesity problem

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:90%
that we've got in this country.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And many of these refined
and processed foods

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:84%
are unhealthy for
us in other ways.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.312 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one
of the things that

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:84%
protects people in countries
like France and Italy.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're eating foods
that we consider to be rich,

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
they're eating smaller
quantities of them,

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:90%
and they're not eating all--

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Plus they're more
satisfying maybe.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so, absolutely.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.953 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
eating fast food--

00:21:01.953 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:84%
they're going to learn to, but
they're not, at the moment,

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:84%
eating fast food
or processed food.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Here's an interesting story.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I have known-- I wonder
if you've known this too.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.918 align:middle line:84%
I've had a number
of friends who've

00:21:10.918 --> 00:21:13.910 align:middle line:84%
gone for vacations in France
and Italy for say a week

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
or two who are
concerned about weight

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and just decided they were going
to throw caution to the wind,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:90%
pay no attention.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to eat.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And they insist they got no more
activity than they do at home,

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and they come back
to face the scales,

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and, to their amazement,
they're the same

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:84%
or even have lost
a pound or two,

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and they can't
understand what happened.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I think what happened is
actually they have not

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:90%
been eating as much.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And even though they
think they have,

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.730 align:middle line:84%
the food it's been
so satisfying,

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and you devote all
this attention to it.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
you eat on the run.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.540 align:middle line:84%
It's really a major part
of your day and focus,

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:90%
and you're satisfied.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And French people,
I think, do not--

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:55.340 align:middle line:84%
they go to the fresh
markets to buy vegetables.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:84%
They don't go and get
something off the shelf

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and then throw a
can of onion rings

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:84%
in it to mix it up and make--
they put some onion in it.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, but, however, it's
very sad to note how quickly

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.540 align:middle line:84%
this is changing all over
the world as a result of us.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:84%
We are exporting American
fast food everywhere

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:90%
very successful.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.390 align:middle line:84%
My editor has a home in
southern France near Provence.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me that an American
fast food restaurant opened

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
in this region, and it's now
the most popular restaurant

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:90%
in the area.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's too bad.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Sad.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry to hear that.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've been having a
wonderful time here talking

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to Dr. Andrew Weil,
who is one of the most

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.590 align:middle line:84%
controversial doctors in the
world, about his new book,

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.618 align:middle line:84%
"Eating Well for
Optimum Health."

00:22:42.618 --> 00:22:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And as I always tell
you around here,

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:84%
we bring you the most important
new messengers in publishing

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:90%
today on this show.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.760 align:middle line:84%
These are authors
who care that you.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Keep coming back.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:90%
