00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Orloff, author of "Dr.
Judith Orloff's Guide

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:90%
to Intuitive Healing."

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Can we heal our own
body, our emotions?

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Promote our own sexual wellness?

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Judith Orloff, psychiatrist,
intuitive and author

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:84%
of "Dr. Judith Orloff's
Guide to Intuitive Healing,"

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
says we can if we listen
to ourselves, our body

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:90%
signals and even our dreams.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Welcome again to
Wisdom Television.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's great
to be back again.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You say that this is a
health care revolution today.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, I believe that intuitive
healing is a health care

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:10%
revolution.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:10%
We're going from being purely
technologized and the icy

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:10%
sterility of that to a
movement towards coming back

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:10%
to the heart and coming
back to intuition,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.517 align:middle line:10%
coming back to listening to our
patients in a very deep way.

00:01:28.517 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is what
patients are looking for.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:84%
They're very tired of
being talked down to,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:84%
of having their intuition
not listened to.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.145 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
intuitive healing

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:84%
is about is bringing back
that honoring of intuition

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality and
along with the technology.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Wedding all of these things
together to help people.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>> People come to you
as a psychiatrist.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Don't they want you to
give them the answers?

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they want to--
they want guidance.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the type of doctor
who gives out answers,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.870 align:middle line:90%
because I don't believe in that.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
But the way I do work, as an
intuitive, as a psychiatrist,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
is to help people ignite
the healing in themselves.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.465 align:middle line:84%
And if I can do that
through my intuitions,

00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:84%
if I can do that through helping
them develop their intuitions,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.860 align:middle line:90%
this is a beautiful thing.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
But what happens in
the past is people

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
tend to disempower
themselves around doctors,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and this happens
around me a lot.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Being a psychiatrist
and an intuitive,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:84%
what people try and do is
disempower themselves and think

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:84%
that I'll be able
to do it for them,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:84%
which is counterproductive
and it's nothing

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:90%
that I would ever do.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:84%
My job is to
empower other people

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:90%
to develop their intuitions.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>> But don't they
fight you on that?

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't they say, well,
you're an intuitive.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what's going to
happen with my boyfriend.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, they do.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:84%
They always try
to-- even patients

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with a long
time they try and catch me

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.735 align:middle line:90%
with that, but I never do.

00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Always, when I do intuitive
readings with patients,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I ask them to do
intuitive readings too

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and then we correlate
ours together.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
empowering people,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.660 align:middle line:84%
because we all have this
capacity to tune in.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm certainly not the
only one who can do that.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And everyone needs to
be able to do that.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful thing working
with patients in therapy

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.198 align:middle line:84%
is once they're
able to get in touch

00:03:01.198 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:84%
with their intuitive voice,
then, a lot of times,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.950 align:middle line:84%
they can leave
therapy, and no matter

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
what they go through
in their lives,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.283 align:middle line:84%
all of the ups and downs
they have something

00:03:08.283 --> 00:03:10.590 align:middle line:84%
to turn to inside
to listen to that

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:84%
will tell them the
truth about things.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
beginning of my therapy

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:84%
with every patient
is teaching them

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:84%
to get in touch with
this intuitive voice

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with all the
resistances to doing so.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>> You say there are five ways
to start getting in touch with

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:90%
your--

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>> --intuitive voice.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
I go through five steps
in intuitive healing,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and these really are the
steps I live in my own life

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and teach to my patients
about developing intuition.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And they are, one, noticing
your beliefs about healing, two,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:84%
being in your body,
three, learning

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:84%
to sense your subtle
energies, four,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:84%
asking for inner guidance,
and five, listening to dreams.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And in the book,
in each chapter,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I go through the five steps
in every single chapter

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
as a strategy for
dealing with any problem

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:90%
that you'll ever deal with.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is a way of
seeing beyond surfaces

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and getting to a
sense of truth within.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about depression.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Notice your belief.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, my belief is that my
mother was a manic depressive,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother was
a manic depressive.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I had two cousins who
have committed suicide.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:90%
So naturally, I am a depressive.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.670 align:middle line:90%
Give me some pills.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.700 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is one
of the premises

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that I really
challenge in the book.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And that we have to be very
careful to use intuition

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.857 align:middle line:84%
to not take on the
diseases of our lineage,

00:04:31.857 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
because I think we make
a mistake with that.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's a tendency
to over identify

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
with parents or our
own lineage and say,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:90%
we're going to get this too.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And I came upon this
in a very personal way

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.860 align:middle line:84%
after my mother died
of lymphoma and then

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.555 align:middle line:84%
my father died of
Parkinson's disease.

00:04:45.555 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I was going through this little
box that they left for me

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and had all the most
precious things in my life.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:84%
It had my first baby hair,
it had all of my report cards

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
from when I was a little
girl, and they kept all

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:90%
these little milestones for me.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:84%
But also in this box was a
piece of paper dated 1976, which

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
was the initial diagnosis
of my mother's lymphoma,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and she put it in the box
with all of my milestones.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And my first reaction
was, oh my god,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get lymphoma too.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.717 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I said, no, stop.

00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:90%
You have to tune in.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
You have to use your intuition
to see if this is true.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And I tuned in and I got
definitely it wasn't true,

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
but that no matter how
much I love my mother,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I had to disengage from
her patterns of physical

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and emotional illness
that I didn't necessarily

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:90%
have to take on.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.530 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's important.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:90%
Genetics are important.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I think it behooves
us to honor them,

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:90%
but they're not everything.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And the parents-- the
patterns of our parents,

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to take on if
we do our own healing work.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you give any of
your patients medication?

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.255 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there's a
section in the book

00:05:46.255 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
on the intuitive
use of medications,

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:90%
antidepressants anti-anxieties.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, particularly
with depression,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:84%
certain people have
a lack of serotonin.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And with that lack
of serotonin, it's

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:84%
like going uphill
to find your center.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the best solution
is to take antidepressants

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:84%
for a short period of
time, or for some people

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
need to be on at a
lifetime, you know,

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.503 align:middle line:90%
and God bless if that's so.

00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have no
judgment about that

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
at all, but what I'm
very strong about

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.193 align:middle line:84%
is if someone's on
medication that I also

00:06:15.193 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
do intuitive work
within them and I also

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
do spiritual work with them and
they listen to their bodies,

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.570 align:middle line:84%
listen to their body
energies with the medication

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.370 align:middle line:90%
in their system.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that medication,
everything has a spirit to it.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And if we could intuitively
connect with the spirit--

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:90%
even let's say a Prozac.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Prozac has a spirit.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we can connect
with it, then we

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.860 align:middle line:84%
can work with this
substance in our system

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.318 align:middle line:84%
so it's not just an
alien substance roaming

00:06:38.318 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
around doing as it
will, but it's something

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.160 align:middle line:84%
that we can intuitively
connect with.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And so if one of my
patients is on medication,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I work with them to tune
into their intuition

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and open up spiritually.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.272 align:middle line:84%
The psychopharmacologist who
just writes a prescription

00:06:51.272 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and sends someone home
with a medication,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm very much against.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.365 align:middle line:84%
>> But that seems to
be a tendency now.

00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:57.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh that's--

00:06:57.165 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> The 15-minute appointment.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's right.

00:06:59.243 --> 00:07:00.990 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole
trend in psychiatry

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:84%
now is the easy
fix with the pill.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not against
correcting biochemistry,

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
because I know how devastating
depression can feel.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:84%
When someone is very depressed,
they could have the most

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.053 align:middle line:84%
beautiful rose in front of them
and they cannot see the beauty

00:07:13.053 --> 00:07:14.027 align:middle line:90%
of it, they can't.

00:07:14.027 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And they can't connect
with their sense of spirit,

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:84%
they can't meditate, because the
biochemistry is stopping them.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes medication
is the most compassionate way

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:90%
to go.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But each person has to
tune in to whether or not

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
that's the way for them
and also to tune in

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.390 align:middle line:90%
to know when to go off of it.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.520 align:middle line:84%
My patients will come
to me and say, I really

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
think now's the time to
start decreasing the dosage.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And I honor their response
and I listen to my patients,

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of how
I work as an intuitive

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and teach my patients
to intuitively connect

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.120 align:middle line:84%
with whatever is going
on in their bodies,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
including putting
a substance in it.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So the next one said,
be in your body.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.957 align:middle line:84%
>> What does that
mean, be in your body?

00:07:50.957 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I feel passionately
about this step.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Because being in
the body is a way

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
of listening to the intuitive
signals in the body.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
It means being
centrally connected

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:84%
to the feelings in
the body, but also, it

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:84%
means learning about our
internal workings of our body.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And I suggest to everyone
to go out and buy

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
"Gray's Anatomy" coloring book
to learn where our organs are.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.930 align:middle line:84%
It is just amazing
to me how most people

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:84%
go through a lifetime
and never know

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:90%
what they look like inside.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, we're brought
up with a tremendous revulsion

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:84%
of the human body
and secretions,

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and this stops our
intuitive healing.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And so part of what I'm
suggesting in the book

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.570 align:middle line:84%
is that people learn that
their liver is on the right,

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:84%
that their stomach is on their
left, where their GI tract is,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:90%
the basic function of each.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So then if you do get sick, you
know where to direct energy.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, if you have no idea
what's inside of yourself,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.409 align:middle line:10%
it's a big blob in
there, so you don't

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:10%
know how to direct energy.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And plus, learning
about the body

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
is a way of honoring the
body and the preciousness

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:84%
of the human form and
to try and deprogram

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:84%
the sense of
revulsion that we have

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:84%
for our body and all of his
life affirming functions.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And so if we do this
before we get sick,

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:84%
then, in case we
do get sick, we're

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.450 align:middle line:84%
not trying to heal
a body we hate.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you said directing
energy toward that portion.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean by that?

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, the third step
of intuitive healing

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle line:84%
is learning how to
sense subtle energies.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:84%
We're made up of
energy fields that

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:84%
penetrate the physical
body and go beyond it.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:84%
You can consider it the
aura or the energy field

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:90%
or light around the body.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes children can see
it as beautiful colors,

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:90%
or mystics can see it.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Chinese medical
practitioners call it chi.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:90%
It's the energy in the body.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's a subtle
form of healing

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.160 align:middle line:84%
that if we want to
develop intuition,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
it's really important
to connect with that.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it's possible-- let's
say you have hepatitis C

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.220 align:middle line:90%
in your liver--

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle line:84%
to begin to really channel
energy to the liver.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.380 align:middle line:90%
You can visualize the liver.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>> First you find
out where it is.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>> First you find out where
it is and what it does.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.372 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful
detoxifying organ.

00:09:45.372 --> 00:09:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't be alive
without your liver.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a phenomenally
beautiful, wonderful organ.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:90%
So you learn where it is.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:90%
It's on the right.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a triangle.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.050 align:middle line:84%
You begin to then channel
energy from your heart.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Focus energy from the
heart, put into the liver,

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.603 align:middle line:90%
and that helps to heal it.

00:09:59.603 --> 00:10:00.520 align:middle line:90%
So what that does is--

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's back up.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:84%
How do you get the
energy in your heart?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, part of intuitive
development and developing

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
subtle energies is learning
how to sit quietly and begin

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:84%
to feel a sense of love
that comes from this energy

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.500 align:middle line:90%
center called the heart chakra.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Heart chakra.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Stay with that thought, because
I love to talk about hearts.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I also think liver
livers are beautiful,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.158 align:middle line:84%
but I never thought
of this before.

00:10:23.158 --> 00:10:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Livers are gorgeous.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking to Dr. Judith
Orloff about her wonderful

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:84%
book, it's called "Dr. Judith
Orloff's Guide to Intuitive

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Healing."

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
miss one word of this.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.837 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.110 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to Dr. Judith
Orloff about her book "Dr.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.640 align:middle line:10%
Judith Orloff's Guide
to Intuitive Healing."

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Judith.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's great to be here.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>> You said that you get
energy from your heart,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:84%
but where does the
heart get the energy?

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:10%
>> The heart is the--

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:10%
heart chakra is an energy center
in the midline of the body, not

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.445 align:middle line:10%
over the anatomic heart
which is over to the left.

00:11:04.445 --> 00:11:05.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's an energy center--

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's right in the middle.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It's right here,
right in the middle.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And by focusing on everything
loving you could ever

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.970 align:middle line:84%
conceive of, you develop
the heart energy,

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and you could do this through
a meditation practice.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
develop the heart,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:84%
you begin to feel this warm
sun glowing within you.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's a palpable
sensation everybody

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.330 align:middle line:84%
who's interested in intuitive
healing needs to know.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Then as a function
of feeling it,

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.190 align:middle line:84%
you can begin to channel it
down your arm and out your hand

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and you could send
it to yourself

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.200 align:middle line:90%
as a form of self nurturing.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people I treat
who have panic disorder,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I tell them, when they
begin to feel panic,

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.110 align:middle line:90%
put your hand over your heart.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Begin channeling that
energy and it calms down.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Or you can send it
to another person.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I put my hands on
my patient's body

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.810 align:middle line:84%
sending them energy as part
of my psychiatric practice.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of us sending
our love to another person.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:90%
We being the vessels.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
It's never ego, it's
never efforting.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It's being a vessel for
love to flow through.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a way of
healing with subtle energies.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say, if
some of your viewers

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.620 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
subtle energy is,

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.450 align:middle line:84%
the best way that
I know to explain

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.630 align:middle line:84%
it is in the
interaction with people

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.448 align:middle line:90%
known as energy vampires.

00:12:10.448 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:84%
There's certain
people that you could

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
meet who suck your energy dry,
and you're standing around them

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:90%
and you feel it.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.488 align:middle line:84%
Your energy bottoms out, you get
nauseous, you get a headache.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want everyone who's
watching this to really trust

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.500 align:middle line:90%
that in themselves.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're at a
party, and it could

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.082 align:middle line:84%
be with a perfectly nice
person, and your energy starts

00:12:25.082 --> 00:12:27.830 align:middle line:84%
bottoming out, there's a
subtle energetic reaction

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.370 align:middle line:84%
going on in which you're
being drained, all right?

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And to really begin to honor
that as a phenomenon intuitive

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.272 align:middle line:84%
phenomena that goes on and not
choose people to be around you

00:12:36.272 --> 00:12:37.730 align:middle line:84%
who are energy
vampires if that's--

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So you immediately
walk away from them.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>> If you can, at a party.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And I watch people at
parties, they don't.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
They could be around a
raving maniac or an energy

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:84%
vampires that's really sucking
them, and they won't move.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And you ask them
why, and they say,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:84%
they're afraid of
offending the person.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:52.400 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:52.940 align:middle line:90%
But I really--

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> In the meantime, they're
being very offended.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>> They're being drained.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a form of illness that's
happening and toxicity.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And so as a devotion
to our self nurturing,

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
we have to begin
to excuse ourselves

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.065 align:middle line:84%
from these people
whenever possible.

00:13:05.065 --> 00:13:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
chapter in the book

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
on centering and protection,
which I think is so important.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Strategies that
people learn to deal

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:84%
with energy vampires
or those in the world

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:90%
who are draining our energy.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
We have to know how
to do this so we don't

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.200 align:middle line:90%
feel so threatened about that.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:90%
But for people--

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Can somebody drain
your energy at a distance?

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yes, it's possible.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.185 align:middle line:84%
But no one can drain
your energy if you

00:13:26.185 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:84%
know how to come back to your
center and replenish yourself.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's so important.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:84%
That's a form of
intuitive healing

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:90%
that I teach in the book.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.740 align:middle line:90%
How to use meditation.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
If you notice your
energy is going down,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.800 align:middle line:84%
to come back to center,
focus on your heart,

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:84%
replenish from that
beautiful well.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Intuitive healing
is about learning

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.130 align:middle line:90%
how to replenish oneself.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Once you find your center,
your intuitive voice,

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:84%
you know how to come back to
it and you feel your heart,

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.550 align:middle line:84%
all you have to do is close
your eyes-- when I feel drained,

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I close my eyes,
I sense my heart,

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:90%
and it begins to fill me again.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's an important
coping skill we need to learn.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there are some people
you talk about in the book

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:90%
called empaths.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:90%
I was an intuitive empath.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little
girl, I couldn't

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
go into shopping malls
or crowded places,

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:84%
because I would walk in
feeling perfectly fine

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and then walk out
either totally exhausted

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.850 align:middle line:84%
or some new ache or
pain I didn't have

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:84%
before or with
depression or anxiety,

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.003 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
what was happening.

00:14:18.003 --> 00:14:18.920 align:middle line:90%
And I told my parents.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, you don't
have a thick enough skin,

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
you're overly
sensitive, you know,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.490 align:middle line:84%
these zingers that parents
just all have said to us.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:84%
But what was happening was
that I was an intuitive empath.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I was sensitive to feeling
other people's energy.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a crowded place,
all the energy fields intersect

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and it could be
quite overwhelming.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And agoraphobics who are
afraid of going out of doors

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.640 align:middle line:84%
are often intuitive empaths
and they don't know it.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.953 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever I work
with an agoraphobic,

00:14:43.953 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:84%
I have to teach them how to
ground their energy so they're

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.070 align:middle line:84%
not overwhelmed by the
intensity of a group.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.820 align:middle line:90%
Then they can go back out again.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:90%
But the--

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.505 align:middle line:84%
>> People who don't like
big parties, for example.

00:14:53.505 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:84%
That's a sign that you're
an intuitive empath.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I go through signs
in the book of what

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to look for if you're
an intuitive empath.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's important that
everyone know if you are,

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.765 align:middle line:84%
otherwise, you have no idea
what's happening to you.

00:15:04.765 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:84%
But now, I've got
to say, I mean,

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.307 align:middle line:84%
I speak in front of hundreds
of people all the time,

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and especially on this
book tour, every night,

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm someplace different
and very rarely

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.270 align:middle line:90%
does my energy get drained.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.645 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to
replenish myself now.

00:15:15.645 --> 00:15:16.445 align:middle line:90%
So I--

00:15:16.445 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you center
yourself in your heart.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you picture a sun there?

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel a sun.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not an actual--
it's not a visualization,

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.800 align:middle line:84%
it's a firsthand experience of
a bright warm sun in my heart.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way I
can describe it for me.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is different.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to get
your own imagery.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:90%
But it's this beautiful--

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.773 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it as we're speaking.

00:15:34.773 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:84%
As you're so heart
centered, it starts

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:90%
my own heart being activated.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful
sun in my heart

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's not only
something I could feel,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.210 align:middle line:84%
it's something I could
channel down my hand and out.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I go and I
speak to doctors groups,

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:84%
they typically are
the most resistant.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.283 align:middle line:90%
I'll go in 10 minutes before--

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You must feel a barrage of
resistance when you walk in.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there is.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.297 align:middle line:84%
But for that reason, I
go in 10 minutes before

00:15:56.297 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and I channel heart
energy in the room.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like fairy dust.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh really?

00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like fairy dust.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
It goes from the
body, out the hands,

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.537 align:middle line:84%
and it can really go
all around the room

00:16:03.537 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
so that when resistant
people come in,

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.280 align:middle line:84%
they suddenly start
to get a little happy

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know why.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.527 align:middle line:84%
But it's a really
good technique that I

00:16:10.527 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:84%
used to help melt
resistance, and they

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's happened.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So these same steps, there's
an interesting part of the book

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:90%
called remote--

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:90%
you talk about remote viewing.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, as a form of--

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>> To really get a fix on what
is happening outside of you.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.490 align:middle line:90%
Never mind--

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:84%
That's step four is
asking for inner guidance.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And as a way of asking
for inner guidance,

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
I teach a technique known
as remote viewing, which

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
is a form of intuitively tuning
into a person at a distance

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
or tuning into your
body or tuning into--

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, people are
doing experiments even

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.985 align:middle line:84%
in the government on
this, aren't they?

00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, for 20 years they
did top secret experiments

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.410 align:middle line:84%
at the Stanford Research
Institute on remote viewing.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And they mainly used it
for military purposes,

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.540 align:middle line:84%
where they would have remote
viewers in Stanford tuning

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:84%
into what was going on in
Russia during the Cold War,

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying to use
it for a strategic military

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.460 align:middle line:90%
espionage, basically.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the top
secret ban was lifted

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and all the scientists
started talking about it.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And I don't use remote
viewing for those purposes.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I use remote
viewing for healing.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:13.097 align:middle line:84%
And I teach every one of my
patients how to tune in to,

00:17:13.097 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
let's say if they're
about to go into a job,

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.483 align:middle line:84%
to tune into their
boss to find out

00:17:16.483 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
if this is the type of
person you want to work with.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And they get all
kinds of intuitions

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:90%
before you even go in.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And to make decisions that
factor in your remote viewing

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's do a little bit of this.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:90%
How do you do it?

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Say somebody has
a friend who they

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.860 align:middle line:84%
haven't heard from
in a long time,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:90%
and the friend has been ill.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.508 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:17:36.508 --> 00:17:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you sit down, you want
to find out how this person is.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:39.950 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you do is
you just get very quiet

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.285 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to breathe, and
whatever thoughts you have,

00:17:45.285 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:84%
all of the laundry list of
things to do and the problems,

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:84%
you can set those aside
just for a few moments.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.380 align:middle line:84%
They'll be there
when you come back.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And to go in and
just use the breath

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
as a hypnotic incantation to
center the self on the breath.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:middle line:84%
If you just breathe and
breathe and breathe,

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:84%
that helps you get
out of your mind.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Then you sit in that quiet
state and then you very lightly

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:90%
tune into your friend.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:84%
You don't try and
visualize anything.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.570 align:middle line:84%
You just ask for any images
or impressions or knowings

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.533 align:middle line:84%
that come, and then you just
wait and see what you get.

00:18:13.533 --> 00:18:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And you might get a sense, I
need to call this friend now.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:16.908 align:middle line:90%
This friend is in need.

00:18:16.908 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:90%
I need to do something.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll
pick up the phone.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.603 align:middle line:84%
Or you might get a sense this
person is feeling a lot better.

00:18:22.603 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
They're getting
their energy back.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:84%
You'll have the sense
in your own body

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.170 align:middle line:84%
or through images
what's going on

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and you can get all
kinds of knowledge

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:31.850 align:middle line:90%
about how to help people.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:90%
That's how I use my intuition--

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:90%
only it's for love and service.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't if you put me in a place
to predict lottery numbers,

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.740 align:middle line:84%
I could never do that,
because I'm not good at it,

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:84%
nor do I have any
interest in it.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you put me in a situation
where I can help somebody,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:84%
then my intuition really
becomes amplified.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's true
for a lot of people.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:84%
When it's used for
heart purposes,

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
if you want to tune
into your friend,

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.360 align:middle line:84%
you're not sure
how they're doing,

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.837 align:middle line:84%
you want to help
them in some way,

00:18:54.837 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:84%
then the intuition
really gets turned.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And remote viewing
can help with that.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about it
in a different context.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it in business.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.090 align:middle line:90%
What about if you're a salesman?

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you--

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you do this to find out
whether this is a good time

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:90%
to make a pitch on a sale?

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing and
intuitive readings

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.223 align:middle line:90%
give you a sense of timing.

00:19:15.223 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:84%
You get a sense of the
timing is right for something

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and when to jump on it, or
if the timing is not right.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
What I was alluding
to about tuning

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.707 align:middle line:84%
into an intuitive yes or
no, you tune in you say,

00:19:24.707 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:84%
is this a good time to
promote this product?

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:84%
You go in, you ask for
intuitive yes or no.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Do you get a
quickening of energy,

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.923 align:middle line:84%
do you get a sense of
excitement pulling you forward,

00:19:32.923 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:84%
or do you get a sinking
feeling or that nothing much

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.890 align:middle line:84%
is happening, you're
trying to effort?

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:84%
You need to factor
in those intuitions.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you get a
no, then you wait.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:90%
There's wisdom in waiting.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:42.590 align:middle line:90%
We don't know--

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Suppose you get nothing?

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Then you don't act.

00:19:45.165 --> 00:19:46.540 align:middle line:84%
You wait until
you get something.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you trust this?

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Implicitly.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.623 align:middle line:84%
I have learned to really craft
my whole life around this,

00:19:52.623 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:90%
because I've learned--

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I've not listened
for so long and I

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:84%
saw all of the negative
effects that can happen.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a battering that
happens when people don't

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:90%
listen to their intuition.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.793 align:middle line:84%
And for those who do, life
expands and becomes incredible.

00:20:05.793 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
When people get into
the intuitive flow,

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:90%
synchronicities happen.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Magic happens that
could never go on

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:90%
with just the rational mind.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.750 align:middle line:84%
The rational mind is wonderful,
but it can't understand things

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:16.550 align:middle line:90%
like love.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.580 align:middle line:84%
It can't understand things like
the mystery of illness or death

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.630 align:middle line:90%
or intuition.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't
have that capacity.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you begin to get
into the intuitive flow,

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:84%
it's like you get in
touch with a pulse.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you start meeting people
and pass cross and deja

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:84%
vus happen, and all these
intuitive experiences

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
become part of
everyday life, which

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:35.820 align:middle line:90%
brings magic and wonder to it.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And plus, it's a lot easier
to navigate this world

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.170 align:middle line:84%
when you're in touch
with this flow.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Suppose you're
very intuitive,

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and you really get a fix
and you know something.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.773 align:middle line:90%
>> You just know it.

00:20:46.773 --> 00:20:47.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:47.573 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And it doesn't happen.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:84%
How do you keep the faith
when it doesn't happen,

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:90%
when you're so sure?

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I would question
then the sense of timing.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.728 align:middle line:10%
Because sometimes
you can tune in

00:20:58.728 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:10%
and know that something
is going to happen,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.347 align:middle line:10%
and yet, it's not
in your time frame.

00:21:02.347 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what I suggest
at those points,

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:84%
particularly when people have
premonitory dreams, to write it

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:90%
down and then just wait.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.180 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty with intuition
is there's no time and no space,

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and so it's harder
to pinpoint timing.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I had psychic
dreams that happened

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:84%
10 years before the
actual event happened.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.917 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do, I just
chronicle everything

00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:90%
and I remember everything.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.295 align:middle line:84%
And when something
happens, let's say 10 years

00:21:26.295 --> 00:21:28.170 align:middle line:84%
down the line, I go back
to my dream journal.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.060 align:middle line:84%
I start and I go
yes this did happen.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.062 align:middle line:84%
Because it's important to get
feedback on your intuitions

00:21:33.062 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and see, yes, I dreamed that
this happened and it happened.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Isn't this exciting?

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful way of
getting positive feedback.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>> So be patient.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh you must.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.300 align:middle line:90%
You can't force anything.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So we sometimes pick things
up that are way in advance--

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's true.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:90%
That's very true.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --of what is
actually happening now.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I had an example of a woman
who came to me recently

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.432 align:middle line:84%
at a workshop and she said, I
got the name of my soulmate,

00:21:55.432 --> 00:21:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I got the date I was
going to meet my soulmate,

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:90%
it was 10 years to that day.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.598 align:middle line:84%
And she met him and she
felt that when she met him

00:22:02.598 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
it was amazing because
she didn't like him.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.230 align:middle line:84%
He was a chauvinist and
she didn't relate to him.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.772 align:middle line:84%
And she said, but
is there a destiny?

00:22:07.772 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to marry him?

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.417 align:middle line:90%
And I go, absolutely not.

00:22:10.417 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you pick
things up you don't

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:90%
know why you pick things up.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual
lesson of some sort.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.807 align:middle line:84%
Things aren't
always as they seem.

00:22:16.807 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
But what people need to do
and what I advised her is you

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.430 align:middle line:90%
must listen to your inner voice.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:90%
Is this your soulmate now?

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to marry him?

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:84%
It was the name of the person,
it was the date of the person,

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.250 align:middle line:90%
but how do you know?

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.890 align:middle line:84%
You have to trust what's
inside more than anything else.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So even if you pick it
up, you don't have to do it.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh no.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.670 align:middle line:84%
You always have to tune in
and say, is this appropriate?

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Is this right?

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So are you picking
up probabilities then,

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:90%
rather than--

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think probability
is a big part of it is that

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.860 align:middle line:90%
you're picking up--

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
let's say there's a 90%
chance of this happening.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
But if I hadn't listened
to my dream that

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:84%
told me to become
a psychiatrist,

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have become it.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:90%
I had--

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're very happy that
you became a psychiatrist.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you wrote
this wonderful book.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I wish we had a million,
million shows to do you, Judith.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.420 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking to
Dr. Judith Orloff, who

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:84%
is the author of "Dr. Judith
Orloff's Guide to Intuitive

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Healing."

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Don't miss this book.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:90%
It's my recommendation.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.010 align:middle line:84%
