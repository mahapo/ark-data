00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:19.640 align:middle line:10%
>> This is "Book Tours,"
and I'm Corinne Edwards.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:10%
Mention John Steinbeck, and
everyone recognizes the name.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But what the world does not know
is the story behind his stories

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and the effect of his
fame on his family.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Nancy Steinbeck, the widow of
his son, John Steinbeck IV,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:84%
tells it all and heard book,
"The Other Side of Eden."

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a tale of love,
devotion, and the devastation

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.070 align:middle line:90%
of alcoholism on a family.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And as many of you
know, you don't

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.150 align:middle line:84%
have to be famous to
experience this problem.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.402 align:middle line:84%
Nancy, welcome to
Wisdom Television.

00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It's wonderful to be here.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Corinne.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>> What a fabulous book.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm glad you liked it.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, when
your husband died,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
he was in process of
writing his autobiography.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.205 align:middle line:84%
And what prompted
you to pick it up?

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I had actually
made a promise to him.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:10%
He died in a back operation.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:10%
And before he went in for
surgery, I suddenly had a--

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:10%
well, based on a dream
I'd had that night

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:10%
about our German shepherd puppy
dying, and a voice saying,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm taking my angel back today.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And you're not supposed to
feel sorry for yourself.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
This is part of
the greater plan.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said to John
that morning, what

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:84%
happens if something-- what
should I do about your book?

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.095 align:middle line:90%
And he said, finish it.

00:01:40.095 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:90%
He didn't even miss a beat.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:90%
It was just like, finish it.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:90%
So I knew when he died--

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.312 align:middle line:84%
>> And this was not a
life-threatening operation.

00:01:46.312 --> 00:01:47.112 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:01:47.112 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>> --he was having.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was no reason for
you to have this premonition.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.326 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it was back surgery.

00:01:53.326 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So the book is it's
very interesting

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:84%
because it's his
book, but you fill

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
in the blanks of what happened
in between in both your lives.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because he had
only finished about 50%

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:90%
of the autobiography.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So the chapters are interwoven,
and there's the two voices.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems that both you and
your late husband John came

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
from similar backgrounds
of dysfunctional,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:90%
severely dysfunctional families.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, a lot of abuse, a lot of
boundaries crossed that should

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
never have been crossed, and
alcoholism, severe alcoholism.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, they say that 98%
of families are dysfunctional

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.510 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you agree with that?

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.466 align:middle line:90%
I think 100%.

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I think if you haven't
worked on yourself,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
it's just normal, because it's
a generational pattern that

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:90%
just goes through.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that consciousness has
changed in the last generation.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So those of us that are
raising kids now, especially

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
in the boomer generation,
I think we really

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
did come to some sort
of point where we said,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.570 align:middle line:90%
this will not be passed on.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:90%
It stops here.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:90%
It stops with my generation.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think people are
less now blaming their families

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.030 align:middle line:84%
for their problems
than they did before?

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I think there is more a point
where you have to stop saying,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I was the victim, and
poor me, and saying, I

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:90%
am not going to do this.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.415 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to
replicate those patterns.

00:03:22.415 --> 00:03:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, one of
the things that you--

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.240 align:middle line:84%
very interesting to
me, one of the things.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
You said there were rules of
dysfunctional families, three

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:90%
rules.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't talk, don't
trust, don't feel.

00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't talk about the elephant
in the living room, whether it's

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
daddy's drinking or
mom's rageaholism,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
or little brother
acting out all the time.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:90%
Don't talk about it.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And don't trust your instincts.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Listen to what the family tells
you, because it's like a cult.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:84%
They will tell you how this is
to be treated, how things are

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:90%
to be swept under the carpet.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:90%
And don't feel.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Don't pay attention
to your feelings.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Because god forbid if
you feel your feelings,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.636 align:middle line:84%
the truth will come out,
and you will be shunned.

00:04:03.636 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>> By society?

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.815 align:middle line:90%
>> No, by the family.

00:04:05.815 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, by the family.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like a cult. You
know, we don't talk about

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.170 align:middle line:90%
daddy's drinking.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:90%
We don't talk about mom's anger.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.946 align:middle line:84%
We don't talk about
mom's pill problem.

00:04:14.946 --> 00:04:16.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, having--

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a thing of,
our family is perfect.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's not, we don't
want to recognize it.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.361 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:29.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that this is
true in all alcoholic families?

00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if there has not been
awareness and there hasn't been

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.936 align:middle line:84%
therapy or involvement in
a 12-step program, yes.

00:04:36.936 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you mentioned in your
book here that you should have

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:84%
recognized the first signs of
your husband's alcoholism when

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
on your first meeting, he asked
you to go out and get a bottle

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.585 align:middle line:84%
of liquor for him,
and you just went.

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's normal because
I grew up in an alcoholic home.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
At the time that I met
John, everyone I knew drank.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.570 align:middle line:90%
I was drinking.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
It's normal that if you're
going to get together socially,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:90%
you have alcohol.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:90%
That was not a red flag to me.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, it would be.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It would?

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.585 align:middle line:90%
>> But this was 25 years ago.

00:05:13.585 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about that one
of the things that you then--

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.510 align:middle line:90%
you got together with John.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
You fell madly in
love with each other,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.705 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
moved in together,

00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:90%
and eventually married.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you got
on this program,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:84%
which was fascinating
to me, of what you

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:84%
referred to as magical
thinking, following

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:90%
the gurus of the world.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, John and I met at
a Buddhist seminary that was

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
given by Trungpa Rinpoche, who
was the notorious crazy wisdom

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:84%
girl who founded Naropa
University in Boulder,

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Colorado, which is a
quite well-known center

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:90%
for contemplative studies.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And he was an
outrageous alcoholic,

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and he never made any
bones about hiding it,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.090 align:middle line:90%
Trungpa Rinpoche.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So people would say,
well, yes, he drinks.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't hide it,
so what's wrong with that?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, many of us that
were attracted to him--

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and there were thousands, and
it was right about the time

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that John and I
met there was 1975.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:90%
It was like the hip place to be.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.775 align:middle line:84%
It was like a
spiritual Woodstock.

00:06:17.775 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Baba Ram Dass, and all the
beat poets and musicians,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.430 align:middle line:90%
everyone came there.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was the greatest
thing since the '60s.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:84%
He was very
charismatic, Trungpa.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And we, again, we
thought it was normal.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Hey, we came from
a drinking culture,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:90%
and now our guru drank.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:10%
And he did have a
very enlightened side.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:10%
There is no doubt about it
that the man was a genius.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.385 align:middle line:84%
But he was also a
severe alcoholic.

00:06:45.385 --> 00:06:46.745 align:middle line:90%
>> And a womanizer.

00:06:46.745 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And a terrible womanizer,
which again was accepted

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.765 align:middle line:90%
by the community as normal.

00:06:51.765 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> That was a sexual
revolution at that time.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.922 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was also
very acceptable.

00:06:55.922 --> 00:06:57.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, exactly.

00:06:57.645 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me the progression
of what happened here.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
You started following
these gurus.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.635 align:middle line:84%
You went all over the world
seeking some of them out.

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:10.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we were mostly
students of Trungpa Rinpoche's.

00:07:10.148 --> 00:07:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And then when we traveled
around the world,

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.320 align:middle line:84%
we met other gurus, other
lamas of that lineage.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:84%
But he was predominantly
the one we followed.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And again, when a child comes
from an alcoholic family,

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.630 align:middle line:84%
they're always
looking for utopia,

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:84%
because we were
used to dystopia.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're always looking for the
good mommy or the good daddy.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
these gurus set up.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:90%
They promised enlightenment.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
They say they will do it for
you as long as you give them

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:84%
your first born child, and all
your devotion, and your money.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>> And your money.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> But again, I have to
say this was 20 years ago.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.940 align:middle line:90%
This was hip.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:90%
This was the hip thing.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
This is when Mia Farrow and the
Beatles were flocking to India.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And we thought that
we were getting

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
away from the functionality
of our parents

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.573 align:middle line:84%
by following a system
that was exotic.

00:08:01.573 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And nobody over
30 was to be trusted.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:90%
And this was exotic.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.545 align:middle line:84%
Our parents couldn't
even pronounce the words

00:08:07.545 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:84%
in the language
we were learning.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So it was a rebellion against
the religion of our childhood.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:84%
But we woke up all of a
sudden, and guess what?

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:90%
We.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Were right back in the
system of our childhood

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.660 align:middle line:84%
don't talk, don't
trust, don't feel.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't talk about the guru's
drinking or womanizing,

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:90%
or you will be shunned.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And exactly the
same thing happened.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Andrew Harvey
wrote the open for your book,

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:90%
the forward.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
And one of his
greatest cries today

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:84%
is that don't trust anybody who
claims to be a teacher if they

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:84%
ask for money, if
they ask for sex,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:84%
or if they tell
you what to think.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, do you think that those
people, that type of guru,

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.535 align:middle line:84%
that type of spiritual leader,
is it still happening today?

00:09:00.535 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it absolutely
is happening.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the people that
are entrenched in those systems

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:90%
are in such denial.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want to
face the pain of having

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.960 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the
bleakness of coming

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:84%
to some understanding
of the divine

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
or what sustains you
spiritually on your own.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:84%
That's very difficult. I
mean, when my husband died,

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
it was not Buddhism
that sustained me

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:84%
through that tremendous
shock and horror of losing

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:90%
the beloved.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I was turning to this
12-step program which

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:84%
forces you to define a
higher power according

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:90%
to your understanding.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Not to scripture,
not to what you've

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:84%
been told in classes and
by the guru in lectures,

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.110 align:middle line:84%
but what through the very
darkest night, what sustains

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.686 align:middle line:90%
you, how you understand God.

00:09:55.686 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that you had
a different experience with

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:90%
alcoholism?

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Because let's face it, both
of you came from rich people,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:90%
came from the privileged class.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you had
a different experience

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.450 align:middle line:84%
with the damage of alcoholism
because of the money?

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
money, fame, nothing

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
masks the veneer of the
pain of an alcoholic family.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.432 align:middle line:84%
I think you scratch the
surface, and it's all the same.

00:10:23.432 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody comes
down to zero here.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to talk about
alcoholism and how your husband

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:84%
really got sober in a minute,
but we have to take a break.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating story, Nancy.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking to Nancy
Steinbeck about her fabulous

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.620 align:middle line:90%
book, "The Other Side of Eden."

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a compelling story.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to Nancy Steinbeck
about her fascinating book,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.910 align:middle line:10%
"The Other Side of Eden."

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Nancy.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We were talking about your
husband and the fact that

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.890 align:middle line:84%
the alcoholism is the same
no matter what strata you are

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.690 align:middle line:90%
in society.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:84%
But tell me a little bit
about one thing here.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:84%
You kept threatening
to leave him.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.030 align:middle line:84%
All through the book,
you were going to leave.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I was very conflicted
and very torn,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:84%
because he really pushed
me, as all alcoholics do.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:90%
They push you to the brink.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they terrorize.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:10%
They create tremendous
emotional stress and chaos.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
about John's inner essence

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that was so beautiful,
just such a lovely person,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:90%
that I just couldn't do it.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And I prayed that I
would have the ability.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'd ask the
kids, do you think--

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:90%
and they'd say, no, Mom.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:90%
We love him.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:90%
We just loved him.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.463 align:middle line:84%
We took him to a therapist
once, and the therapist

00:11:58.463 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
called me afterwards
and said, you know,

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I understand why
you don't leave him.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:90%
He is a really cool guy.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:10%
He said, don't let anybody
tell you you're not healthy

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:10%
because you stay.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You said one of the things
that you didn't leave him

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.646 align:middle line:84%
for was that any other man would
have bored you to death after

00:12:14.646 --> 00:12:15.446 align:middle line:90%
John.

00:12:15.446 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that
sometimes happens, yeah.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he had a
fabulous personality.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:21.660 align:middle line:90%
He really did.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:84%
He was well-read, had
tremendous eclectic knowledge

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
about all kinds of subjects,
and he was extremely funny.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And he had just had
the warmest heart.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:90%
He was just pure love.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.450 align:middle line:84%
It's that "Dr.
Jekyll, Mr. Hyde."

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.750 align:middle line:84%
You say one of the problems
with living with an alcoholic

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
is you don't know who's
going to be there today.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:10%
and that sets up a lot of
confusion, and uncertainty,

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:10%
and it's very stressful.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm very, very
confused about something.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:10%
John went in for treatment
of his alcoholism

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:10%
at least once or twice.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Three times.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Three times.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>> And it never worked.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And then toward the end of the
book, you say he joined AA.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, people in AA never want
to talk about it, you know?

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:14.065 align:middle line:84%
They have all these rules
about being anonymous.

00:13:14.065 --> 00:13:14.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:14.865 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>> But I would like to know
why does AA work when a 28-day

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.490 align:middle line:84%
in-house program
doesn't sometimes?

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what the 28 days
does is it breaks the habit,

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's impatient,
so that you are taken away from

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:84%
the social milieu or
the drinking buddies.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:84%
You're away from the
temptations, the bars,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:90%
the bottle.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And then every 28-day treatment
program has an aftercare plan.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.925 align:middle line:10%
And what they say
to do is go to AA.

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times they'll say
90 meetings in 90 days.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.840 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes, John would
go to three meetings a day.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
The responsibility is
then upon the alcoholic

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.162 align:middle line:90%
to get to those meetings.

00:13:56.162 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And when they stop
going to the meetings,

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:90%
that's when it stops working.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.190 align:middle line:84%
As long as they go to
the meetings, it works.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:84%
There is some magic
in those rooms.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:10%
There really is.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:10%
>> What happens?

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:10%
>> It's faith healing.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:84%
They learn how to get
out of their heads,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.703 align:middle line:84%
where the alcoholic is always
in this grandiose scheme of how

00:14:13.703 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:84%
he's going to live his
life-- they're always legends

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:90%
in their own minds--

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and they learn how to love
themselves in the program.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And they learn how to
turn a lot of their life

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:84%
over to the care and
understanding of their higher

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.757 align:middle line:90%
power, how they define--

00:14:29.757 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't talk
about God, do they?

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's how you define it.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Alcoholics Anonymous is
all around the world,

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.440 align:middle line:90%
so it works for any religion.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
It does not have to be Yahweh,
or Christ, or whatever.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:90%
It's how you understand it.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
it works because it

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:84%
forces you to define your
spirituality on a very

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:90%
personal level.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
about 12-step meetings

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:84%
is they really teach
you living skills.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And alcoholics are
arrested children.

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, they
are the age when

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:84%
they started drinking-- in
John's case-- or drugging.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
In John's case, he was addicted
to codeine at the age of seven.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:90%
So when I met him--

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.625 align:middle line:84%
>> His mother used
to give him codeine.

00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>> --at seven and got
him addicted to it.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.487 align:middle line:90%
>> That is so amazing.

00:15:14.487 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I know.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And so when I met him,
he was seven years old.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.175 align:middle line:84%
So he had the functioning,
the emotional,

00:15:20.175 --> 00:15:21.050 align:middle line:90%
and the life skills--

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean seven
years old in his head.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in his
heart, in his mind.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.872 align:middle line:90%
>> In the maturity.

00:15:27.872 --> 00:15:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's something
about going to meetings

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and hearing how other
people live their lives one

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
day at a time that really
helps people just hang on.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And they say the biggest
reason for relapse among men

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:90%
is the need for camaraderie.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So you see at a meaning,
you have camaraderie.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they go to meetings, and
they'll go out after, and have

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.750 align:middle line:90%
coffee, and stay up all night.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel like
drinking, someone

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.830 align:middle line:84%
will come to your house in
a heartbeat and talk to you.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And it is just a
fabulous fellowship.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's why--

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:84%
do you think it
had to do with AA

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:84%
or do you think it had
to do that he finally

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.245 align:middle line:84%
decided he was no longer
going to be an alcoholic?

00:16:03.245 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's a little bit of
both, a little bit of both but.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
But it is definitely
going to the meetings.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.555 align:middle line:84%
Just showing up for those
meetings, that's the key.

00:16:11.555 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Then you talk about that
you went to Al-Anon yourself.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and I was--

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell people what Al-Anon is.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the group for family
members who are related

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:90%
to alcoholics and addicts.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a parent,
or a husband, or a wife,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.910 align:middle line:84%
or a child of an alcoholic,
that is the place

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
to go to learn
about the disease.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And what you learn there is
if you had a relative that

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.250 align:middle line:84%
had cancer, you
would go and find out

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:90%
all you could about it.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And in Al-Anon,
you're urged to learn

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.000 align:middle line:84%
all you can about the
disease of alcoholism,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:90%
that it is a disease.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And they have all
these great slogans

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:84%
that promote compassion
for the alcoholic

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and allow the spouse
or the family member

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to detach from the rage, and
the anger, and the heartbreak.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So they'll say things
like detach with love.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
Hate the disease,
not love the person.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So you can hate the
disease of alcoholism,

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:84%
but it still allows
you to love the person.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important to
understand that alcoholism

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.530 align:middle line:90%
is a mental disease.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:90%
It's also a physical disease.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:84%
But the component of
the spiritual bankruptcy

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that
these people can

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:84%
be so heartless and
cruel in one moment,

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:90%
and so loving, and so charming--

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The "Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde"--

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>> --theory.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:10%
>> At the same time, you have
to learn how to deal with that,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:10%
because living with an alcoholic
is like living in a war zone.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.100 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
difficult, as it would

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:84%
be if you lived with a person
who had Alzheimer's or cancer.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.425 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult
living with disease.

00:17:49.425 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It's constantly waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Constant vigilance,
hyper vigilance, I call it.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me
about yourself now.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Are you glad now that
you didn't leave him?

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I really am, because
those last three years

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:90%
of sobriety were so rewarding.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:84%
It was so wonderful
for us to see him

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
as we really knew
he was, and to see

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.627 align:middle line:84%
him get back his creativity,
and his brilliance.

00:18:17.627 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was always brilliant.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.760 align:middle line:90%
He was a genius.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:84%
But to see that really be
put into action and the way

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.060 align:middle line:84%
he wrote so
beautifully, absolutely.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:90%
It was a true victory.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was worth all
the pain of the journey.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much, yes.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And also, you just
can't sit there

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:84%
while I'm Pollyanna and
related to an alcoholic.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.240 align:middle line:90%
I had to look--

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:84%
the relationship forced
me to look at what

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:47.810 align:middle line:84%
qualities in myself, why I was
attracted to him, why I stayed.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And it forced me to
really face myself.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So I really got to know
myself, and I don't think you

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.985 align:middle line:84%
can be given a better gift,
a greater gift than that.

00:18:56.985 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>> What does his family
think about this book?

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they are upset
about it because no one--

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.640 align:middle line:90%
and it's understandable.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
They really don't want that side
of Steinbeck, the dark side.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So it comes back
to the three rules.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't tell.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Don't trust.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't feel.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
propagate the myth

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
that Steinbeck was this
wonderful compassionate

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:84%
man, the conscience of
America, which he was known as.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:90%
And yes, he had that in him.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.980 align:middle line:90%
But he also had a dark side.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people that we need
to celebrate his dark side,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:84%
because he is known as the
master of the human condition.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And where did he
come up with that?

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't pull
those kinds of characters

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:84%
like "Of Mice and
Men" George shooting

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Lenny unless you have a darkness
in you, a depth to your soul.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Or you have had a
lot of pain yourself.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:46.055 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, he must've
had a lot of mental pain,

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.325 align:middle line:90%
a lot of heartbreak--

00:19:49.325 --> 00:19:50.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:50.125 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>> --that he probably
put into his novel.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and we should
celebrate that.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And as Andrew Harvey
says in the introduction,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:84%
it should cause us
to have more sympathy

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:90%
for the man as a writer.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.330 align:middle line:90%
Again, we want to look at gurus.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:90%
We want these myths.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:90%
The guru will do it for us.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Steinbeck is a great man.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And Johnny had this montage
just when he was growing up,

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:84%
just because a man is a great
writer and a Nobel Prize winner

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
does not mean he's
a great father.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Why do we expect
this of our figures?

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> They have to be everything.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Because we're children.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.255 align:middle line:90%
They have to be everything.

00:20:24.255 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:90%
They have to be perfection.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
important for us now

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:84%
to understand that there is
no perfection in humanity.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:90%
We're human beings.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:90%
We've got shadow sides.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Does the family feel
friendly toward you still?

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:90%
No, and there was--

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Because of the book?

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And there was
animosity between John

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and Steinbeck's third wife when
he was alive, because they knew

Johnny was the truth teller.

00:20:58.151 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So they weren't too
happy to have this come out.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:84%

them not accepting it?

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not surprised.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
It fits into the whole
dysfunctional system,

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.325 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:21:12.325 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, you've had
a lot of experience

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:84%
not only with a husband and
his family who is alcoholic,

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:90%
but also in your family.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You've had terrible
abuse in your family.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:84%
What would you say
to someone out there

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:84%
who may not come
from a famous family,

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:84%
but who has suffered
like you have suffered,

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:90%
like your husband has suffered?

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.262 align:middle line:90%
What advice would you give them?

00:21:41.262 --> 00:21:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Get therapy.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Do as much self-help
reading as you can.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:84%

meetings, because there

for all kinds of people.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't just have to be
related to an alcoholic.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.140 align:middle line:90%
And do work on yourself.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And find out where
this started and how

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:90%
it can stop, because it can.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.705 align:middle line:90%
It really can.

00:22:02.705 --> 00:22:05.205 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you want to do with
the rest of your life, Nancy?

00:22:05.205 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:90%

>> You live a very quiet life
now after this very hectic

>> Yeah.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you like it?

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I like it now.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But I also enjoy traveling
and meeting people,

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and the book has been
a marvelous opportunity

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.435 align:middle line:90%
to do that.
