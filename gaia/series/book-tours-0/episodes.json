The high amount of protein consumed when on the Atkins diet, for example, puts tremendous strain on the liver and kidneys over the long term. Carbohydrate sensitivity should be addressed by identifying the different types and how they work for you, since carbohydrates themselves are not the enemy. Portion size and how often you eat are just as important as what you eat. \r\n\r\nAnd of course, nothing beats walking after a meal.
