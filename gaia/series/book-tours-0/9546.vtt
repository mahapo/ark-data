00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.040 align:middle line:10%
>> This is Book Tours
and I'm Corinne Edwards.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.670 align:middle line:10%
I'd like you to meet two of
the most important messengers

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:10%
in publishing today.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Important because the
authors on this show

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:84%
are dedicated to helping
your personal growth,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:84%
to make you happier, healthier,
to be the best you can be.

Wisdom Television is
privileged to welcome

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
rocket scientists
Dr. John Brandenburg

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and Monica Rix Paxson, authors
of "Dead Mars, Dying Earth".

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Is Mars dead?

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:90%
And if so, do we care?

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Brandenburg and
Monica Rix Paxson,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:84%
authors of "Dead Mars, Dying
Earth" say we'd better,

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
we are well on our way to
Earth meeting the same fate.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.860 align:middle line:84%
What does Mars have
to do with us, John?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Mars is an exhibit of
how this planet could end up

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.530 align:middle line:84%
in the future if we don't
take better care of it.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Mars apparently
was a planet that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:84%
had a thriving
biosphere in the past.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the extent
of that biosphere.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
far it advanced.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
We do know, however, that the
present conditions on Mars

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
mean that only a small shadow
of that former biosphere

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:90%
can exist on Mars now.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.020 align:middle line:84%
It appears a large
asteroid struck it.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>> We know Mars once had an
ocean that was larger than

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
the Pacific, and it
once had an atmosphere,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
and it once had life,
and they're all gone.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is our nearest neighbor
so it's an important lesson

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:90%
for our own planet.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, people are very
fascinated with the idea

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:90%
of life on other planets.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that we are pretty
proud in saying that we are

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:90%
the only life in the universe?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Do you think there is life?

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm convinced that there is
life elsewhere in the universe.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.060 align:middle line:84%
To me, the Earth is a very
typical place in the universe.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:84%
We are very lucky
to be here, though.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where life
can thrive, and in fact,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:84%
shapes the environment,
particularly our oxygen

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.690 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere,
the ozone layer.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So that we would expect it
elsewhere in the universe,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.040 align:middle line:90%
we would find similar planets.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Mars may have, in fact,
been a similar planet

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:90%
to this one in the past.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Which planet do you
think might have life on it?

00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I think there is
certainly life on Mars now.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Now?

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Just the infamous
primitive bacteria--

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>> --that could survive
under the harsh conditions.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.270 align:middle line:84%
They find life in
places they thought

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:84%
were impossible
for things to live

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.380 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, miles
below the surface,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
nuclear reactors,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
in places, deserts in
Antarctica that resemble Mars.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:90%
So I think there will be--

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:84%
they will find that there is
bacterial life on Mars now.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>> But that doesn't
impress people.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Bacterial life, what about
people walking around?

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.685 align:middle line:84%
What about these UFO people that
come-- the little blue people?

00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we really are beginning
to look at what the history

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.610 align:middle line:90%
of Mars is.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And it may have included
intelligent life of some sort.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.460 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly had a similar
history to the Earth.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a warm, wet planet,
life could have evolved there.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And we see some evidence of
some very interesting things

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
on Mars, things that we
wouldn't have expected to see,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
things that look very
geometric, that looked fairly

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.795 align:middle line:90%
sculptural or architectural.

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Pyramids?

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And pyramids, for example.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And we feel that it's an
important place for us

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
to continue to explore
and it is an open question

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.835 align:middle line:84%
as to how long life was on
Mars and how evolved it became.

00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:12.435 align:middle line:84%
>> So what do you think
happened to Mars that killed it?

00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It appears a large
asteroid hit it.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:84%
We presented a hypothesis at
several scientific conventions

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.880 align:middle line:84%
on the idea of an unstable
greenhouse on Mars

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:90%
creating Earth-like conditions.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Mars needed a greenhouse to
have Earth-like conditions.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.010 align:middle line:84%
However, Carl Sagan
was the first one

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
to find out that such
a greenhouse would

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
have been unstable to like a
large asteroid striking Mars.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
That would collapse
the greenhouse.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.790 align:middle line:84%
The greenhouse gas,
carbon dioxide,

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:84%
would freeze out in the
dry ice on the surface.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:84%
The greenhouse would collapse
and not be able to recover.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's how we lost
our dinosaurs, isn't it?

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.845 align:middle line:90%
Probably?

00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.225 align:middle line:90%
>> According to the theory.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was very similar.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Here on this planet,
we were struck

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.030 align:middle line:84%
by an asteroid or a
meteorite in the Chicxulub

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:84%
region of the Yucatan
65 million years ago.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And it did, it reduced life
greatly on this planet.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:10%
We were a large enough planet
and close enough to the Sun

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:10%
that we eventually recovered.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.285 align:middle line:10%
Mars did not.

00:05:15.285 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Is Mars smaller than we are?

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> About half the size.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Half the size.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So that if a very
big asteroid hit us,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.185 align:middle line:84%
we could have the
same thing happen?

00:05:26.185 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Something the size that
wiped out the dinosaurs,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:84%
if it struck the planet again,
would certainly cause damage

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that we would not be able
to recover from for probably

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:90%
a million years.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.187 align:middle line:84%
Humanity might
disappear, unless steps

00:05:43.187 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:90%
are taken to prevent that.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>> These are important risks.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we don't
even need a meteorite

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.060 align:middle line:90%
to cause problems here on Earth.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We're doing it
ourselves, right?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>> We are actually generating
some of the same kinds

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
of effects that you might have
from that kind of strike with

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
our own use of fossil fuels
and increasing greenhouse gases

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:90%
in our own atmosphere.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So we have a problem
and the problem

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
is we don't have to wait
to be hit by something

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:90%
to have a problem.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
We have a problem
now and we're seeing

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.867 align:middle line:84%
some of the results of that
problem just even today.

00:06:19.867 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, one of the points you
made in your book that was

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
interesting to me was
that our atmosphere,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
which is being destroyed
by the carbon monoxide that

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:84%
we're generating actually
keeps the asteroids away

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.333 align:middle line:90%
and the comets away.

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:36.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I never knew that.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It functions kind of as a
bullet proof vest for a lot

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:90%
of debris.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It deflects it?

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it deflects it or
burns up the smaller pieces.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, though, one is
large enough and it gets through

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.350 align:middle line:10%
and we've had--

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:10%
we have the big meteorite
crater in Arizona.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.460 align:middle line:10%
We have the Tunguska
Event in Siberia,

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:10%
and several more
recent near misses

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:10%
that show that this
could happen at any time.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So the people who are
sitting back and saying, "Well,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to worry
about this stuff.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:84%
That's going to happen two
million years from now."

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:84%
The very fact that we're
destroying this layer leaves us

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
open for something that we
cannot possibly defend against,

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:90%
a meteorite or a comet fittings.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're doing to the
Earth makes it more vulnerable

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.300 align:middle line:90%
to the damage that would--

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:84%
these things would pile
up on top of each other.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it's also a
situation where we're evolving

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
as human beings and we will
continue to evolve provided we

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:90%
survive.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have become space-fearing
people and citizens

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:90%
of the cosmos, really.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you become citizens
of the cosmos, a citizen

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.955 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, you suddenly
are responsible for your home

00:07:50.955 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
world in a way that you've
never perhaps been before.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, we have
to prepare and be

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:84%
aware of our atmosphere, our
oceans, and potential things

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:84%
that might strike
us from outside.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a word that
everybody talks about.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to explain
exactly what it means--

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:90%
global warming.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.575 align:middle line:84%
Let's start from A,
what is global warming?

00:08:15.575 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Global warming is the
build-up of CO2 and other gases

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:84%
that tend to trap
infrared radiation

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.530 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth's atmosphere,
above levels that they have been

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.930 align:middle line:90%
historically.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Some of this may be some natural
trend that we don't understand,

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.825 align:middle line:84%
but however, the dominant effect
for raising the carbon dioxide

00:08:37.825 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
level in the Earth's
atmosphere appears

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to be human use of fossil
fuels, which gives us

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
our civilization, our cars, our
televisions, our electricity.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So this build-up
of carbon dioxide

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
is changing the way the Earth's
environment accepts and rejects

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:90%
heat.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.050 align:middle line:84%
We have the example of Venus
in our own solar system that

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:84%
has an overwhelming greenhouse,
and the temperatures

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.620 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of Venus are
close to the melting point

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:90%
of lead.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:10%
It's absolutely a hellish
place, and it's much hotter

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:10%
than it would be if
it had no atmosphere.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:10%
Then, of course,
we have the Earth

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:10%
and we're raising
the level of carbon

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.970 align:middle line:10%
dioxide in the atmosphere so
that it will trap more heat.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the methods of using
carbon dioxide in industrial

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.140 align:middle line:84%
use to make CO2 lasers,
these are infrared lasers.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.130 align:middle line:90%
They're very powerful.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
They're used for cutting
thick pieces of steel.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Infrared radiation and carbon
dioxide love each other.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you raise that, change
that level in the Earth's

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.500 align:middle line:84%
atmosphere, you affect
how it processes heat,

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
just like changing the
thermostat on your house

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:90%
and your living room.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So coming back to it,
let's talk about the Midwest

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
of Chicago because we're taping
this in Chicago, Midwest area.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:84%
We had in February, almost
80-degree weather here.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, and two
summers ago, we had

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:90%
heat of 121 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Is this because of
this global warming?

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.232 align:middle line:90%
Is this what causing it?

00:10:17.232 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I hate to say it, but global
warming is not going to mean

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.510 align:middle line:84%
just a gradual raising
of temperatures.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.505 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
killer heat waves.

00:10:25.505 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Wait a minute, this is really
serious and we want to hear

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:90%
more about this.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.650 align:middle line:84%
We're talking to John
Brandenburg and Monica Rix

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Paxson about this very,
very interesting book--

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.390 align:middle line:90%
it reads like a novel--

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
called "Dead Mars, Dying Earth".

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:90%
You want to miss any of this.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to John
Brandenburg and Monica Rix

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:10%
Paxson about their book
"Dead Mars, Dying Earth".

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And we ended our last segment
with some really sad things

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that you were talking about,
that this global warming

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.215 align:middle line:90%
is actually causing disease.

00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>> It's causing tropical
diseases to move north

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.860 align:middle line:90%
into temperate regions.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.245 align:middle line:84%
Like New York City had an
outbreak of Nile encephalitis.

00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:23.860 align:middle line:84%
It was because a West
Nile mosquito suddenly

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:90%
moved in to New York City.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Normally, a cold winter
would kill this mosquito

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
because it's used
to the tropics.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:84%
However, the winter
was too mild,

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:90%
the mosquitoes are still around.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
They've now appeared in
my home state of Virginia,

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.052 align:middle line:90%
near Washington DC.

00:11:40.052 --> 00:11:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is no longer
something we can just look

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:90%
at for the future?

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Here in Chicago, you lost
800 people in-- what is it--

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:84%
three days to a
killer heat wave.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.400 align:middle line:84%
That is the face of global
warming we're going to see.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>> In '98, 5% of the world's
population were displaced from

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:84%
their homes at one
period of time or another

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:90%
because of climatic problems.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's really affecting us now.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.840 align:middle line:90%
We're just seeing the beginning.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:84%
As the carbon increases,
we'll continue

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:84%
to see more unless we
turn this problem around.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I think that
this is a very important book

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:84%
because I think most
people, including myself,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:84%
think that this is
something that is way,

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
way out in the future and
we've got plenty of time to do

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.043 align:middle line:90%
something about it.

00:12:34.043 --> 00:12:35.460 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
the time is now.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Time is now.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.653 align:middle line:90%
>> What can we do?

00:12:37.653 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:84%
What's the first thing
to be done, John?

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we proposed a 10-point
plan to start action now,

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle line:90%
to change this course we are on.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:10%
The first thing we can do
is revive the fusion energy

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:10%
program we had in this country.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:10%
We passed a fusion energy,
Magnetic Fusion Energy

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:10%
Engineering Act in
1980, President Carter.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:84%
It was going to give us fusion
energy in 10 years, power

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:90%
into the grid.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.215 align:middle line:84%
Fusion is a much
safer, cleaner form--

00:13:04.215 --> 00:13:05.015 align:middle line:90%
>> What is it?

00:13:05.015 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Fusion is the nuclear process
that gives light to the stars

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:90%
and the sun.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:84%
It is the process that
allows the universe

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
to have warmth and
light and life.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
natural energy cycle.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's very different than
the kind of nuclear energy that

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:84%
we're using now, which is unsafe
and produces long-term waste

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:84%
that are extremely
hard to deal with.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is a much safer,
much more natural form

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear energy, and one of
the keystones of our proposal.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
We also are proposing that we
actually exchange debt or pay

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:84%
rainforest nations
to produce trees.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they don't
have any incentive

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:90%
to keep the rainforest intact.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.710 align:middle line:84%
These are poor people,
they need to farm,

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.700 align:middle line:84%
they tear down the rainforest
in order to have farmland.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
But if we actually generated
another motivation for them

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:84%
to keep the rainforest
standing to plant trees

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and maintain them, we
would be better off.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:84%
We have a number of other
solutions, many of which

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.790 align:middle line:84%
your viewers can begin to
take action on right away.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
One level is we need
to begin to demand

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:90%
that our leadership lead us.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:10%
We need to tell our
leaders to lead us

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:10%
in the instance
of global warming.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.290 align:middle line:10%
This is a planetary
problem we need leadership.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>> What's blocking it?

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> We have an opportunity right
now because this country has

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.970 align:middle line:84%
had no energy policy since 1980
because of the oil glut that

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:84%
occurred in the Middle East when
Iran and Iraq began their war

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't need to
think about energy.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:84%
It was just like turning
on water on the tap.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have an opportunity
with OPEC price increases

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
to actually address the problem
of energy and global warming.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
We need appropriate
energy sources.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.992 align:middle line:84%
And if we can use solar and
wind to the maximum that we can

00:15:06.992 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:84%
because those are available
right now, if we develop,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:84%
we reinvigorate, we revive
the 10-year program to harness

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
fusion power so we have cleaner,
safer energy in massive amounts

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.820 align:middle line:84%
for the future and we
electrify the cars,

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.765 align:middle line:84%
and we replant the rainforests,
then this great tragedy--

00:15:26.765 --> 00:15:27.965 align:middle line:90%
>> We can save the Earth.

00:15:27.965 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we can.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you begin
to face a problem,

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:84%
then all sorts of creative
resources become available

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.080 align:middle line:90%
to solve it.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
We've solved other
horrific problems here

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.130 align:middle line:90%
on this planet, the dust bowl.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.040 align:middle line:90%
We've gotten a man on the moon.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:90%
We can solve this one too.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>> But what does the
ordinary person do here?

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting there thinking,
"oh my god, this is terrible.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?"

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they make
choices all the time.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
When they buy a
vehicle, they can

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.370 align:middle line:90%
buy more fuel-efficient one.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:01.460 align:middle line:84%
When they buy an appliance, they
can look for fuel-efficiency

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:90%
as part of the package.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.390 align:middle line:84%
They can also
insulate their homes,

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:84%
begin to implement
solar energy if that's

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:90%
a possibility for them.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Fuel cell driven
vehicles are coming

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.820 align:middle line:84%
online in the next two
or three four years.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:84%
We can be receptive
to that as consumers

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and buy the kinds
of things that are

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:90%
going to produce less carbon.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But we can also
support an initiative

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
to end global warming
by asking our Congress

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:84%
people to support the
passing of the Kyoto Accord.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:40.925 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that?

00:16:40.925 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>> That is an international
effort to use a rational

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and just approach to solving
the problem of global warming,

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and it asks for countries
to reduce to a certain limit

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:84%
the amount of carbon
that they're putting

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:90%
into the atmosphere.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's not perfect
and nothing is perfect

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:11.270 align:middle line:84%
but it is an equitable
and an initial step

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:90%
that people can take right now.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:84%
As well as voting for the
kinds of representation

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
that we'll have that
treats global warming

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:90%
as a serious problem.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>> What has stopped the process?

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:90%
The glut of oil?

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the glut of oil, but
also the fact that people think

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:90%
they are helpless.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.553 align:middle line:84%
They don't think
they have options.

00:17:35.553 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Part of what we tried
to do in this book

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
is help people face the problem
squarely without flinching,

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
but also face their
options squarely.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:84%
They have options they
don't know that they have.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Many people feel like the
choice is between an environment

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:90%
or an economy.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And basically, that
isn't a choice.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.540 align:middle line:84%
What we have to do is
environmental policy

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.850 align:middle line:84%
that helps the economy
continue to grow and provide

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:84%
employment, not
only for ourselves

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.010 align:middle line:90%
but the rest of the world.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.840 align:middle line:84%
We also need economic
policies, energy policies

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.585 align:middle line:84%
that bring us more in
tune with the environment,

00:18:08.585 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:90%
not fight against it.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The only frightening thing
here is that you talked about

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
the lack of oxygen now on the
air and the children who are--

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.560 align:middle line:84%
so many more children have
asthma now than ever before.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> There really is a
worldwide epidemic of asthma.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit of a mystery
why this is happening.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:84%
They do know that air
quality is one of the factors

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and they've identified a number
of gases that are a problem.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Of course, oxygen is
going down on our planet.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:84%
We don't think that that's
directly a factor in asthma

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:90%
because it's such a small part.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Real tiny, tiny.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Tiny part.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.350 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
this is one, it's

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
a red light going off
on your dashboard.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.560 align:middle line:84%
It's really the planet's way
of telling us that things

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.780 align:middle line:90%
are trending in a bad way.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:84%
They are going in
a direction that we

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:84%
need to take the car into
the shop and get it fixed

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:84%
or will cause more serious
and permanent damage.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for years, we've been
hearing about electric cars

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.525 align:middle line:84%
and they show them
at auto shows.

00:19:09.525 --> 00:19:10.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:10.325 --> 00:19:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> But nothing happens.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they're expensive
and part of it is,

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:84%
is until they can have
production lines that are

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.923 align:middle line:84%
producing electric
cars all the time,

00:19:19.923 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and people are buying
them all the time,

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.840 align:middle line:90%
the cost will not come down.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Also, we have to develop
some infrastructures.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, all of
our houses are already

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:29.930 align:middle line:90%
wired for electricity.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.820 align:middle line:84%
The gas stations
could also convert

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:84%
to supplying electricity
instead of gasoline.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.435 align:middle line:84%
But there's some
reorganization that we have to,

00:19:38.435 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:84%
to make an electric
car friendly society.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>> It also is going
to be up to consumers.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:10%
When we discovered that
the SFCs were creating

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:10%
a hole in the ozone layer,
there was a consumer movement

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:10%
along with scientists to stop
buying aerosol spray cans.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So when consumers
begin to actually look

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:06.350 align:middle line:84%
at what their vehicles
are costing them

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the future
for their children

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and begin to have alternatives
that are realistically

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.602 align:middle line:84%
available to them, I think
people will do the right thing.

00:20:15.602 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think especially
if they realize that these

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
problems are directly affecting
our generation, our children,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.620 align:middle line:84%
our grandchildren, and not some
future generation that let them

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:90%
worry about it.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> This isn't something that's
going to happen 100 years from

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
happening right now.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.710 align:middle line:84%
We are going to see more
flooding, more hurricanes, more

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:84%
tornadoes, more tropical
diseases, more droughts

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:90%
as a result of global warming.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that will
affect our insurance rates,

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:84%
it will affect our
economies, it will--

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:84%
it is potentially
very catastrophic

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:84%
for individuals and
certainly for a whole planet.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So everyone needs to know
that the choices that they

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.595 align:middle line:84%
make, the people that they
vote for make a difference.

00:21:04.595 --> 00:21:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And they should be
asking these questions.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:08.442 --> 00:21:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What are you going to
do about the environment?

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> By reducing our
dependence on foreign oil,

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.910 align:middle line:84%
we'll increase our security
of our economy and also

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.300 align:middle line:90%
our national security.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to have
to go to war again

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.993 align:middle line:84%
over oil supplies that are
coming from across the ocean.

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It would be much better
to have energy sources

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.240 align:middle line:84%
here in this country supplying
most of our energy needs.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
if we get a few--

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:84%
more hurricane
Andrews in Florida

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and the Gulf states
and the South Atlantic

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:84%
states, this will have
disastrous consequences

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.260 align:middle line:90%
for the economy.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:10%
Last hurricane season,
we had enormous category

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.950 align:middle line:10%
5 storm, strongest storm they've
ever-- one of the strongest

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:10%
storms we've ever seen
heading toward Florida.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Three million people
were evacuating,

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:84%
they're moving along the
highway at three miles an hour

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:90%
trying to escape this storm.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.490 align:middle line:84%
The storm was advancing
at 12 miles an hour.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
By some miracle,
and a lot of people

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.990 align:middle line:84%
must have been praying
because a cold front

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:84%
arrived and deflected
the hurricane.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.840 align:middle line:84%
It hit North Carolina-- it
did a glancing blow in North

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Carolina, but North Carolina
had two brushes with hurricanes

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
this last year, had
tremendous damage.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> In about 30 seconds, can we
serve and can we say our Earth?

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>> We absolutely can.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We can absolutely pull
together and take the kind

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.455 align:middle line:84%
of steps that are necessary
to solve this problem.

00:22:37.455 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I wish we had a lot
more time to talk about this

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:84%
book because it's so
extensive and chilling.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I think it's such
an important book

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's written
in such a manner

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.130 align:middle line:84%
that people will read it
because it's like a novel.
