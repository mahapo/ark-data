00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:84%
At last, a book about
eating, and eating well,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:90%
for health and pleasure.

Andrew Weil, author of "Eating
Well for Optimum Health,"

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
is the brilliantly innovative
and greatly respected

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.870 align:middle line:84%
doctor who has changed
the way the world thinks

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:90%
about health and eating.

Andrew--

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.997 align:middle line:90%
>> --welcome back to--

00:01:01.997 --> 00:01:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>> --Wisdom Television.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.515 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure
to have you here.

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:08.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of
the things that I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:84%
think is so important
about your book

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:84%
is that we have forgotten
about food being a pleasure.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.780 align:middle line:10%
>> I think a real problem in
this culture is that people

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.300 align:middle line:10%
make an opposition between
healthy food and delicious

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:10%
food, and think that, if
you want to be healthy,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:10%
you have to give up
everything you know like.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.080 align:middle line:84%
One of my purposes is to show
people that that's not true,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:84%
that it's perfectly possible
to design a diet and eating

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:84%
plan that provides all the
pleasure you want from food

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and also conforms to ideas of
good health and good nutrition.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Another point you make is
that eating is very important,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
never mind just to
nourish our bodies,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:90%
but as a social pastime.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The word companion comes
from the Latin root for bread.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:84%
A companion is somebody
you share bread with.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a
fundamental human bond.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I think the way
you eat also helps

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:84%
define your individual
and cultural identity.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, Muslims don't eat
pork, Hindus don't eat meat,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
we eat certain foods
on certain days.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:90%
This is part of your identity.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I think if you go off on a
way of eating because somebody

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.910 align:middle line:84%
tells you so or you read
something in a book that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
separates you from other
people or from your culture,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
it sabotages that important
purpose of eating.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think it's healthier
to eat with someone than alone?

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I think both are fine, but
I think that the act of eating

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:84%
with somebody is one of the most
pleasurable activities that we

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, to share time around
the consumption of food,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:84%
or preparation and
consumption of food,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.865 align:middle line:84%
I think this is time
very well spent.

00:02:47.865 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that's
interesting about your book--

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're a very
important doctor--

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
is that you have your own
personal recipes here.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I like to cook.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I really learned to cook
when I was in medical school.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:84%
I found that when I
came home from working

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:84%
long shifts in
hospitals, I would

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
be in such terrible
states of mind.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that
cooking, making food

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:84%
put me back in a
good mental state.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:84%
It made order, it cleared my
mind, it focused my attention.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And cooking has always
served me that way.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.723 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of
meditation that I do.

00:03:19.723 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:90%
It makes me feel good.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I like making good
food for other people.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I invent recipes.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:90%
I test recipes.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I get very frustrated with
recipes that don't work.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And I really don't use
cookbooks except to get ideas,

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.907 align:middle line:90%
but then I do things on my own.

00:03:34.907 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I love being able to
go to a strange kitchen

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and working with whatever's
there to turn out a good meal.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
But I've come to really
like recipes that are quick,

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.860 align:middle line:84%
easy, that don't use a lot
of strange ingredients,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and that give
really good results,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.630 align:middle line:84%
both in terms of being tasty
and in terms of being healthy.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>> What's your favorite spice?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a hard one.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, I love red pepper.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.578 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I like chili peppers.

00:03:56.578 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:84%
I love garlic, which I think
is incredibly healthful.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
spices is allspice.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a terrific one.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's great.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:84%
It's great in beans and lentil
soup, anything with squash.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:90%
It gives a wonderful rich taste.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, there are a lot
of people who are watching this

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:90%
show who live alone.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And they find
themselves coming home,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and they get a Weight
Watchers dinner or something,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
or they have
cornflakes and milk.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm aware.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Here's a couple suggestions.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:84%
One is I would like people
to try some of these recipes,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
because they really
are quick and easy.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think that just to see
that food preparation doesn't

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:90%
have to be an ordeal.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But failing that, there are more
and more healthy convenience

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:90%
foods available.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
If you go to one of
these good natural foods

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.810 align:middle line:84%
supermarkets that are opening
up around the country,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and just look through the frozen
food sections or the meals

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.212 align:middle line:84%
in a cup that you just
add boiling water to,

00:04:54.212 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:84%
these are some good
products there.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
You need to read
labels to make sure

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that there are
healthy ingredients,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
but more and more, there are
these healthy convenience

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.250 align:middle line:84%
foods that may work for
people in that situation.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>> You said in the book
that the shorter the amount

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:84%
of ingredients that
are on the label--

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>> The better.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>> --the better.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And also, a good strategy
is think about, you know,

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.448 align:middle line:84%
like let's say you get an
instant cup of corn chowder.

00:05:21.448 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, you just add
boiling water to it.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, think about if you
made corn chowder, what

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.570 align:middle line:90%
would go into it at home.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Would it be maybe
corn and onions

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some red pepper,
maybe milk, maybe some olive oil

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:90%
or butter.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:90%
That's about it.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.383 align:middle line:84%
If there's a paragraph
of ingredients there,

00:05:39.383 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:84%
that's probably not
something you want to buy.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.002 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just see how closely
these products resemble

00:05:44.002 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:84%
what you would do if you were
actually making that at home.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, then the other
thing they do is they say,

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
well, first I'll sit down, I'll
have a little glass of wine,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.942 align:middle line:90%
which you say is fine.

00:05:52.942 --> 00:05:54.525 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's
fine in moderation--

00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's wonderful--

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>> --yeah.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> --to have a
drink before dinner.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And for a snack, I'll have a
bag of this new product that

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.463 align:middle line:90%
says it has no fat at all.

00:06:06.463 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Olestra, is that
what it's called?

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --potato chips, because
potatoes are good for me.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:90%
I'll get vitamin C.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably this new fake
fat that's not absorbed,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I think the only thing it's
going to do is to increase

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.070 align:middle line:84%
consumption of very low-quality
foods that are not very

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:84%
nutritious, that will promote
weight gain in many people.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that this is going
to help anyone lose weight.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to
encourage people

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
to consume more and snack more
on low-quality carbohydrate

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.240 align:middle line:84%
foods that are just the
worst thing you want to eat

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:90%
if you're prone to weight gain.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>> But what about the Olestra?

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.197 align:middle line:84%
Is that a bad
product in general?

00:06:43.197 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think,
in itself, it's bad.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's going to
cause intestinal upsets

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.890 align:middle line:84%
in some people, and
it blocks absorption

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.147 align:middle line:90%
of fat-soluble vitamins.

00:06:50.147 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
I think the main problem
with it, as I said,

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.050 align:middle line:84%
it's going to
increase consumption

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:90%
of low-quality foods.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:84%
That will probably
worsen people's situation

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:90%
in terms of weight.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.618 align:middle line:84%
>> On your never-never
list is margarine.

00:07:01.618 --> 00:07:03.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't put Olestra
in the same category.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I think margarine is worse
because the fats have

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
been chemically altered
in ways that are probably

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:90%
very unhealthy for us.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.222 align:middle line:84%
I think if it comes to a choice
between butter and margarine,

00:07:12.222 --> 00:07:13.223 align:middle line:90%
you take butter.

00:07:13.223 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I would prefer that
people don't use anything,

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:84%
or they use olive oil,
but definitely won't

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
eat margarine or all of these
related partially hydrogenated

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
oils, which are
now in everything.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, in all commercial
baked goods-- crackers,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:90%
cookies--

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.172 align:middle line:84%
it's all partially
hydrogenated fat.

00:07:29.172 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> What does that mean,
partially hydrogenated?

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:10%
>> It means that the
fat has been heated,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.870 align:middle line:10%
liquid oils have been heated
to very high temperatures

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:10%
and reacted with hydrogen gas in
the presence of metal catalysts

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.210 align:middle line:10%
in order to convert the oils
to semi-solid forms that have

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.780 align:middle line:10%
longer shelf life and better
baking characteristics.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:90%
Manufacturers love this.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But in the process
of doing this,

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
the molecules that make
up oils are damaged.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:84%
They're changed
from natural forms

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:84%
into new forms that are
damaging to our hearts

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and arteries, that promote
cancer and probably

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:90%
throat inflammation.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is unhealthy
stuff to put in the body.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>> What about people who,
no matter what they eat,

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:84%
they still have a high
cholesterol count?

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> In some people, this
is determined genetically,

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's relatively
independent of diet.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.835 align:middle line:84%
There are still some natural
strategies you can try.

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
You can try eating garlic,
which helps lower cholesterol.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.990 align:middle line:90%
You can try eating hot peppers.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.550 align:middle line:84%
You can try eating shiitake
mushrooms, green tea.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't work, you
could try niacin, a B vitamin,

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:84%
which probably should be used
under medical supervision.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:84%
There's a product
called Cholestin,

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:84%
which is a red
yeast extract that's

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:84%
available widely without
prescription that works.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.919 align:middle line:84%
And if all else
fails, you can go

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:84%
in one of the
cholesterol-lowering drugs.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they dangerous?

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> They may disturb
liver function.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they're benign.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Also, I think lowering
cholesterol is not

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:84%
necessarily the
only thing you need

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:90%
to do to avoid heart trouble.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've put all our attention
on cholesterol, but just

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
as an example, there's more
and more people in medicine who

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:84%
think that the underlying
problem in coronary heart

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.780 align:middle line:84%
disease is not so much
cholesterol as inflammation,

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that this is an inflammatory
disorder of arteries.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And it may even be that the
cholesterol deposits are

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
an attempt of the body to plug
up defects in arteries caused

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.090 align:middle line:90%
by inflammation.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is a new
concept that's emerging.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.703 align:middle line:84%
And the mainstream American
diet promotes inflammation,

00:09:27.703 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:84%
mostly because of the kinds
of fats that people eat,

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:84%
including these partially
hydrogenated fats

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:90%
and refined vegetable oils.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
The omega 3 fatty acids that are
in some fish and nuts and seeds

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and soy products have
the opposite effect.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:90%
They retard inflammation.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was a kid, my mother
was way ahead of her time,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:90%
and she gave us vitamins.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it was just-- nobody
had heard about vitamins.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.470 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
we took every single day

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:90%
was a little--

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't even see them anymore--
it was a little fish oil--

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Cod liver oil.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>> --cod liver oil
in a little capsule.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.160 align:middle line:90%
We used to call them footballs.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember them.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I remember
being given liquid cod

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:90%
liver oil that I hated.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:90%
But this was--

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.428 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't see that
around anymore.

00:10:08.428 --> 00:10:11.002 align:middle line:84%
>> --this was a source of
these essential fatty acids.

00:10:11.002 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think we should
find those footballs again?

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's
better sources now.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think that cod liver
oil is not necessarily the best

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:90%
way to get this.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it's better to
eat salmon or sardines,

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:90%
or you can take--

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
there are capsules
of fish oils that

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:84%
are different-- not
from cod livers,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.770 align:middle line:84%
but that might be better,
cleaner sources of them.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:90%
But there was some wisdom there.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%

We're talking to
Dr. Andrew Weil,

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Andrew, you came out with
several books before this one.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
"Spontaneous Healing"
sold millions and millions

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:90%
of copies.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.122 align:middle line:90%
And your "Eight Steps To--"

00:11:11.122 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> "Eight Weeks to
Optimum Health."

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>> "Eight Weeks to
Optimum Health,"

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that was an
important book to me.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, I sleep better
because of that book--

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.198 align:middle line:84%
>> --because I don't watch
the 10 o'clock news anymore.

00:11:21.198 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that was one of these
little tips that I give people

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:10%
to improve lifestyle, to
avoid news at certain times,

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:10%
and all the time.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.702 align:middle line:84%
This is a basic program
of lifestyle adjustment.

00:11:31.702 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason
that these books

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:84%
are popular is that
they're commonsensical,

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:84%
they give people very
practical information,

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.030 align:middle line:84%
they're grounded in science,
and they really work.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
These are programs of
simple lifestyle changes

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.390 align:middle line:84%
you can make that really have
good consequences in terms

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.840 align:middle line:90%
of how you feel.

be putting these images

00:11:56.647 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And local television
news is the worst.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It's more and more filled
with violent images

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and violent stories
that are very

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.270 align:middle line:90%
upsetting to a lot of people.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people
to become uninformed,

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
but I want them to discover that
they have choice as to how much

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of this
material they let in.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I think people who--
there's probably one or two

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:84%
people in the entire audience
out there of millions,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:90%
they don't know who you are.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think they
should know that you're

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.580 align:middle line:84%
a very finely trained Harvard
University medical internist.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm also a professor of
medicine at the University

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:84%
of Arizona, and I am head of
a program we have out there

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:84%
called integrative medicine,
which is the first program

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:84%
at an American medical school
to try to train a new generation

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.090 align:middle line:84%
of doctors who are aware
of alternative therapies,

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
who really emphasize
the mind-body connection

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
really the future.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's great to see
American medicine beginning

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:90%
to open up in this direction.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>> But they have not been
too friendly toward you.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say, mostly, I was
ignored for a lot of years.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But now, an awful
lot of places come

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
to me wanting consultations
and wanting me to help them

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:90%
design programs of this sort.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:90%
So times have really changed.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you do?

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:84%
You've got a doctor
you like, but you

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:84%
say you want to start taking
some of these vitamins

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.265 align:middle line:84%
And he says to you, eat right,
you don't need any vitamins.

00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's important
to realize that doctors are not

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:84%
trained in nutrition
in this country.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Medical schools don't teach
nutrition of the sort that's

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:90%
in this book.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.435 align:middle line:84%
So if you've heard about
a vitamin or another kind

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.560 align:middle line:84%
of treatment and your doctor
doesn't know about it,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
you can help
educate your doctor.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.553 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've seen an awful lot
of patients in the past year,

00:13:36.553 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
especially, who've
gone on the internet,

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and have gotten information and
presented it to their doctors.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And that information
turned out to be very

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:90%
important to their well-being.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And so patients have become
now educators of doctors,

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.550 align:middle line:90%
in many instances.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:84%
To their credit,
many doctors realize

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot
of stuff out there

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.195 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't get
in medical school,

00:13:57.195 --> 00:13:59.725 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking for ways
to round out their education.

00:13:59.725 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And some of these doctors
are having problems with

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:84%
their health and are looking
for alternative methods.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> How popular is your new
school of medicine down there?

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's within the
University of Arizona College

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.220 align:middle line:84%
of Medicine, but we are
intensively training future

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:90%
academic leaders.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:84%
We're starting a
distance learning program

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.200 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be
based on the internet

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.460 align:middle line:90%
to train practitioners.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:84%
We are besieged with
requests for more trainings

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.170 align:middle line:90%
of this kind.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So as I say, I think
this is in the wind.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.402 align:middle line:84%
Our hope, eventually,
is to be able to change

00:14:32.402 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:84%
undergraduate medical
education, the first four

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.750 align:middle line:84%
years of medical school, so
that subjects like nutrition

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and mind-body medicine
and an overview

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:84%
of alternative
medical systems become

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:90%
part of the regular curriculum.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Now is the emphasis in your
program at this medical school

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:90%
on nutrition?

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The emphasis is
on good medicine,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.990 align:middle line:84%
but a big focus of this is
on lifestyle and lifestyle

00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:84%
analysis, because most of
the diseases that kill people

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and disable people prematurely
are diseases of lifestyle that

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:84%
could be avoided if
people, earlier in life,

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.480 align:middle line:84%
made better choices about
how to eat, how to exercise,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.530 align:middle line:84%
how to handle
stress and so forth.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So inquiring about
people's dietary habits

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and giving them suggestions
about how to improve nutrition

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.050 align:middle line:90%
is one big part of what we do.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:84%
We also use
nutritional medicine.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:84%
That is, if people come into
us with particular complaints,

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:84%
say arthritis, we can
help them design diets

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.707 align:middle line:90%
that will improve arthritis.

00:15:27.707 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
At the back of "Eating Well
for Optimum Health," there's

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:90%
an appendix that lists--

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
there's a long list of
common conditions there.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And under that, you'll
find specific dietary

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.322 align:middle line:84%
recommendations for
those conditions.

00:15:38.322 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think that's
very interesting,

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.027 align:middle line:90%
and people should--

00:15:41.027 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
if nothing else, they should
buy the book just for that.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for instance, if you've
got chronic sinus trouble,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.548 align:middle line:84%
it is very worth eliminating
all milk and milk products

00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:84%
for two months to see
what effect there is.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And the vast majority of
people will great improvement

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:90%
from that.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, a lot of doctors
probably would be very,

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:84%
very alarmed by one of
the things that you say

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:90%
in your book.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is, stay
away from doctors.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, clearly there are
times to go to doctors.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.825 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got any kind of
alarming symptom or unusual

00:16:10.825 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:84%
symptom-- you know,
you're getting chest pain

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.780 align:middle line:90%
on exertion--

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to go to a
chiropractor or a massage

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:90%
therapist or an herbalist.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.290 align:middle line:84%
You want to go right to a doctor
who can find out whether that

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:90%
represents heart trouble.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Or if you have
terrible stomach pain,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:90%
and your appendicitis--

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:90%
So those are obvious things.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
But there are an awful
lot of conditions

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.830 align:middle line:84%
out there today for which
conventional medicine is really

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:90%
not so good.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And it is worth knowing
about what else out there

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:90%
that you can do.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Also, I would love to
see more people become

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.240 align:middle line:84%
more self-reliant in
matters of health.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
rush off to HMOs and doctors

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.690 align:middle line:84%
without ever thinking what
they could do on their own

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.660 align:middle line:84%
to change some of their habits
that might cause improvement

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.935 align:middle line:90%
of their conditions.

00:16:50.935 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the
yearly checkup,

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:90%
or the six-month checkup?

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe in that?

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes and no.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
there are definitely

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.030 align:middle line:84%
some screening tests that
are very important undergo.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Mammograms for
women, pap smears,

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.510 align:middle line:84%
prostate screenings for men,
colon cancer screenings.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:90%
These are obviously important.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:84%
There is also this idea,
though, that if it's not broken,

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:84%
don't try to fix it, and
that looking for trouble

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.599 align:middle line:90%
sometimes leads to trouble.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I think it really
depends on who you are

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and what your lifestyle is
like and how good an observer

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:90%
you are of yourself.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
If you know your body well, if
you take good care of yourself,

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's less important to
have a kind of annual checkup.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
if you're relatively

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:84%
unconscious about your body, if
your life habits are not ideal,

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:84%
it's probably more
important to get checkups.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you think the
barometer would be how well you

00:17:44.025 --> 00:17:44.825 align:middle line:90%
feel?

00:17:44.825 --> 00:17:47.117 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's how well you
feel and how well you know

00:17:47.117 --> 00:17:48.190 align:middle line:90%
your body.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, that if you're really
aware of the range of changes

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:84%
it goes through, you know
when something is out

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.845 align:middle line:90%
of the ordinary for you.

00:17:55.845 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, some people are
just not trained at that,

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:90%
at listening to their bodies.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of people are afraid.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of
people are afraid.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go into another.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:90%
What about some of the--

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of people on here
who talk about energy healing.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Larry Dossey, who
talks about prayer.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What is happening down
in your clinic down there?

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, on our campus, there
is a human energy systems

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:84%
laboratory, headed
by Dr. Gary Schwartz.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:84%
He works with our
program, and they're

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:90%
doing studies of energy healers.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:84%
We have some research
projects set up

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
to look at energy
healing techniques.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
There is a very
well-known energy healer

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles named Rosalyn
Bruyere that we bring in

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.810 align:middle line:84%
periodically to work
with our physicians

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:84%
in training to teach them
what energy feels like

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and what it means to channel
energy into a person.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.175 align:middle line:84%
I think this is an interesting
field to keep an eye on.

00:18:47.175 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, at the
moment, we don't

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.720 align:middle line:84%
have scientific explanations
for what happens here--

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> But they have
scientific proof--

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>> We have ways of--

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> --that it works.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So this raises big
challenges to our conceptions

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.680 align:middle line:90%
of how things work.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.403 align:middle line:90%
I think, in the next--

00:19:04.403 --> 00:19:05.820 align:middle line:84%
in the coming
decades, we're going

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.653 align:middle line:84%
to have more and more
experimental work that

00:19:07.653 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
will document these effects,
and more importantly, we'll

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.460 align:middle line:84%
begin to come up with
mechanisms to explain what's

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:84%
happening here, because I
think that's the big mystery

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.090 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:84%
If a doctor can't
see a mechanism

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:84%
as to how something
could work, it's

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.480 align:middle line:84%
relegated to the area of
mystical and something

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:90%
we can't study.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.545 align:middle line:90%
I think this is all studiable.

00:19:25.545 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a wonderful quote
from one doctor that said,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:84%
even if it was true,
I wouldn't believe it.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.518 align:middle line:90%
>> I wouldn't believe it.

00:19:31.518 --> 00:19:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I wouldn't believe it.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>> But would you go
to an energy healer?

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I have done so.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You have.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'll just
tell you a story.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:10%
When Rosalyn Bruyere was here
at our program last time--

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.340 align:middle line:10%
this was in April--

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.872 align:middle line:10%
I was at the end of a lingering
upper respiratory infection.

00:19:48.872 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I had a sore throat that
I couldn't get rid of.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her
if she'd treat me.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.350 align:middle line:84%
She had me lie on a table on my
back, and put her hands here.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.190 align:middle line:84%
The moment she put her hands
on, what I felt was not subtle.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, her hands
felt like motors.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.930 align:middle line:84%
There were these very
intense vibrations.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.390 align:middle line:84%
If I put my hand on
hers, I didn't feel them.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Her muscles weren't shaking.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:90%
This was something else.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.790 align:middle line:84%
But very interesting
was, after a few minutes,

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I could feel these vibrations
going through my body

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.288 align:middle line:90%
down to my toes.

00:20:16.288 --> 00:20:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And even more interesting,
when she took her hands off,

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.570 align:middle line:90%
it continued for--

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I could feel it for about
10 minutes afterwards.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
She said that she had
amped up my chakras.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.598 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine
what most doctors

00:20:27.598 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:84%
would say if you
told them that you'd

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:90%
had your chakras amped up?

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, for whatever reason,
the next day, my sore throat

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:90%
was gone.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Was that coincidence?

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Was it related?

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it placebo?

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>> But I'd go back to her.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.120 align:middle line:90%
You know, it worked for me.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to know
what I was feeling.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.140 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.133 align:middle line:90%
I'm very curious.

00:20:45.133 --> 00:20:46.300 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what that is.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.425 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
it is scientifically,

00:20:47.425 --> 00:20:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be
able to study it,

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and I want to know
how to use it.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you believe it's
an energy that comes from

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.070 align:middle line:84%
the great unconscious,
God, whatever?

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, many of these--
this is stuff that goes

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:84%
on around the world in
many different cultures,

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and people have different
ways of conceiving it,

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:84%
but many people think or
teach that this is some kind

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
of universal energy that they
are able to allow to flow

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:84%
through them and
to direct outwards.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Physical contact with the
person is not necessary.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.572 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes this is
done from a distance.

00:21:17.572 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you said,
these studies that

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
have been done with prayer,
what's very interesting there

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.397 align:middle line:84%
is that the people
didn't even know they

00:21:23.397 --> 00:21:24.670 align:middle line:90%
were being prayed for.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't with
their knowledge,

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
which you could explain it then
in terms of a placebo effect,

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.928 align:middle line:90%
that it was belief.

00:21:30.928 --> 00:21:33.470 align:middle line:84%
But if the patients didn't know
this was being done for them,

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:84%
then there's got to be some
other explanation for it.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.543 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the important
thing that you say,

00:21:37.543 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:84%
the most important thing you
say is no one therapy is always

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:90%
indicated, that--

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>> --be open to
regular antibiotics--

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>> --to alternative healing.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And my aim, I'm not
trying to train doctors

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to master these
different systems,

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
but I do want them to
know that they exist,

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and what their strong
and weak points are.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you look at
inflammatory bowel disease--

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.260 align:middle line:84%
this is conditions like
ulcerative colitis,

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:90%
Crohn's disease--

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.250 align:middle line:84%
in my experience, the best
treatment out there for this

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:90%
is Chinese medicine.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole package
of acupuncture, herbs,

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.250 align:middle line:84%
dietary adjustment, massage,
sometimes energy healing,

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.060 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I think it works better
than conventional medicine

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle line:90%
for these conditions.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I would like doctors
to be aware of that.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got a patient
with ulcerative colitis,

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.890 align:middle line:84%
you can tell them that
this is an option,

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and you could help them
find a good practitioner

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.980 align:middle line:84%
of that system if
they want to try it.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And then also, to be there
with the conventional drugs

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.350 align:middle line:84%
if that doesn't work or
if there's a flare-up

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:90%
that needs suppression.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So that would, to me, be
the ideal kind of medicine.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you're the
ideal kind of doctor.

00:22:45.532 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:84%
I wish you were around
the corner and I could--

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I might go to a doctor
if I had one like you.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm busily training
others and sending them out.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've had a
wonderful, wonderful time

00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:00.180 align:middle line:84%
today with Dr. Andrew
Weil, talking about just

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.825 align:middle line:84%
general health, but in
particular his wonderful book,

00:23:03.825 --> 00:23:06.215 align:middle line:84%
"Eating Well for
Optimum Health."

00:23:06.215 --> 00:23:07.590 align:middle line:84%
As I always tell
you around here,

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:84%
we bring you the most
important new messengers

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.700 align:middle line:90%
