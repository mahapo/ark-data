00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:10%
>> This is "Book Tours"
and I'm Corinne Edwards.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.420 align:middle line:10%
I'd like you to meet one of the
most important new messengers

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle line:10%
in publishing today.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Important because the
authors on this show

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.350 align:middle line:84%
are dedicated to helping
your personal growth,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.890 align:middle line:84%
make you happier, healthier,
to be the best you can be.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
We are thrilled here
at Wisdom Television

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.520 align:middle line:84%
to welcome back Marianne
Williamson and her book

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:84%
"Enchanted Love the
Mystical Power of Intimate

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Relationships."

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It is seldom that
after I finish a book--

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and you can imagine that
I read a lot of books--

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that I go to my computer and
send an email to everyone

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I know to stop what they're
doing and read this book.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:90%
"Enchanted Love" is enchanting.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:90%
It is poetry, wisdom.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:90%
And it is practical.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:84%
It's always such a pleasure
to have you on board.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Corinne.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to talk about the most
practical chapter in the book--

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is Chapter 6.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And you call it Grown Up Love.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Grown Ups in Love, yeah.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it's wonderful to
talk about the theory of love,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.440 align:middle line:84%
but this chapter actually
gets down to beyond or before

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.080 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual to what mainly
makes people tick and what do

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.455 align:middle line:90%
they want.

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:10%
>> In that chapter, I quote
a woman whose lectures I used

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.550 align:middle line:10%
to hear a lot in Los Angeles
named Pat Allen, Dr. Pat Allen.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.290 align:middle line:84%
She's a psychotherapist
and an author.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of her work is based
on the theories of Carl Jung.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And she said a few
things that really

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:90%
affected me deeply in my life.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And one was that she claims
that a man's greatest psychic

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
need is to have his
thoughts respected.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And a woman's
greatest psychic need

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:84%
is to have her
feelings cherished.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think
sometimes women focus

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:84%
on what we think more
than focus on how we feel.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And also I think
sometimes we ask men

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
how they feel more
than what they think

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.620 align:middle line:84%
in ways that set all
of us up for behavior

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and experience that is less than
the most that we're capable of.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So I deal with that theory
of hers in that chapter.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.565 align:middle line:84%
>> You said that was
a revelation for you.

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a bit of
a revelation for me,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
because I'm very much
of the generation--

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I became what in
Carl Jung theories is

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:90%
called the father's daughter.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
What that means is this--
what Pat Allen suggests

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
is that when my generation
was around puberty,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:84%
our parents made
some big mistakes

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
in a psychological sense
with the best of intentions.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
just as young men

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
used to go-- and still in
some Indigenous cultures

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:90%
go through puberty rites.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Even today, the bar
mitzvah is basically

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:84%
a puberty right where there is
a ceremonial and ritualistic

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
transformation from
boyhood to manhood.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And basically, just
as in the bar mitzvah,

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
the real communication to
the community, to the boy,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
to his mother is that
he is a boy no longer.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:90%
He is now a man.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And the psychological
imperative there for the mother

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84%
is to stop coddling his
feelings and to start

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.030 align:middle line:84%
respecting his choices, showing
respect for his choices.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Now in our generation, a
lot of that went backwards.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And women thought that they
were doing the right thing

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:84%
helping men stay in touch with
their feminine by coddling

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
an adolescent boy and older,
coddling his feelings.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Cutting him too much slack?

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>> In a way, yes.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And fathers, often with
the best of intentions,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
made the opposite mistake
with their daughters.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So that we would come home
at adolescence, at puberty,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:90%
having made an A plus in--

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know--
something like science.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.273 align:middle line:84%
And so the father, once again
with the best of intentions,

00:03:57.273 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
slaps us on the
back and says, you

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.700 align:middle line:90%
can do as good as any boy can.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, we got some really
unfortunate messages there.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:84%
The girl, in that case, has
led to believe that achieving

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:84%
something, achieving more--
if I only achieve more--

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that will gain me love
from the men in my life.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And many of us learned,
very painfully,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:90%
that that's simply not true.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:10%
So what started to happen
was this really neurotic

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.490 align:middle line:10%
interaction between
grown men and women,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:10%
really stuck at adolescence,
with the message of the man

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:10%
tending to be my mother
still loved me when I acted

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:10%
like an idiot, why don't you?

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And the response is because
I'm not your mother.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>> You said--

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Excuse me, just a moment.

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And then the message to
the man from the woman

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
is my father loved me when I
achieved more and more, why

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:90%
doesn't that earn your love?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And the response is because
I'm not your father.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So we have to make a leap
across that great divide

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
to become women who respect
the man for his decisions

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and his choices and to love
a woman for her feelings

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and to put behind us that more
immature interaction where

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.992 align:middle line:84%
we got stuck, really, in the
dynamic with our parents.

00:05:07.992 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
letting me just complete

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:90%
the other side of that.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I think it's a very
important thought because I

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
also was brought up
along those lines.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:90%
You can do anything.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, which we can.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like we
want to go backwards.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're never suggesting
not to do everything.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely not.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's not what
gets the man's attention.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I'm suggesting
is that the psychological

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:90%
dynamic--

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:90%
you're a woman in the workplace.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm a woman in the workplace.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
psychological dynamic

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.640 align:middle line:84%
which is appropriate here
and which is valid here.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically
a masculine dynamic.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.993 align:middle line:84%
And I think all men and women
are masculine and feminine.

00:05:41.993 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm glad that you
and I have a chance

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to experience our masculine
dynamic, going out, doing,

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:90%
achieving.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Just as it's wonderful
for men to be

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
in touch with their
feelings and experience

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.380 align:middle line:84%
their feminine dynamic
that they can be passive

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:90%
and they can be receptive.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:84%
However, let's be really
clear when it comes--

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:84%
well, not only in
heterosexual relationships,

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.285 align:middle line:84%
because I think this
dynamic is the same even

00:06:01.285 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:84%
in gay relationships-- when
it comes to romantic love,

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:90%
it's a different dynamic.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So the same psychological
dynamic that makes you

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and me, in some cases,
successful in our careers,

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
if we want to be successful
in romantic relationships,

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:84%
we have to move into a
different part of the brain

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.123 align:middle line:84%
into a different
part of the soul.

00:06:18.123 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, and that
makes it sense.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:90%
There's yin and yang.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.848 align:middle line:84%
There's the active
and the passive.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:84%
There's the masculine
and the feminine.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:90%
And they're different.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's good.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Those are two
parts of ourselves.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So women have been attracting
these men who are still

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.570 align:middle line:84%
mama's boys, who seem to want
to express their feelings all

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're attracted
to us because we

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.020 align:middle line:84%
seem to be pretty
powerful and achievers.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes that's
one of the ways.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>> We get bored with them,
because we really want a man.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:06:46.945 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> We've forgotten our genetic
imprinting, haven't we?

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think there's
some genetic imprinting here.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And we need to be so
careful because we

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:84%
don't want to sound retro and
we don't want a sound backlash.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:90%
And we don't want to--

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> You can do anything
you want on this show.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I really do want to.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean I think it's important
not to be suggesting that we're

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:84%
supposed to go back 30 or
40 years because that's not

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.460 align:middle line:90%
what I'm saying.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply saying that there
is a way in which, I think,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:84%
men with the men's
movement, for instance,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.805 align:middle line:84%
now are realizing
that, yes, they

00:07:13.805 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:84%
got in touch with
their feminine,

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.530 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes at the
expense of their masculine.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.447 align:middle line:84%
And you and I got in
touch with our masculine,

00:07:19.447 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes at the
expense of our feminine.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a balancing
that's occurring right now.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Once again, we don't want
to give up the strides,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.240 align:middle line:84%
but we want to move into a
space of honoring the mystery,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have
demystified love

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:90%
in the name of mental health.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:90%
You know, love is a mystery.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's very fragile.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can't define
it all the time.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, Goethe once said
to analyze is to murder.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:84%
There is a way in which the
deepest experience of romance,

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:90%
it's a mystery.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that you
can just set up a formula

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:90%
and then you'll have it.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:84%
What you can do is
set up a temple.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:84%
What you can do is create
fertile ground, fertile ground

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.830 align:middle line:90%
for that mystery to unfold.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.093 align:middle line:84%
And then if it does, you can
honor it and you can tend it.

00:08:06.093 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't,
you can realize

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.318 align:middle line:84%
that even it's not being there,
it's part of a sacred journey

00:08:10.318 --> 00:08:12.610 align:middle line:84%
so that at least you're asking
the right questions that

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.542 align:middle line:90%
will lead you back to it.

00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that the masculine
mind is the externally focused

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:90%
mind in men and in women.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.410 align:middle line:84%
That has a part to
play, but it's only half

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:90%
of the creative existence.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the part of
the mind that can really

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:90%
earn us love or tend to love.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The part of the mind that
earns its love for a woman is

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:90%
a man who is a man.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.020 align:middle line:90%
And yet, we have been, somehow--

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.000 align:middle line:84%
been, somehow we've gotten
drafted, in many cases,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:90%
in becoming a man's mother.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't worked, because
it's really not what we want.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not what we want.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.203 align:middle line:84%
And at the deepest level,
it's not what they want.

00:08:51.203 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times women
will say, he left me

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:90%
after I did so much for him.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the problem was
that we did too much for him.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.870 align:middle line:84%
If you're to be a man's
lover or a man's wife,

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.400 align:middle line:90%
you're not his mother.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.197 align:middle line:90%
And you're not his teacher.

00:09:05.197 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That was another point.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you mother a
man or become his teacher,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
what that does is cancel out
his sexual attraction to you.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.443 align:middle line:84%
Because a man's
brain is not set up--

00:09:14.443 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
he's not supposed to go
into sexual attraction

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.160 align:middle line:90%
towards his mother.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.577 align:middle line:84%
There is a deep,
deep taboo there.

00:09:18.577 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Or his teacher.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, except in the
dysfunctional oedipal sense.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.903 align:middle line:84%
So this idea that we're
not doing it for a man.

00:09:26.903 --> 00:09:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes women
will say-- and what

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
we deal with in the book--
is that woman will say, well,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
if I don't, you
know, do it for him,

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.730 align:middle line:90%
he won't step up to the plate.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And the issue there
is if he doesn't

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
know how to step
up to the plate,

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.242 align:middle line:90%
then he's not the man for you.

00:09:39.242 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately the issue
is-- and then you say,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.955 align:middle line:90%
but I know he loves me.

00:09:42.955 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line in love
is not whether or not

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:84%
they love you but whether
or not they choose you.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Say that one more time,
because I think that's one

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.208 align:middle line:84%
of the most important things
you say in that chapter.

00:09:51.208 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:10%
>> The bottom line in love is
not whether someone loves you--

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.230 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we've all
been in love affairs

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:10%
where somebody loved us but
it's still ended tragically

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:10%
or we loved them and it
still ended tragically.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.370 align:middle line:84%
The issue, the
bottom line issue,

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
is not whether someone loves
you but whether they choose you.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Real love, the deepest romantic
love, is an adult decision.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's an adult
choice that we make

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:84%
to show up for this experience
even when I'm not in the mood,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:84%
to focus on your innocence,
even when your guilt seems

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:84%
so obvious to me, to
focus on who you can be

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:90%
rather than who you've been.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a very adult, adult
game, a very adult dance.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been dancing here
today, really dancing,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:84%
with Marianne Williamson about
her book "Enchanted Love:

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
The Mystical Power of
Intimate Relationships."

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.636 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:10:41.636 --> 00:10:45.052 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:45.052 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.450 align:middle line:10%
We've been talking to
Marianne Williamson

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:10%
today about her beautiful
new book, "Enchanted Love:

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:10%
The Mystical Power of
Intimate Relationships."

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're into
practical things--

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.580 align:middle line:90%
what men are really like.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:90%
What does a man want today?

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I'm not a man so
I can't really answer that

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:10%
question perhaps, but I do
know this, that I know--

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:10%
and of course here we're talking
about the heterosexual dynamic,

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.310 align:middle line:10%
although as I said
before, the same is

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:10%
true in gay
relationships, I believe--

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.210 align:middle line:10%
I think in a
heterosexual dynamic,

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:10%
I think that it's
important for us

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:10%
to realize that a man shows
up as a man most fully

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:10%
in the presence of a woman who's
really showing up as a woman.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.412 align:middle line:84%
And I think a woman
shows up as a woman

00:11:31.412 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:84%
most in the presence
of a man who's

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.200 align:middle line:90%
really showing up as a man.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So that means that on the
deepest level what we really

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.891 align:middle line:84%
want from each other is
for you to be yourself,

00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:41.995 align:middle line:90%
for you to be yourself.

00:11:41.995 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that goes
back to this business

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.078 align:middle line:84%
don't think about
what you're doing

00:11:45.078 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:84%
for him in the sense of his side
of the net in the relationship.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:84%
How can you be the woman that
is yourself, the most glorious?

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And how can a man be
the man that he can be?

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Once again, that's why
I'm a fan of things

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:90%
like the men's movement.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I think something really
good is in the air that way.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think the rest of
life takes care of itself.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:84%
If you take care of who you
are and how you want to show up

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:84%
in the world, not
with a sense of need,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.720 align:middle line:84%
or a sense of somebody else, or
something else completing you,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:84%
but in the fullness
of who you are,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and that fullness cannot
be achieved with--

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I believe-- without
spirit, without God.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
When that kind of love--
whether we call it God or not--

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
when a power higher than we are
becomes the overriding purpose,

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and mission, and identity that
we relate to in our lives,

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:90%
we become full.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And then other people
and other situations

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:84%
will be automatically
attracted to you.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to think
about what does a man want.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Think about what you want to be.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And by definition, that
will be what some man wants.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Do you tell a man what you want?

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.944 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, if he asks.

00:12:52.944 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing you
say is when he tells you

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:90%
what he wants, believe him.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's a really big
one for women, isn't it?

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Yes, men-- I quote in
there a friend of mine who

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:84%
said, "Most men want love
as a vacation and women

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.255 align:middle line:90%
want it as a lifestyle."

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's
true of all men,

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:84%
but I do think that
women often overestimate

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:84%
kind of what a man's commitment
is in a relationship,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.920 align:middle line:84%
because we never
really asked him.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And usually they
don't lie unless we've

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:84%
proven with our behavior that
we get hysterical if they do.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>> And do women lie?

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that women do
lie, but I would say that--

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, I won't comment.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, listen
there are millions

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.137 align:middle line:90%
of women, billions of women.

00:13:33.137 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But I think in general, in
terms of male psychology,

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:84%
there is a level on which
women tend to ignore

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:90%
what a man actually told us.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Because he often will say
I'm just looking for fun here

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and we think that the
relationship is so intense

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and the sex is so amazing that
he didn't really mean that

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:90%
or I can change his mind.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.785 align:middle line:90%
And that leads to a lot of pain.

00:13:55.785 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:84%
It's best, number one, to
believe a man when he tells you

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:84%
he's not in it for any
more than just some fun.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.933 align:middle line:84%
And number two, to ask him
before you allow your heart

00:14:03.933 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
to get involved and, certainly,
before you allow your body

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.208 align:middle line:90%
to get involved.

00:14:07.208 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Because once your
body gets involved,

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.208 align:middle line:84%
your heart's going
to get involved.

00:14:10.208 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:90%
That's a genetic fact.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:84%
There are literally chemicals
emitted by the brain

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:84%
as soon as there's a
sexual interaction.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And so for us to
over casualize has

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.620 align:middle line:84%
been a tragedy in many cases,
physically, emotionally.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're giving too
much too soon sexually?

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I think.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean that like,
duh, these days.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean people get that now.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:84%
To jump in just to those
deep waters before we've

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
really established what's
the magic factor here

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.455 align:middle line:90%
and what's the commitment here.

00:14:39.455 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, are we really in this
for something deep, and sacred,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and important or is this
just a weekend of fun?

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Because a woman who really
values herself deeply,

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:54.433 align:middle line:84%
if that's all it is, we save up
for a much more important, much

00:14:54.433 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:90%
more important relationship.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.433 align:middle line:90%
>> What about a man?

00:14:56.433 --> 00:14:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Listen, I think
these days it's men,

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:84%
every bit as often as women,
who say I'm not going to do this

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:84%
because I'm past that kind of
superficial level of sexual

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.270 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, it's the
same for men as women.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.467 align:middle line:84%
>> You said in the book that
one of the biggest pains in love

00:15:15.467 --> 00:15:17.800 align:middle line:84%
relationships is you've given
your heart to somebody who

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:84%
never wanted it in
the first place.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And would have told you
that if you bothered to ask.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>> And would have told you.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And maybe he told you and
you just didn't believe it.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But these are the lessons
you live long enough,

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:90%
you learn them.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.078 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things that's

00:15:31.078 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:84%
so exciting about being
at a certain age where

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:84%
it's, like, you've been
through enough of that.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:84%
You get to a point
in your life where

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.700 align:middle line:84%
you've heard so many
people's romantic stories

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.408 align:middle line:84%
and you can relate to
them because you've

00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:42.370 align:middle line:90%
played every character.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:90%
You've been the one who left.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:84%
You've been the
one who got left.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:84%
You've been the one
who was an idiot.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
You've been the one
who wasn't the idiot.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:48.932 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:15:48.932 --> 00:15:49.750 align:middle line:90%
You've done it all.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.958 align:middle line:90%
And then you're really ready.

00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:84%
You're at a level of your
life has chastened you.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, at that point,

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.010 align:middle line:84%
we often are
carrying these scars.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think that love
can be, in the best

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:84%
sense of the word,
a kind of hospital

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:84%
for each other's broken
spirits and broken souls.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's, to me, the meaning
of Isis lifting or Osiris

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle line:90%
from the dead.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the meaning to
me of Mary Magdalene

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:84%
asking for Jesus's dead
body and being the first one

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.690 align:middle line:90%
to see him on the road.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Not his mother, not
his male disciples,

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.660 align:middle line:84%
it was Mary Magdalene who saw
the resurrected body first

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:84%
because she was
in love with him.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that someone who deeply
loves you has the capacity

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to repair you, not in a neurotic
sense of enabling and doing it

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
for you, but in the sense that
if I see the perfect in you

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.780 align:middle line:84%
that becomes a vision
that then impels

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.975 align:middle line:90%
you to rise to that level.

00:16:39.975 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the greatest gift
we can give to each other.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:84%
That is to see the
best in each other.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.240 align:middle line:90%
I see the beauty in you.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I can't make you beautiful, but
I can see the beauty in you.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I can't make you brilliant, but
I can see the brilliant in you.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.490 align:middle line:84%
It goes much deeper than
trying to convince you of it.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And if I see it, then my
behavior will reflect that.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And then my whole
presence in your life

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.480 align:middle line:84%
becomes a space in which you're
more likely to grow into it.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, we give
rebirth to each other.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And then that makes romance
a kind of psychic womb

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.599 align:middle line:84%
for the emergence of ourselves
at the next highest place.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge cosmic
phenomenon here.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.009 align:middle line:90%
This is a planetary repair.

00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:19.960 align:middle line:84%
This is a fundamental
quantum leap

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.910 align:middle line:90%
forward for men and for women.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's who we
need to give birth

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.347 align:middle line:84%
to now, not just new babies,
but new beings within ourselves.

00:17:27.347 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going
to save the world.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what nature needs
from us, not necessarily more

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:90%
babies, but more wisdom.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I liked the way you treated
the person who feels as though

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.392 align:middle line:84%
they've been wronged in a
relationship in your book.

00:17:42.392 --> 00:17:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Give me an example,
because I don't know exactly--

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You were talking about a
woman who has been abandoned

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:84%
by a man or a man who has been
abandoned by a woman and how

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.648 align:middle line:84%
to view that in the
larger, metaphysical sense.

00:17:53.648 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You know at the lectures
that I've been doing around

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.570 align:middle line:84%
the country on this book,
I've been ending the lectures,

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:04.700 align:middle line:84%
often, with the men standing
up and apologizing prayerfully

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
to the women and the women
standing up and apologizing

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.110 align:middle line:90%
prayerfully to the men.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we have a truce?

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we have amnesty
between the sexes?

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we just
cancel the debt?

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's been hurt.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Men have hurt women.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.785 align:middle line:90%
Women have hurt men.

00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:90%
We've been abandoned.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.493 align:middle line:90%
And we've abandoned.

00:18:21.493 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's just do this huge
group, "I'm really sorry.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.790 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mean to hurt you."

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way we can
go on, because otherwise I

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:90%
have abandonment issues.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm expecting you to cater
to my abandonment issues

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:84%
even though you're not
the one who abandoned me.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:84%
My father was the
one who abandoned me.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:90%
And we're stuck in this.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we just start over?

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that I
don't want to be stuck forever

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:90%
in this "my abandonment issue."

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And I can realize
that if you left,

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:84%
you weren't necessarily
abandoning me,

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.750 align:middle line:84%
you were just
turning the corner.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't an against me.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:84%
It was a for something that
you felt was your next step.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:90%
So I have a choice here.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I can either see this
as an abandonment

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:84%
or see it in its higher context
which is you met another choice

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:90%
and I can respect you for that.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And if it was the right
choice for you, then it was,

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, I will see
the right choice for me.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And if it wasn't the right
choice for you or for me,

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:84%
God's still bigger
than your choices.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to
lose out ultimately,

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.340 align:middle line:84%
because if there's a
level of love here we

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.150 align:middle line:84%
could have exchanged and
you chose not to experience

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:84%
with me, somebody else
will because that's where

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:90%
my consciousness is right now.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:90%
So I have a choice.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to stay in this
rather neurotic and low level

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:90%
abandonment issue stuff forever.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I can move on to a more glorious
sense of myself and of love.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've
come to believe.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> One of your famous quotes--

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and you used it before
in your last book.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.430 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And it is "If the train
doesn't stop at your station,

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.685 align:middle line:90%
it's not your train."

00:19:51.685 --> 00:19:52.485 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:19:52.485 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I used that again in
this book, as I had,

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I think, in "Return to
Love" because so many women

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and men, I think,
relate to that.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I've said
to women, particularly,

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
but it's true for men,
if the train doesn't

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:84%
stop at your station, it's
because it's not your train.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.120 align:middle line:84%
We hold on to
relationships that aren't

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:90%
blooming, aren't working.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's because
the conductor of that train

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.810 align:middle line:90%
is right.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:84%
His intuition or her intuition
is saying don't stop here.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
But our intensity is
delaying-- don't go!

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:90%
Don't go!

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Don't go!

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Don't go!

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.198 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
tragedy there is

00:20:25.198 --> 00:20:27.757 align:middle line:84%
there is another train trying
to get into your station,

00:20:27.757 --> 00:20:29.340 align:middle line:84%
would get into your
station, but can't

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.048 align:middle line:84%
get into your station
because of this one

00:20:31.048 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't even belong
there anymore is delayed.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It's still in your station.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So this idea of detaching,
it's a hard area to detach

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a very difficult
area to say,

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.350 align:middle line:84%
"Dear God, it's in
your hands, whatever."

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:84%
But if we can, it's like
any other area of life.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.582 align:middle line:84%
If you can give it over
to the flow of something

00:20:51.582 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:84%
with a greater
wisdom and a greater

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:84%
kind of cosmic intelligence
than your ego thinking,

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:90%
we can have it all.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>> But I've heard men say,
"I know she's going to come

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:84%
around, because I'm just
waiting for her to grow up."

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.182 align:middle line:90%
Should we wait?

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I think every
case is different.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.043 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell a person
what they're supposed to do.

00:21:10.043 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle line:10%
You can't judge those
things from the outside.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.820 align:middle line:10%
I think God tells
us those things.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes the lesson in a
relationship is hang in there.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the lesson
in a relationship

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.060 align:middle line:90%
is learn to let go.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.742 align:middle line:90%
Every relationship is different.

00:21:21.742 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so
important to meditate.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so
important to pray

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.190 align:middle line:84%
so that we can get clear about
what a higher wisdom is really

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.720 align:middle line:90%
saying to us.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>> If you could sum up
your whole book, Marianne,

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:84%
in about a minute, and there's
somebody out there who needs

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:84%
some help right now,
what would you say?

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:90%
What is this book about?

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that there
is an inner room,

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.450 align:middle line:90%
kind of like a romantic chakra.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a temple.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:90%
It's like a romantic temple.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think it dwells in all
of us, at least in potential.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's like any
other temple space inside.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
If we knock on it, then
the door will open.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:90%
And we can go in there.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And if we go in there
and allow the love that

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:84%
is in there enter
into us and renew us,

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:84%
then sooner than
we have any idea,

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.117 align:middle line:90%
someone will join us in there.

00:22:12.117 --> 00:22:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think if you
really want somebody,

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:14.750 align:middle line:90%
you can have them?

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, not necessarily the
person you think you want?

00:22:17.042 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Not person, but a person.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that if love, if
intimate love and partnership,

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
with a beloved is the
highest growth for our souls,

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:84%
then it's reaching out for
us and the real issue becomes

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:90%
how receptive we are.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And can we tell that by
how strong our longing is?

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.188 align:middle line:84%
I think that our longing
for another person

00:22:40.188 --> 00:22:41.730 align:middle line:84%
as "The Course of
Miracles" says it's

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.190 align:middle line:90%
a shadow of our longing for God.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I think it's part of
our journey to God.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a great mystery.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:84%
But I think that if we embark on
a deeper conversation with God

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.730 align:middle line:84%
about it, not just, "Dear
God, send me somebody,"

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:84%
but "Dear God, show
me what it means

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:84%
to be on a sacred
romantic adventure,"

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:84%
then I think the answers
come more than we know.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you are a
marvelous answer.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>> We've been privileged today--

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> --to be talking to Marianne
Williamson about her book

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.590 align:middle line:84%
