00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>> When I decided to come to
England and Scotland for this

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:84%
trip, I just thought it
would be a trip for people,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:84%
not a part of a mission until I
understood the system of what I

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
was doing around Europe, which
was this healing process related

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:90%
to the concept of the apple.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:10%
All the mythological stories
that I've been following,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:10%
they describe, actually, the
magnetic field of the planet.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:84%
They describe a stone
that is surrounded

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.900 align:middle line:84%
by water that has a sword,
which is the axis, a tree, which

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:84%
has rainbows all around,
which is the magnetic field,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and the golden apples
are the nodes of the net.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And there is always a knight
that has to take the sword,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.930 align:middle line:84%
heal the wound,
fight the dragon,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and make the poison, which
is the wounds of this Earth,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.240 align:middle line:84%
into medicine, which is the
transcendence and potentials

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that you can activate
from yourself.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's a description of
how the DNA is activated

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:84%
by the power of realization and
taking the power back within

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and not searching
for it outside.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:84%
All those keys are
telling me that we

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:84%
have to find the rotten apples
in our own tree of life,

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:84%
try to heal the wound
there, grab the sword,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and take the power back from
the light, from the water,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and release the poison, which is
the potential, the power that we

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to use
without consciousness.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's why to have
a purpose in the north

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:84%
means to bring consciousness
related to the poison

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:90%
and create medicine.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So every time that we
travel through the planet

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and we create an
initiative path,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.580 align:middle line:84%
we are actually following
the trace of the branches

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:90%
and the roots of that tree.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.090 align:middle line:10%
I decided to call the trip
Hol-hah because in Atlantean

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:10%
language, "hol" means
a cycle of time,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:10%
and "hah" means to eternity.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:10%
So Hol-hah means a
cycle of eternity,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:10%
which is related to the days
out of time in the Atlantean

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.480 align:middle line:10%
calendar, the 30/31 of
July and 1/2/3 of August--

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.170 align:middle line:10%
those days usually are
called the days out of time

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:10%
when you complete a
cycle of 360 days.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:10%
The year begins when the star of
Sirius appears in the horizon.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:10%
In the north
hemisphere, that occurs

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:10%
in the first week of August.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
We organized this trip
during the days out of time.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the Hol-hah is to
make all the people, not only

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:84%
the ones traveling
but also those

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.080 align:middle line:84%
who are connected to
our trips in the network

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:84%
to do something special
every end of the cycle

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of a new one.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to
celebrate, like,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:84%
a kind of a weird
Christmas in which we all

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
remember, oh, these days
are the days out of time.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So we should do
something special

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and connect something
all together

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and put an intention
as a network.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of the
path is to start

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:84%
walking to create this
engagement for everyone to know,

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, these next
days, we will start

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
putting an intention
with all together

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:90%
to say happy year to everyone.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Our path through Great
Britain is through the chakras

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:90%
of the island.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:90%
So we follow this line.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And Avebury represents
the second chakra,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
which is the womb, the center
of creation, the sacrum.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
The circle of Avebury represents
a cell that is divided in two.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's the circle
representing the pilgrimage

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:84%
of all the feminine energies,
all the mothers that

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:84%
went there to connect with
Mother Earth, Mother Sky,

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.980 align:middle line:90%
the origin of life.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.960 align:middle line:10%
I decided to start in
Avebury because of the trees

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:10%
that take care of the
information of that circle.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.880 align:middle line:84%
There are four trees that are
a sacred spot-- the guardians.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They are the keepers
of the memory.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So every time that I
want to ask something

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:84%
or to understand what I'm
doing, I usually go there first.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
talking to the trees

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
there is like talking
to the energy of all

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
the motherhood that has
been created in that land.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So my idea always is to bring
the people under the trees,

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:84%
to feel that they are part
of that family, in that cell,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:90%
in that womb of Mother Earth.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.340 align:middle line:84%
This place here--
for me, these trees

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:84%
are very important because
they, for centuries,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.880 align:middle line:84%
have been taking
care of the energy

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and the memory of
this territory.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it's important
that we begin our trip here

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
because in these roots,
connecting with these ancestors,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
we can connect with
the information of all

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:84%
the circle that represents the
womb or the mother cell of all

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:90%
the island.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:10%
Usually, when people
say I go to Avalon,

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:10%
we relate Avalon
with Glastonbury.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:10%
But actually, when
we say Avalon--

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:10%
for the ancient ones
was the entire island,

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:10%
was all the British Isles.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:90%
So what is the task?

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:84%
To start collecting the
apples of the tree of life.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to collect the
apples of the tree, which

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:84%
are our chakras, put them
on the basket of our "I am,"

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and take it to the
north, to the crown.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:84%
We are not leaving Avalon
when we go away to the north.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.020 align:middle line:84%
We are going through Avalon
until the very last stone

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.150 align:middle line:84%
circle, the Ring
of Brodgar, which

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
is in the Orkney
Islands, that represents

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.820 align:middle line:84%
the crown, the
connection to the spirit.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So the stone circles will
represent the negative going

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:90%
inside to the center.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And the natural ones
will be representing

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:90%
the outside, the expansion.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
But everything is
related to the apple.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And all those apples
come from the same tree.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
The night before the people
came, I went to the circle

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:90%
to receive the information--

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:90%
also to ask permission.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
That place there, for
me, is the place where

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.640 align:middle line:90%
I talk with the Merlin.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And when I say Merlin
is the name of a bird,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
the Merlin is a
black bird and is

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
the name of a brotherhood
of druids that

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:90%
call themselves the Merlins.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:90%
It was not only one person.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So I usually go, and whoever
is there to talk to me,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:90%
I talk to him.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And then when I travel
through stone circles

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:84%
or some other places,
different Merlins appear.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's not only one.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:90%
It's like an order.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
My talk was about what
should I do with the people.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:84%
I never think before exactly
what should I do in the trip.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And he told me something
that I have to be--

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:84%
in which I have to be very
clear with myself, which is you

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:90%
are not here for the people.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:90%
You are here for the land.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And people are cells
that hold the memory

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that you need in order
to access what it's

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:90%
needed to be worked for many.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:84%
You have never been
working for people.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.110 align:middle line:84%
You have always been
connecting cells.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So he was very tough,
saying that to me,

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.750 align:middle line:84%
because I was concerned--
like, what should I

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.680 align:middle line:90%
do with people for the people?

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:90%
And he said that.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So that gives me much certainty
and clarity and trust--

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.090 align:middle line:84%
the process of the
information of every circle.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So the message was to take them
through nine circles and nine

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:84%
natural places, going
through their nine chakras.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So this code, 999,
told me that is

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
the code that will hold
the pattern in the center

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and will open every
wound of the system

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
in order to heal the
system to take the poison

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and take it and turn
it into medicine.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:84%
That day, I explained
to everybody

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:84%
what the circle means, this
feminine power, and what

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:90%
is the tree of life.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So we could understand that
the task during this Hol-hah

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:31.630 align:middle line:84%
would be to assimilate that
information of the tree,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:84%
find the wounds in each
one of the circles,

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and start to build
up the tree again.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So, in order to do
it, I gave to each one

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
of the people in a
ceremony an apple

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.165 align:middle line:84%
that they have to take care
of during the whole trip.

00:10:48.165 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
We breathe in and
start to resound

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
by following the frequency
and relate it to our soul.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So every apple is like a heart
or a toroid, a magnetic field

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.460 align:middle line:90%
by its own.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And the main purpose
is for them to have

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:84%
something physical
outside to relate to,

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
like I have my
heart in my hands,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and I have to prevent for it
to get rotten for 14 days.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.980 align:middle line:84%
That day, when I
was explaining that,

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.440 align:middle line:84%
a crop circle appeared
outside Avebury.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't go because
we knew that the day

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:90%
after, when we left.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:10%
The crop circle is
actually nine circles,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:10%
nine circles, nine circles, all
connected in a net into one.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:10%
It's the same
explanation that I did.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:10%
Glastonbury is the center of
spirituality in the region.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:10%
And the Abbey of
Glastonbury is the place

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:14.140 align:middle line:10%
where the story says José de
Arimatea took the Holy Grail

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:10%
to England away from Israel.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:84%
The story is actually
about a place

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:26.440 align:middle line:84%
where the feminine is respected
because the Holy Grail actually

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:84%
refers to a woman that
has within the lineage

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine
and God on Earth.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So the abbey was holy
because all the women used

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to gather there because of
the ponds and the wells that

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:84%
were coming from the
Tor, from the hills.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So all this water
were a place where

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:55.180 align:middle line:84%
they connected with the force
of the mother of nature.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And actually, all those wells
created a pond of water, a lake,

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:84%
where they call it
the Lady of the Lake

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:90%
through the sword of Calibur.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, Merlin
would take it from the lake

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and put it on the sword,
so King Arthur or whoever

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:84%
has a pure soul could go and
take the sword from the stone.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So that land there represents
the Isle of Avalon,

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:84%
the place of the apples,
where the lake was

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.075 align:middle line:84%
created by the wells and
the sword was hidden.

00:13:34.075 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
When I got there, I knew
that there's the legend,

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and also, there is a
physical inscription

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
that the tomb of King Arthur
was supposed to be there.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So I invited everyone to honor
the territory and the holy place

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:90%
that it is.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt called to walk
around, and I felt the call--

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:84%
go to the pond, go to the
lake where the sword is.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea there was a pond.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:90%
I had never been there.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I'd always been in the abbey
by itself, and that's it.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So I started to walk around,
and I said, where is the pond?

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Where is the lake?

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling was
where Avalon is.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:90%
That's where the apples are.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So I started to look
for an apple tree.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking
into every apple.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Where is the apple?

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Where is the apple?

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Where's the apple?

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't find any until I
suddenly saw the pond surrounded

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:90%
by a forest of apple trees.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea that existed.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.930 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK, this is it.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.920 align:middle line:84%
This is the pond
that maybe represents

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.585 align:middle line:84%
the very ancient pond that
someday was around the area.

00:15:04.585 --> 00:15:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:84%
As I first entered
the forest, I tried

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:84%
to feel which tree
was calling me.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So I saw one that felt like
extending its hand towards me.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So I went to extend my hand
to say, like, here I am.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And when I did that, instead
of grabbing the leaves,

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:90%
I grabbed a dead branch.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.390 align:middle line:90%
So as I got it, I pull it out.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And this little wand
up here it was broken.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:90%
So it was like, I took it.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
that was a gift.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And a little apple fell
from there, from the branch.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So I got it too,
put it in my heart.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
didn't have a wand,

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:08.380 align:middle line:84%
so it was a gift
from the apple tree.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.930 align:middle line:84%
As I call everybody
to come to the pond,

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I locate them, saying, OK, maybe
we have to do, I don't know,

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.830 align:middle line:90%
meditation here.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can see it
facing the lake.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.770 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was there.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was waiting,
like, now what?

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:90%
What should I do?

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So I was called by
another tree, so that's

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.890 align:middle line:90%
why I went to the tree.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I got there, I started
to feel the presence of someone

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:90%
emerging.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.674 align:middle line:90%
He came to me and took over.

00:17:04.674 --> 00:17:20.079 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I went back to the
pond and started

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:32.625 align:middle line:84%
to make them all breathe
to realize where they were.

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:35.710 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that I
remember from what he said--

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:84%
he said remember
that your spines

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.345 align:middle line:90%
are held by the trees of life.

00:17:47.345 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Look within.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Find the real power,
the tree of life.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And everyone was
giving their back

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:84%
to the forest of apple trees, so
everyone was feeling the trunks

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:90%
in our spines.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So become yourself-- the
apple tree, the tree of life--

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.715 align:middle line:84%
and feel the chakras
being the apples.

00:18:20.715 --> 00:18:23.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And after that, he connected
every crown chakra,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:90%
aligning the spine of everyone.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:84%
He started to say, now
that you recognize yourself

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:48.560 align:middle line:84%
as the forest, look in front of
you, and you will see the Tor.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And right in front, it
was the Hill of Tor.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, remember that "Tor" is
another name for the mother that

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:90%
has united you all here today.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:90%
"Tor" means tower.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:90%
And tower in Hebrew is "migdal."

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So Mary of Magdala
is the mother of love

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:84%
because Mary means
"love" in Egyptian.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's the love of the one
that lives in the tower.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:34.400 align:middle line:90%
So the Tor is a feminine aspect.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:84%
The tor is basically the
mother of the humanity,

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:90%
the mother of god.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's the feminine aspect
that you have to align with.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So open your legs and
connect your wombs,

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.830 align:middle line:84%
even if you are
a masculine body.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Connect with that.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Connect with the
tower as a symbolism

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
of power of the feminine
rising up to the skies.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And when he was calling that
he said, look into the sky,

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and you will see
the father, God.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And the son was right
there above the tower.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so she
is the feminine.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:90%
He is the masculine.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And the way you will
see the masculine in you

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.880 align:middle line:84%
is by the reflection
of the water.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So see the light
coming to the water,

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and you will see the lake
becoming the eye of god.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:84%
The reflection of
the soul within you,

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:84%
where the invisible
meets the visible, where

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.370 align:middle line:90%
the spirit is born in the body.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:56.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Water are the eyes of god.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
When you see yourself in
the reflection of the water,

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.270 align:middle line:84%
you are actually seeing
yourself being god.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And that reflection is the
two sides of the sword.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So the sword is actually
your own reflection.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Grab your reflection
from the light

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and make the sword come
up, from your reflection

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:84%
up, cutting in half
all the apples so you

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:34.640 align:middle line:84%
can see inside the seeds with
a poison and, from there,

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.300 align:middle line:84%
create medicine by
sowing a new tree.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So it was like this whole story
of going up and rising the power

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:49.040 align:middle line:84%
through god, entering
through the womb,

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:90%
through the apple tree.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So all the symbolism was right
there on how to take that.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So it was like,
that's how Merlin

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.680 align:middle line:84%
got to take the
sword from the lake,

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:90%
by seeing god in the water.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.220 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:15.230 align:middle line:84%
When it ended, when he finished,
he went to the only dead tree

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:84%
because every tree that
is alive is magnetic,

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and the trees that
are dead but still

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:90%
standing, they are electric.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.940 align:middle line:90%
So they're masculine.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
It means that all the feminine
that are alive in those trees

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.040 align:middle line:84%
are creating life and
in magnetic field.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And the dead is the one
that goes up to the sky

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:90%
or deep into the ground.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So he went there straight,
and he grabbed a spider web

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.900 align:middle line:84%
with my hand and took
all the Spider web

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:90%
and put it around the apple.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, remember,
you are the weaver.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.925 align:middle line:84%
And so weave the net
of the apple tree.

00:23:04.925 --> 00:23:09.775 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.775 --> 00:23:10.575 align:middle line:90%
And he left.

00:23:10.575 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:84%
After the abbey, we went
to Chalice Well, which

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:90%
is where the famous pond is.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And that well has healing
powers since very ancient times.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was for them to
connect with that healing,

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
connect with that moment
of meditation and silence,

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.245 align:middle line:84%
to assimilate what we have
been receiving in the abbey.

00:23:45.245 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we cross to
a very holy, sacred place,

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
which is a pagan temple
called White Springs.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a pagan temple where
you connect with the feminine

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.250 align:middle line:90%
and the masculine.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:84%
As we finish with that
purification of the body,

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.190 align:middle line:84%
with this unification
of the two sides,

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.365 align:middle line:90%
we went up the hill to the Tor.

00:24:24.365 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:90%


00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.560 align:middle line:84%
I was walking slowly
because I wanted to be sure

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.800 align:middle line:90%
that everyone was arriving.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.570 align:middle line:90%
So I was the last one.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I got there,
the whole group

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.580 align:middle line:90%
already started activation.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:49.470 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, it was very,
very important at that moment

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:84%
because it was like,
nobody's waiting for me,

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:90%
and they know what to do.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:90%


00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was like
when a teacher sees

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
that the students
already know how

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:84%
to solve a problem without
he had to say anything,

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:90%
it was like, oh, cool.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
That was a very,
very nice feeling

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:20.700 align:middle line:84%
of seeing how they managed
to feel the resonance,

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:84%
to start sharing, to create it
with anybody saying what to do,

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and taking benefit
of the environment,

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.960 align:middle line:84%
of what was happening
in the environment.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
powerful energy

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.220 align:middle line:84%
that started to go up
and up with all the power

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:42.910 align:middle line:84%
that we just talked about of
the sword, and take the sword,

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and then go up there
in the hill to the Tor

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and bring all the power
of the wombs going up.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So all the women were
creating this circle,

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:58.580 align:middle line:84%
dancing and chanting, and it
was so powerful, so beautiful.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just had to say two
or three words for them

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.100 align:middle line:84%
to remember some
things, but that's it.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And everything was, like, very
powerful, going up and up.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:90%


00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I was grabbing the
light of the sun that

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:21.310 align:middle line:84%
was coming from behind to
bring the light of the divine

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.140 align:middle line:90%
into the womb.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And in the same moment I
did that, in the center, one

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:32.830 align:middle line:84%
of the ladies of the group,
she raised up the crystal ball.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:38.080 align:middle line:84%
But she raised it up like this
to put the light exactly there.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
But she was on her
back, so she couldn't

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:90%
see that I was doing that.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.930 align:middle line:90%
So it was all perfectly aligned.

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And as we were
doing it, I brought

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:53.650 align:middle line:84%
the energy, and a seed of
those who are flying around,

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:58.870 align:middle line:84%
the white, big seeds, enters
and follows the pattern

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and goes to the center and
starts to rise up in a circle,

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.895 align:middle line:84%
and it goes up and up as we
were doing faster and faster.

00:27:06.895 --> 00:27:10.820 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, everyone,
at the same time,

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:84%
started to find silence,
and the seed went up.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So it was like the confirmation
of that activation.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:36.350 align:middle line:90%


00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:84%
When the power of the feminine
rising up towards the sky

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.390 align:middle line:84%
manifested in a seed
that went to the skies,

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:51.590 align:middle line:84%
I understood that Stonehenge,
which is the root chakra,

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:90%
should receive that seed.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.470 align:middle line:84%
That's why, in the
next day, we prepare

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to give the seed
to the core of Stonehenge.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:08.920 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.040 align:middle line:10%
Stonehenge was the
main ceremonial center

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.010 align:middle line:10%
for all England and Scotland.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:21.190 align:middle line:10%
The Merlin said every seed is
covered in a kind of a poison.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Turn the poison
into medicine.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to use our poison in
order to create something new.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:90%
