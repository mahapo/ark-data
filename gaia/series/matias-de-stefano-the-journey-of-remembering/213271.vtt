>> As we move on to Scotland,
we enter the eye of Loch Ness.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.810 align:middle line:84%
People were asking if we came
to Loch Ness to see the monster.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I was saying,
there's no monster here.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:10%
But we can interpretate that
that monster is inside of us.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:10%
That monster is actually
our perception of reality

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:10%
and how the ego is trying to
control what it sees outside.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So from a spiritual
point of view,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:84%
the monster is us trying
to control the outer world.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.225 align:middle line:84%
From the physical point
of view, that monster only

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:90%
existed because of whiskey.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Loch Ness, it's a deep fault
that separates the low highlands

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:90%
from the north highlands.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:21.070 align:middle line:84%
That lake is like an
eye that sees beyond.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:84%
As we went to the lake,
I wanted for people

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
the eye means.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
For that, we've been talking
about the realization of how

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:84%
everything is a projection
from our vision,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:90%
from our inner sight.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:10%
As we were there in one of the
main and more historical places,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:10%
we closed the idea to
go back to the eye,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:10%
go back to the inner vision.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
As Inverness and all that
region represents the entrance

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness
in the body,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Loch Ness represents
the pineal gland,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
which is the inner
vision, the consciousness.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland is the
gland that usually produces

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.340 align:middle line:84%
these chemical reactions
that make us sleep or make

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:90%
us wake up.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in the
spiritual, energetical aspect

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
represents to wake up towards
consciousness, awareness,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.820 align:middle line:84%
or to sleep, to live
your life being asleep.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I reflect constantly
what is outside.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean that
I am creating the outside.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I am just creating my
image of the outside

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:90%
from my own perspective.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why we create our
own realities according

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:84%
to how we tune our
vision of the world

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
by understanding that everything
that we'd see outside, inside,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:90%
we see the opposite.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So by going into
meditation, we can

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:84%
switch the image of what
we have in front in order

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:84%
to change the perception
that we have outside.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:84%
We went to our next step,
which was Clava Cairns,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and Clava Cairns is the
entrance of consciousness.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the entrance of
all the possibilities

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:90%
that exist in the universe.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Clava Cairns is a structure that
was used for burial activities.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
They would create these circles
to put fire in the center

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and call the spirits to
rise up to other dimensions.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
It is right aside
a very dark place

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:84%
related to Scotland history,
which is Culloden Hill.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Culloden was the
battlefield when

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
the British and
the Scottish fought

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:84%
for independence
and to keep Scotland

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:90%
free from the English kingdom.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
people dying there.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But this sacred place,
it was not designed just

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:90%
as a burial place.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
It was designed as a
bridge between dimensions.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.770 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell that
because the structures that

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:84%
have been created
there, they are exactly

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
aligned as the pyramids of Giza,
as the constellation of Orion.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.220 align:middle line:84%
The constellation of
Orion is a portal.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
that's a portal

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:84%
is because from our point
of view in this planet,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
the stars are aligned with the
auric number or the Fibonacci

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:90%
spiral.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.940 align:middle line:10%
So that means that the stars
from this point of view

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:10%
are pointing us, where is
the center or the origin

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:10%
of our energy in the skies.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Which means that it's a
portal to transcendence

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:90%
to another dimension.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Every structure that has been
built in our planet related

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
to the Orion
constellation is not just

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
to guide us through the sky
but also through dimensions.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
That's why this place
is like a portal

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
for all the different
visions of reality

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.510 align:middle line:84%
towards this matter or this
reality, or from this reality,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:84%
transcending to
another dimensions.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
I relate this with
the eye of God,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:90%
with the center of all things.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
The idea in that stone
circle was to access that.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that, we
had to switch the idea on how

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
we activate things,
because for this one,

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:90%
we had to meditate things.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So it was not about singing
songs or activating energies.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It was about meditating
towards the center

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and finding the tuning,
like a radio station.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And as I become aware of every
part, I take a deep breath.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Release.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:84%
The sounds of activation
means vowels and consonants.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:84%
But the sounds of
getting into the eye

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:84%
means high-pitch or
low-pitch frequencies.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's more like
[IMITATING MACHINE SOUNDS],,

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.378 align:middle line:90%
like a machine sound.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So we started to
connect with that

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and created a whole spiral
movement towards the center

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.120 align:middle line:84%
so we could see the
eye of God, which

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.380 align:middle line:84%
is the entire
consciousness, projected

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:90%
in all the subconscious.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:24.465 align:middle line:84%
So every eye in the existence
is only one eye in that reality.

00:07:24.465 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:84%
When we connected
with that spot,

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.530 align:middle line:84%
for me, it was very
powerful because I felt,

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:84%
again, the frequency of
the eighth dimension.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's the weaver, the toroid,
all the eyes spinning around

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:90%
and connecting to the center.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So the image of this weird
spider that doesn't have a body

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
started to weave all the
frequencies together,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:90%
creating only one eye.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:05.170 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:84%
People started to feel that they
were going farther and farther

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:84%
to the center of something
that they couldn't relate to.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So some of them had
problems going back

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:84%
because it was too
expansive, and they

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.490 align:middle line:90%
had no idea where they were.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:90%
But that was the point.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:84%
The circles were created with
these tuning frequencies.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
They create a frequency

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.990 align:middle line:90%
into other dimension.

connecting to the dimension

which is the eighth dimension.

Yo soy el ojo.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:90%
I am the eye.

Where all the eyes are together
and my higher self name, Ghan,

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:90%
means that, means eye.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But the feeling of
connecting with those eyes

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:23.040 align:middle line:84%
is like a lot of rays of light
going out and coming back

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:84%
from the dark pupil to the
iris, all the colors around

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and then coming
back to the center,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.790 align:middle line:90%
reflecting photons everywhere.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
That feeling of trying
to feel that sensation,

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:43.560 align:middle line:84%
it creates the image of those
Indian gods with many arms

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:90%
around or a spider.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So the feeling is that
there is no up and down.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:90%
There is no gravity.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.147 align:middle line:84%
So everything just moves
into any dimension.

00:09:57.147 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:84%
You are feeling the
frequency of everything,

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:90%
like a spider feeling the net.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter
where you are.

You are feeling
everything, and you don't

have a point of reference.

When I came back, I was trying
to find a point of reference,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.460 align:middle line:84%
like a tree or a
rock or something,

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:90%
to say I need to ground.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:90%

that saying, I cannot come back.

every dimension.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Some of them said, I felt that I
was everywhere at the same time.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Others said, I felt
I went to a planet,

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:90%
and someone was talking to me.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:84%
They felt many weird things
that they are not used to

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
because the
frequency we tune in,

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:84%
it was not from the usual
expansion and connection.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:84%
It was about going
to a place where

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:90%
there is no point of reference.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very crazy place
where you stop being yourself,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and that is very moving
when you come back.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So that same day that we
activated that in Clava Cairns,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:84%
all the eyes together, a
new crop circle appeared,

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:84%
which was an eye
surrounded by triangles.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:84%
When I went for the
first time to Avebury,

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I felt this connection
with the crop circles

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
that has been appearing
for thousands of years.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:84%
What they told me was
that the stone circles

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.590 align:middle line:84%
had been created in
that region because they

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:90%
saw the circles on the fields.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
following where

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:84%
to build the circles
according to the guidance

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
of the beings that were
showing that information.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So they understood that
some of the circles

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
would be like portals that would
help to activate information.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it was like this
is the information that we

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:90%
want for you to receive.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And we, in the
physical, put the stones

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:84%
to absorb that information,
to grab that information.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:84%
As we had the point of entrance
and expansion of the eye of God

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:84%
in Clava Cairns, activate
the pineal gland in Loch Ness

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:84%
to observe the possibilities of
us being the creators of what

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:50.860 align:middle line:84%
we see, we go outside to the
outer third eye in the forehead,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:90%
which is the Island of Lewis.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And the stone circle
there is the one

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.430 align:middle line:84%
that connects with the
projection outside the body.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I was explaining in
Garry beach how the stone

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.420 align:middle line:84%
circles are created by nature at
first, and then we imitate them.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why we went first
to a natural place that

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
is forming a stone circle, where
the natural stone circle is

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
being created, and the portal
is being created by nature.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So we could learn about this
electricity and magnetism

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.550 align:middle line:84%
of that technology that takes
you to another dimension.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
only one stone, it's

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
electrical energy because
it connects up and down

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:90%
electrically.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a stone circle,
all the electrical pulses

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:90%
create a magnetic pulse.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So we can say that every stone
is like the masculine energy,

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
which is electrical,
going up and down,

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:90%
connecting to another realities.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
have a stone circle,

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.280 align:middle line:84%
you have all of those electrical
pulses going to the center.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It creates a spinning vortex,
so that's a magnetical,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:90%
and that's the feminine.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:84%
It means that the
masculine sends data

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:84%
from one side to another, and
the feminine takes that data

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and creates something, manifests
something in the center.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So we have been in the entrance
of the energy of the third eye,

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.190 align:middle line:84%
the center of the
third eye, and now we

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:84%
are at the projection
of the third eye.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:10%
For us, in this world
and this reality,

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.760 align:middle line:10%
projection means future.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:84%
But for the reality
in the universe,

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:56.895 align:middle line:84%
projection means to throw
away something that is inside.

00:14:56.895 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Our next step was Callanish.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.620 align:middle line:84%
The stone circle
there is the one

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
that connects with the
projection outside the body.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's like three
circles, three eyes

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
that we have in order to
connect to the fourth direction.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Callanish is a very
beautiful stone circle

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.360 align:middle line:84%
that has an entrance
from the north

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and a way out towards the
south and an alignment

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:84%
that receives the light of
the sun to a specific cairn

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:44.050 align:middle line:84%
inside, where the
priest or priestess

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.690 align:middle line:84%
used to receive the
information of the sun.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And then it's the releasing of
the information into the west.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So the whole system of
Callanish is like an airport,

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:90%
like an entrance port.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So that explanation
helps us to understand

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:84%
that the four
directions of Callanish

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
opening the gates to every
direction of time and space,

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:84%
with the stone circle
creating a magnetic field.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:84%
We have one stone, the
tallest one in the center,

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:90%
making the electricity.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So that place was supposed
to be used as a way

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:84%
to create a space machine
that could take you

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:84%
to every dimension
and go straight

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.655 align:middle line:84%
to one specific place, which
in this case is Sirius.

00:16:37.655 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:84%
The first time
that I went there,

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:90%
I went with a group of people.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't alone.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
what to expect.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:84%
My idea was to go there and make
a ceremony during the night,

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:84%
receive information,
and that's it.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And as I connected there,
I just left the body.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, I
appeared in a hospital

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
in Sirius, a wide place, a
bed with the shape of an egg,

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.640 align:middle line:90%
and someone laying down.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that it was me,
the one that was laying down.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And he had a heart attack,
and I felt the heart attack

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:90%
and how he was dying.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:31.730 align:middle line:84%
As I was feeling that there,
I was feeling that here.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I felt I was having a heart
attack here in this reality.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So I fell down on the floor, and
people were trying to help me.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't come back.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:84%
They had to rub me, and so
it was very hard for me.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said to his assistant
to show me something.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So he took me to
another building.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And I remember walking through
a hall with crystals aside,

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and I could see the
capital, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.690 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing, the view.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.650 align:middle line:90%
We crossed to the other side.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And as I got there, he
went into a circular hall.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:84%
He got in the middle,
and he started

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:84%
to show me little
models of every stone

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.870 align:middle line:84%
circle, every pyramid
and holy place on Earth.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge place with
all these little models.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Like an architect
working, he was just

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:84%
touching them like if they
were buttons on a machine.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.475 align:middle line:84%
So as he was spinning,
it was a tuning.

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:84%
[IMITATING MACHINE SOUNDS],,
like this.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
communicate or send information

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:90%
through them.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It was like a machine for
every stone circle, every rock,

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:90%
and every place on Earth.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And he went to the stone circle
of Callanish, and he said,

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:84%
this is where you can
communicate with you here.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is the place,
and he was tuning that.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:90%
And he said, now come back.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Everything will be OK.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:90%
I will be in charge of you.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And I came back, and
I left the place.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So I never came back
until two days ago.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.340 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So I was worried
about what to feel.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:84%
What would be the connection
in that moment, in that place?

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Because it was terrible
for me last time.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And so as we got there,
there were some people.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And naturally, without
me saying anything,

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
everyone started
to make a circle.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Even the people that were
not part of our group,

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
they were part of the circle.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
whole Callanish circle

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:59.340 align:middle line:84%
was full of people in
a circle doing sounds,

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.855 align:middle line:90%
and they started to connect.

00:20:00.855 --> 00:20:06.850 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:84%
The idea of going there was
to use the magnetic field

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:18.260 align:middle line:84%
related to the
subconscious and connected

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.310 align:middle line:84%
to the antenna of the electrical
stone, which is the conscious.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was to put all
the subconscious together,

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
which is very
irregular, very chaotic.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.730 align:middle line:10%
All this fuel that is burning
all the time through emotions

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:10%
and to put them all together,
aligned to that rock

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:10%
and rise it up for a few seconds
towards the consciousness.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.839 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:45.839 --> 00:20:47.750 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.870 align:middle line:84%
In the center, Giga and
I were tuning the sound,

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:90%
which is the sound here.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.280 align:middle line:90%
So I went to the stone.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:90%
I touched the stone.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, a
mosquito comes to my ear

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and starts to make the
pitch that I needed to find.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And then a bee comes
from the other side,

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and it was like
[IMITATING MACHINE SOUNDS]..

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So when I started to do that,
everyone started to do the same,

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.249 align:middle line:84%
and we all started
to pitch into that.

00:21:17.249 --> 00:21:20.672 align:middle line:90%

00:21:20.672 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
When I got it, I started to
go to each one of the sites

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:84%
to connect with all the
different chakras and wounds

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:84%
in the subconscious of
everyone and connect them

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
all into one string from the
heart towards the center.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:84%
It was like a spider web,
so from different chakras

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
connecting to only
one and make it sound.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.654 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:49.654 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:84%
The idea was to use
all the subconscious

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:90%
energy towards the center.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.470 align:middle line:84%
That's why it was so
irregular at the first moment.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:84%
It was chaotic sounds because
that was the idea, for them

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.860 align:middle line:84%
to call each one of
the dissonant energies

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:17.210 align:middle line:84%
to be the fuel for
one resonant energy.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And as we connect them
all to the center,

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I started to create
the snake energy

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.770 align:middle line:84%
towards the tree of life, so
all the rotten apples nourishing

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:31.570 align:middle line:90%
the tree.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:90%
So the snake could go up and up.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And once it touched the highest
point of the rock, we all tuned.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
[IMITATING MACHINE SOUNDS]..

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:47.890 align:middle line:84%
When everyone tuned,
it was the connection

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.190 align:middle line:84%
of the high consciousness
for a moment.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
I went up, up, up.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:23:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I felt I entered
that place of all the stone

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:90%
circles in Sirius.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I felt that,
I felt the expansion

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.250 align:middle line:90%
of being there with my own self.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And they cut the communication
so I don't get lost there.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And they cut it saying,
like, that's it.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.650 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.290 align:middle line:84%
What you have come
here to do is perfect.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:84%
But I saw all 36 codes that were
around in the circle saying,

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.460 align:middle line:84%
this is the new download
you will receive because you

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:90%
are closing a cycle.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow is my 36th birthday,
which means that it closed

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:50.560 align:middle line:84%
a cycle of consonants, which are
the codes that I have been doing

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
every day of my life to wrap
a circle, my own stone circle.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So he showed me all
these codes that I would

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.700 align:middle line:90%
receive the day of my birthday.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So I was so happy,
and I felt that I

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.805 align:middle line:84%
was called by angels or
whatever when I was coming down.

00:24:10.805 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I
was falling down.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:90%
It felt very soft and beautiful.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.550 align:middle line:84%
But I hit the ground,
and I started to smile

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:90%
because I felt fine.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But then the whole
body started to hurt.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And that was the end
of the communication.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:43.240 align:middle line:84%
As we did that activation
there in Callanish,

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:48.010 align:middle line:84%
which is the four directions
and the three circles getting

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:52.010 align:middle line:84%
together, a new crop circle
appeared that same day,

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:57.070 align:middle line:84%
which was related to the three
circles and the middle one

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:03.870 align:middle line:84%
with four philosopher's stones
as a compass to every direction.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have been
guided from the underground,

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.340 align:middle line:90%
from other dimensions.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And the confirmations
of what we are doing

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.205 align:middle line:84%
is being shown through
the portal of England.

00:25:17.205 --> 00:25:20.610 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:26.610 align:middle line:10%
The initiatic path means to
search for the cold places

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:10%
to activate energy.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:10%
The ceremony at the
Ring of Brodgar, for me,

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.520 align:middle line:10%
is like the end of
a path that I've

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.880 align:middle line:10%
been led to for a long time.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle line:10%
I actually felt I
understood the messages

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.590 align:middle line:10%
Merlin, through many
years, was telling me.

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:50.310 align:middle line:84%
He said, I am guiding
you for you to become me.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:53.660 align:middle line:90%
