00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>> All these islands,
Great Britain, is Avalon,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:90%
the land of apples.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.040 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the whole
trip was to open

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:84%
the wounds related to the
tree of life, to the apples.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:84%
In the very beginning
of the path in Avebury,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.700 align:middle line:84%
in Glastonbury, we took the
apples, gave them to the people

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and said, "These
are your hearts.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Take care of them until the
very last moment of the path."

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So whatever happens
in every stone circle,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:84%
feel the apple
becoming your heart.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.980 align:middle line:10%
What I've been experiencing in
this trip, like in any trip,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.170 align:middle line:10%
was this movement of so
much pain and dramas,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:10%
and conflicts that we
have all in our story.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:90%
And that comes up sometimes.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:90%
That was what it was meant to.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we feel that if
we are in a conscious path,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:84%
if we are doing a
work for the planet

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.360 align:middle line:84%
or for the light,
or the universe,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:84%
we should all be very beautiful
light beings and workers that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:84%
love each other and are
beautiful, and whatever.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:90%
And no.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that Merlin said was,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:84%
"You cannot shine if you
don't go to the darkness.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:84%
The darkness is the one
that allows you to shine.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you don't
see your brightness."

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think that people went
through all this process

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:84%
of going deep into the darkness
to see their own faults,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:84%
to see their own conflicts,
and to understand

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.240 align:middle line:84%
that their own inner
process were helping

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle line:84%
the process of everyone and that
their own personal conflicts are

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
actually helping
the entire planet,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
like a tiny cell is
helping our entire body.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
All this time that I've
been walking and following

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:84%
stories and bringing people to
all this path for me was like,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
we are looking for something
and I have to show something.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:84%
But actually was this
process of realization

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
of how all the huge stories of
mythology, they come together.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday at the
bridge in Yesnaby,

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I was telling the
people, create the bridge

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that connects the Earth with
the Heaven, a bridge that

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
is within us and that we have to
build from our physical reality

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:90%
to our mind.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
time that I thought,

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I have to check
what Brodgar means.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Brodgar is a Viking name
that I had no idea about.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to wear
during the whole trip

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:90%
the symbols of the Vikings.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And Brodgar means the bridge
in the land or in the field.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Brodgar is the place under
the ground, the physical,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.120 align:middle line:84%
towards Asgard,
which is the Heaven,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:90%
the bridge towards the divine.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Merlin was saying, build
a bridge between Brodgar

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.540 align:middle line:90%
and Asgard.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
are bringing you here

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
that rainbow bridge.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And the rainbow bridge, it is
all the colors of the chakras

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:84%
together, creating
only one color, which

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
is this golden white
platinum color that

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:90%
connects all the others.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And he was showing
me how the difference

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.020 align:middle line:84%
between each one of us, how
the process of each one of us

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:84%
as individuals are creating
a ray of color or a stone

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:90%
where the information is there.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
get all together,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:84%
all the rainbow appears or
all the stone circle appears.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And by being who we
are supposed to be,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
becoming one with the rest,
we create the white light

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:84%
of enlightenment,
which is the crown.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:90%
We create the rainbow.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:84%
We create the whole bridge
between Heaven and Earth.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%
That was my moment of
realization of everything

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
doing, like creating

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
these bridges, these doors, and
how all these conflicts, all

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
these projections, all this
initiatic path that everyone is

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
living within are the ones
that build up the rocks to be

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:90%
part of the stone circle.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't do
that initiation,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:84%
if we don't do that path for
our own self, our own story,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
with our own dramas and traumas,
we cannot build our own spot

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:90%
in that circle.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, for me, it was
very fulfilling to understand

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:84%
all the different traditions
and mythologies that

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
have been leading me to Brodgar
constantly since the very

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
first time that I came here
that my guides told me,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.340 align:middle line:84%
you are part of the circle,
but you moved to the wall,

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:90%
to the center.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the
center is a circle.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:90%
The circle is a center.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
There is no one
without the other.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And that gave me the strength
to keep going, to saying,

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.280 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter if I
have to be in the center

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and be in the
center of attention,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.410 align:middle line:84%
or it doesn't matter if I have
to be on the side leaving others

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:90%
in the center.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I will be always doing
something in the center,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:90%
coming back to who I am.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:90%
[GENTLE MUSIC]

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:84%
The stone circle of
Brodgar, now it's

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
been very protected because
the soil is falling apart

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and the plants
that are there have

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to be very careful because
they are holding the ground.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to go
inside the circle anymore.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
But when I go there, usually
before I get into the circle,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I visit the hills that are
around, which usually were also

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:90%
places for stones.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when we see a huge
circle or a huge pyramid,

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.940 align:middle line:84%
we tend to be attracted to
it, like if there's the power.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes to
access that power,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:90%
you shouldn't go straight.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like all the calculations
that the spaceship needs

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.740 align:middle line:84%
to do in order to get
out of the planet.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
You should know specifically
where the energy is going,

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:84%
where the spinning
is going so you

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.710 align:middle line:84%
don't go straight up or straight
to the source because otherwise

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:90%
you can get burned.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So instead of going straight
to the main power source,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:84%
you go to the ones that are
leading you softly to the energy

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
to prepare yourself to
get into tune with that.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why I went to the
circles to ask permission

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.400 align:middle line:90%
to say, where are we going?

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.130 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing?

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And the one that called
me was completely full

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:90%
with yellow flowers.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So I said, maybe this
is the right spot

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:07.110 align:middle line:84%
to prepare people consciously to
understand why they were there

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.090 align:middle line:90%
and why so early.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I call them all to
be there at 4:00 AM,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:84%
which is very cold in Orkney
islands, even if it's summer.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:90%
So it was freezing.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:28.260 align:middle line:84%
The idea of that was
because sunrise was at 5:05.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And before the sun rises,
it's still the day before.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:84%
It's still-- the day is
out of time in our calendar

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:90%
where we are working with.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is the last hour
of our days out of time.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And in 45 minutes,
it's a sunrise,

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
so it's the beginning of the
year in Atlantean calendar.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:84%
All the path that we have
walked is an inner goal

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:90%
to sow something external.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:84%
This circle reminds
us that for something

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to be manifested in the
center, a circle must exist.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:84%
When every heart finds
the center of itself,

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:90%
the circle is formed.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
The white light
can only exist when

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:90%
all the colors get together.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
You may think, why
a process like this

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.970 align:middle line:84%
must be done in a
place that is cold,

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:50.540 align:middle line:84%
difficult. The Druid said
that the real light of oneself

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:56.330 align:middle line:84%
can only shine in the
adversities of the space

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:84%
when the environment
is a challenge,

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:08.980 align:middle line:84%
when the time, the water,
the wind is uncomfortable.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
The first sentence Merlin
said to me in my life was,

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.640 align:middle line:90%
"Cold doesn't exist."

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was in
a mountain in 2012

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and I've never
felt Merlin before.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea about that.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I was in Spain, so no
relation to anything.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
It was freezing cold, winter,
February, snow in the mountain,

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and I felt someone that
came and said, "Sit down."

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was snow so
I had to sit wet.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly his first words
that I have ever felt from him

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:90%
was, "Cold doesn't exist."

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And he started to say that the
reason why we feel the cold

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:84%
is because we are not
properly activated.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So we have to activate ourselves
and activate the dragon

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.900 align:middle line:84%
within us, which is
the divine spark.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So the heartbeat is the one that
activates the energy for you

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.220 align:middle line:90%
not to feel the cold.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Cold is absence of energy, so
you have to feel the energy.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So he started to
talk about that,

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.735 align:middle line:90%
and he reminded me that today.

00:11:16.735 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:84%
The first sentence I ever
heard from Merlin was,

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.830 align:middle line:90%
"The cold doesn't exist."

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:32.545 align:middle line:84%
That's why the universe
pulses a bit to create energy.

00:11:32.545 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:41.120 align:middle line:84%
That's why he said,
the initiatic path

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.480 align:middle line:84%
means to search for the cold
places to activate the wit.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say today to
you, cold doesn't exist.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:90%
There is only beat.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Search for the heartbeat.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Locate yourself in the
center of your own circle.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.075 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel the
beat, come to the center.

00:12:10.075 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.520 align:middle line:84%
The ceremony at the
Ring of Brodgar,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:84%
for me, it's like
the end of a path

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
that I've been led
to for a long time.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.470 align:middle line:84%
I haven't felt that I was
supposed to channel there

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:90%
or to guide or lead anybody.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I actually felt I
understood the messages

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:84%
that Merlin, through many
years, was telling me.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.930 align:middle line:84%
All the mythology,
all the traditions,

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:84%
all together related to one
only story, which is basically

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
to go to the eyes of the cosmos
and to go back to the center

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.890 align:middle line:84%
by using the energy
of the kundalini,

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.860 align:middle line:84%
by using the crown
of the king of kings,

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:11.500 align:middle line:84%
by putting together the tree,
the toroid, the atoms creating

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.940 align:middle line:84%
energy, being the
eyes and the dragon.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a whole story
in something very simple.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And all the initiatic
path and all the stories

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.340 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
leave everything,

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:90%
it was just about that.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:84%
He was telling that to me and I
was explaining that to people.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:38.336 align:middle line:84%
It was not something
that I knew before.

00:13:38.336 --> 00:13:41.717 align:middle line:90%
[GENTLE MUSIC]

00:13:41.717 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:50.850 align:middle line:84%
With deep breaths, we
begin to hit the inside,

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.265 align:middle line:90%
burning the inner fire.

00:13:52.265 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Merlin said, "From the cold, the
path of the dragon is created.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:23.620 align:middle line:84%
From the movements, from
the breath," he said,

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:84%
"the Trinity of
the fire and night,

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
creating the centers of energy,
the chakras that enlighten

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.960 align:middle line:90%
the path of creation."

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:84%
The movement of the
energy is the one

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that ignites the spark
that creates the dragon.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:15:02.380 align:middle line:84%
The sparks are the sparks
that become the eye of God who

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.006 align:middle line:90%
observes Dracon.

00:15:04.006 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Move the body with your breath.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The spark of every chakra
to ignite from the cold.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Ignite the dragon.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Ignite the colors of your being.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Activate your heart.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Feel the ice ignite all the
chakras of those around us

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.956 align:middle line:90%
to burn.

00:15:30.956 --> 00:15:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I ignite the fire from
the feet to the knees.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.335 align:middle line:84%
With every breath,
I ignite the dragon.

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:90%
I was not channeling Merlin.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I was becoming what
he always told me.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
In that time, I felt he was like
saying to me, now you can do it.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Now you can go and
do that alchemy.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:10%
And that made me feel complete
because the first time that I

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:10%
came to Britain
that he told me, go,

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:10%
and he made me do this
whole path alone, he said,

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:10%
"I am guiding you for
you to become me."

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:10%
And it's not that the
Merlin of the storytellings.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.440 align:middle line:84%
As I said, there
are many Merlins.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So he called himself
the alchemist, this one.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "I am pushing
you for you to become me."

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:90%
And in that moment, I felt that.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I felt very dizzy at one moment
that I felt I was falling down.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And I just let myself
die for a moment.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, his energy
came back and raised me up

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and I felt his presence in
me, not as a channeling,

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:90%
but as a part of me.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Hold the crown upon your heads.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Hold the fruits in your hearts.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, we took the
fruits in the South of Avalon,

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
we deliver these
fruits to sow the seeds

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:90%
in the North of consciousness.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:18:04.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the alchemy of all the
stories together within us.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.885 align:middle line:84%
This is the bridge
between Heaven and Earth.

00:18:08.885 --> 00:18:12.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Brodgar meet Asgard.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.340 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:84%
That's why he called
us there to that hill

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.270 align:middle line:84%
to prepare us to understand
why we are the bridges so we

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.775 align:middle line:90%
could go to the actual bridge.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I recognize my own path
as the stone in a circle.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:84%
When all the stones with their
personal path get together,

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
they create the tree
of life, the circle.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you
have lived by your own,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
when you get in a
circle, it becomes

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:90%
part of the tree of life.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the circle.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Happy new year.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Today was a very powerful,
fulfilling moment

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.595 align:middle line:84%
when I saw everyone
going around.

00:19:22.595 --> 00:19:30.910 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.850 align:middle line:84%
I started to move around
the circle in order

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:38.860 align:middle line:84%
to introduce myself to
each one of the stones,

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
to say that I'm ready to
accomplish this next step

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and weave in my energy
into each one of the stones

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.120 align:middle line:84%
so I could be connected
with this place

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.170 align:middle line:84%
everywhere all the time,
feeling the connection

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:84%
of the crown of this
place with my own crown.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And the task was to
take care of the apple,

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.980 align:middle line:84%
to sow our information
of this tree of life

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
that we've been opening all
these rainbow colors inside

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:84%
of us through every chakra
so we could sow it here

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:90%
as the trees of life in Brodgar.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
last task was to feel

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
the connection between
Brodgar and Asgard

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and deliver the apple as a
seed for the tree of life,

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:90%
using the poison as a medicine.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:84%
It was amazing to see
that it was all cloudy.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.690 align:middle line:84%
There was no way for us to
see the sun rise, anything.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It was 5:00 AM in the
morning, freezing cold.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And as I was completing
the circle, when I saw up,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.380 align:middle line:84%
there was a circle
that was clear around,

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:90%
exactly above Brodgar.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And everything was
cloudy, but a circle

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:84%
that was blue above
and an eye appeared

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.280 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, a very beautiful
eye like the one in the crop

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:90%
circle in the middle.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And I just connected to
that and I remembered

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:90%
I am the one that sees.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one that sees the
whole, the things, the universe.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And that connection for me was
amazing because the first time

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.840 align:middle line:84%
that I ever remembered
the universe,

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%
it was because I was laying down
in my bed with 15, 16 years old

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and I saw an eye
coming from the roof.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And this eye touched my own
eyes and I saw the whole thing.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
started to remember

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.840 align:middle line:84%
the universe and the answers of
the dimensions and everything.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So seeing that eye
on the sky there,

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.560 align:middle line:84%
it was like, I'm
home again, like I'm

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:90%
starting again to see beyond.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:24.690 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Today, which is my birthday,
my 36th turn around the sun,

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I felt that all that path that
I've been weaving was completed

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:84%
in that moment when I translated
the message of Merlin to myself

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.580 align:middle line:90%
and to others.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was like
understanding the whole history

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
walking through, why

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I had to remember
a Viking life, why

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I had to remember an
Egyptian life, why

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.040 align:middle line:84%
this life and this life,
and this information,

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:90%
that information.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:09.480 align:middle line:84%
It was like connecting all
the dots to come to Brodgar

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and to build the bridge
to Asgard and Heaven

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:20.980 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, which was the path
that I've been taking in Egypt,

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Ater Tumti, bringing Heaven on
Earth, and Brodgar to Asgard,

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.550 align:middle line:90%
and it was the same.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was like the
two lives, the Viking life

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptian
life both speaking--

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:84%
talking to me about this moment
of understanding this stone

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
circle that we people are and
this bridge that we have within,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and the sword that
is in the center,

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and the Philosopher's
stone, which is the ego,

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and the crown, which is
all the colors together,

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.550 align:middle line:90%
all the chakras together as one.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So all this realization
was fulfilling.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And he told me, this is--

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:90%
36 is the end of a cycle.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And there is a tradition
in the Atlantean culture

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that I remember that there are
nine vowels and 36 consonants.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.300 align:middle line:84%
The vowels are the creators
and the consonants structure

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:90%
the creation to give it shape.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So the 36 consonants
are actually

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.550 align:middle line:84%
the ones that tell
you where to go

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and what to do
with that creation.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So once you completed
the 36, it means

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that you have come
from the divine

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:90%
to the seed in the creation.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
You have sown the
seed in the very depth

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:51.570 align:middle line:84%
from the doors of the spirit
going through the 36 steps

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:55.110 align:middle line:90%
to be able to put the seat down.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And from there, going
up again 36 to Heaven,

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
like descension and
ascension path that

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:84%
gives the 72 steps that
are the notes of the planet

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:90%
to give the whole term.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I felt that today I accomplished
the first 36 coming down,

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:26.150 align:middle line:84%
from the spiritual
mind where I belonged

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:31.680 align:middle line:84%
till being anchored in
this reality and saying,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:38.730 align:middle line:84%
"I am here a human, grounded,
living a physical reality,

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and I came from the spiritual
world, but now I am here

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and I have to be
strong in this reality

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and sow the seeds
in this reality.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that from
this moment on, my task

00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:84%
will be to see how the seed
starts to grow and search

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:05.090 align:middle line:84%
for the light again to go
back to the spiritual realm.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:90%
