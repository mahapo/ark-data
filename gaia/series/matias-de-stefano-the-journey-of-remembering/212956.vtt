00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a sentence that
keeps repeating in my head,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.030 align:middle line:90%
you are here to remember.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Several of my memories are
from roughly 12,000 years ago

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:84%
when I walked on
initiatic path as a woman

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:84%
through the land of Kem,
which is now known as Egypt.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I have been weaving those
lessons into this life

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:90%
as I work with the planet.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:10%
Eight years ago, I was guided
to the island of Great Britain

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:10%
by the spirit of a Wise
Merlin from the Druid culture.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And he led my journey through
the ancient stone circle

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
to help me understand the
importance of the initiative

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:84%
path in the land
known in ancient times

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
as Avalon, the
Land of the Apples.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.985 align:middle line:84%
Now through the channel wisdom
of several ancient Merlins.

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:34.720 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.825 align:middle line:84%
Your wound is your forgotten
state of constant freedom.

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.855 align:middle line:84%
Expand your hearts
releasing your new power.

00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.630 align:middle line:84%
We will guide 45 people along
this ancient initiatic path.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Bring your true
self from the land.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And help heal wounds
within themselves.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.665 align:middle line:90%
Let it explode in your heart.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:16.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And reconnect with the
hidden power of this land.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.400 align:middle line:84%
All initiatic journeys are
designed to be remembered.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.740 align:middle line:10%
The past year 2022 for me
was the key of everything.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:10%
And it was like the summary
of a whole path of my life

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:10%
and the beginning of a new one.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So what I lived and
experienced that year

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
was like everything that
I was expecting for.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I was
waiting for so long.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
The year 2022 for me represented
the end of 12,000 years of task

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and the beginning of a
new 12,000 years of task.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I was very anxious on
how to live that year

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and how the gatherings and
the activations would be.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:10%
So after the path of the Dragon,
the path that I took around

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.180 align:middle line:10%
the consciousness of North
America, which was Utah,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.850 align:middle line:10%
I finished many
internal processes,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:10%
I had to wrap many
of the tasks that I

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:10%
did with some of the people.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:10%
I started to locate myself
in a new way of thinking

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:10%
on how everything would be.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And I basically understood the
purpose of the people around me

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:84%
who should be with
me doing my path,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.160 align:middle line:90%
the purpose of the gatherings.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And so for the next months
after I left the states,

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I started to work in the
organization for everything that

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:84%
would be the gathering
in Egypt 2022.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:10%
The gathering in Egypt for
me was something unexpected

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:10%
because I thought it
would be something,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:10%
but it actually was even more.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.400 align:middle line:90%
I thought less people would go.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
It would be much more difficult
because Egypt is very difficult

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.890 align:middle line:84%
to organize something like
an activation of the pyramids

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:90%
with thousands of people.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:90%
But everyone was helping.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was open to make it
possible, to make it happen.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:84%
We were as much respectful
as we could with the people

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that actually today live in
Egypt asking all the permissions

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to do everything that
we were about to do.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know anyone
could go to Egypt.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But for what we were
about to do in the context

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:84%
that we were doing
it, a lot of people

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
were scared of going
or not because it's

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:84%
a complicated country, and
even more for spiritual people.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
But actually we were
received very well as family.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And the country opened their
doors for us to do that.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.490 align:middle line:84%
When we opened this
space for the gathering,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:84%
people from all
over the world came.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.640 align:middle line:84%
It was, of course, the
last week of February.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:90%
It was during winter.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:84%
But it was very hot even though
and we organized everything

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:90%
in front of the pyramids.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:10%
The idea was to work in each
one of the Platonic solids

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:10%
every day.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was for each
one of us representing

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:90%
one of those structures.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So we divided it in five groups
for each one of the five solids.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And during the activations,
each one of them

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:84%
were creating an aspect
of that geometry.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So we were all
representing specifically

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
something dividing
in groups related

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:90%
to the frequency of the words.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So it was not just a
gathering to go and experience

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:90%
and me talking.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:84%
It was like every person had
a specific task to accomplish.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And if someone was
missing, we immediately

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:84%
needed to find someone
to go in its place

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
because it was not about
coming to an event.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.360 align:middle line:10%
It was about let's
form geometry.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:10%
So we needed the
specific nodes and lines

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:10%
to connect every step
of the information.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could be
missed inside the pyramid.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Everyone needed to be
represented because everyone

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:84%
was representing a node, a
frequency, and a geometry.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So the idea during those days
was to become the elements,

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
become the geometry,
and activate

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.755 align:middle line:90%
that inside of the pyramid.

00:07:27.755 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing
thing that happened

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.610 align:middle line:84%
was that when the
event was starting,

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.540 align:middle line:84%
I was waiting in my room
for them to call me.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, I was
watching through the window.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And this wind comes and
starts to blow everything.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:90%
It starts to be cloudy and dark.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
The wind came so
hard that it changed

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:90%
the temperature of everything.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And it blew the gate that we
have created for the event.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
It blew it and closed the
doors so nobody could get in.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:10%
So it was like the meaning of--

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.220 align:middle line:10%
we just started, this
is the beginning.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't handle myself
and I run to the event.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And everyone was trying to cover
because it started to rain.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:90%
And it rained a lot.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was like even
flooding in some parts.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So I was running in
between the people

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
like go move inside the dance
and jump and receive the water.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.434 align:middle line:90%
It's a blessing Egypt.

00:08:32.434 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:90%
It's like never rains here.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have to receive the
elements because we came here

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:90%
to become the elements.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:90%
And they all came together.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:84%
It was like a dust storm
with lightnings on the back

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:90%
and the wind and the rain.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So the beginning
was perfect, like it

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
was all the elements
dancing with us together

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:90%
and we celebrated all together.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And it got cold.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Everything was wet.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything was totally
different from Egypt.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So when we started with the
whole event, the sun came up

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:90%
and it was sunny every day.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So it was like the entrance of
the elements into our meeting...

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.240 align:middle line:90%
for them actually.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:84%
That was a very nice
confirmation of our task.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:10%
Since that day, we started to
enter the pyramid every night.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:84%
1,500 people, 100 people every
two hours entering the pyramid.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And I slept for three or four
nights inside the pyramid

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.650 align:middle line:90%
waiting for a group to enter.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.520 align:middle line:84%
We activated the
information, they went away,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.210 align:middle line:90%
and I received the others.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.780 align:middle line:10%
He was a very powerful--
very powerful activation

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:10%
of uploading the
information that we

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:06.790 align:middle line:10%
have been receiving during 2020,
2021, uploading it to the net.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was like this
task of accomplishing the rising

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:20.460 align:middle line:84%
energy of everything
that was under the soil,

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.620 align:middle line:84%
under the stones
in the territory,

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.595 align:middle line:90%
and put it all up again.

00:10:24.595 --> 00:10:25.395 align:middle line:90%
So expand.

00:10:25.395 --> 00:10:28.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We ended the event in
front of the Great Sphinx.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Around 2,000 people
around the Great Sphinx.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And we all received the sunrise
of this new beginning for us.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.510 align:middle line:10%
And the magical thing was that
the constellation of Aquarius

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:10%
was right behind the
sun as it was rising.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And the constellation
of Leo was exactly

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:84%
behind the lion,
the Great Sphinx.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a
reflection of that story

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to close.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
It was the perfect
balancing of everything

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:90%
that I was talking about.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea that, that
alignment was happening exactly

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:84%
in that moment when we
finished everything.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:10%
So that moment when
I saw 2,000 people

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:10%
that went there not just for
me or because I invited them,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:10%
but because they were
feeling that they

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:10%
needed to close something, and
that they needed to be there.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:10%
For me, it was very special
because when I was 12 years old,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:10%
the image was me and my husband
in front of the Great Sphinx

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:10%
saying, how can I bring
all these people back?

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:48.010 align:middle line:84%
How can I call them to say
we did it and we will start

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:84%
a new cycle and here we are in
order to begin something new,

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:90%
so that they happen.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And we were thousands
of people doing exactly

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.570 align:middle line:84%
that what I was worried about
when I was 12 years old.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.015 align:middle line:90%
So it was actually very cool.

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we
said, OK, this is over.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I
was 34 years old.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, it can't be over,
like there must be more things.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly we realized that
it was '22, the year was '22.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:33.830 align:middle line:10%
And it meant 11
years from our first

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.170 align:middle line:10%
gathering 11, 11 in Argentina.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:10%
So we started thinking maybe
we have to make the third.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:10%
So 11, 11, 11.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:10%
And that should
also wrap the task.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So we, immediately
after Egypt, started

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.130 align:middle line:84%
to organize the
11, 11 Argentina.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And we created exactly a mirror
event of what happened in Egypt.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to manifest it in
Argentina in Capilla Del Monte,

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%
like every gathering
we did before.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
The thing was that in Argentina,
we didn't have a pyramid.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So I said if in Egypt
the energy goes up

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.110 align:middle line:84%
towards the masculine
energy, so we

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:84%
have to make it in with the
feminine energy in the South.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:90%
So we created a dome.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:84%
We did a dome in a holy site for
the Henia-Kamiare tribe that was

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:90%
inside the place of the event.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.470 align:middle line:90%
So we asked for permission.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:10%
And there was like
a circle of water,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:10%
and we created this dome
with all mirrors inside.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:10%
So it reflected everything that
happened inside with the lights.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.270 align:middle line:84%
We call it the Hall of Mirrors,
because the underground city

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:84%
that is there, Eryx is usually
called the Hall of Mirrors.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to manifest
that a little bit at least.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:84%
We only had three
months to make it.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:90%
But the essence of that.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And to also use a
sacred place with water,

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:84%
like it was in Egypt, to
download all this information

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:90%
in this dome of mirrors.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So we divided the
groups exactly the same.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:84%
We did exactly the
same task every day

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
activating one of
the information.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And we brought
Egypt to Argentina.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:84%
There was a very old story
of a prophet in Argentina

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:90%
called Parravicini.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:54.050 align:middle line:10%
He had many messages
about Egypt in Argentina.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.220 align:middle line:10%
He was an artist.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:10%
So he painted all
these messages that he

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.610 align:middle line:10%
was receiving from aliens and
other dimensions in early 30s.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:10%
He put a series of channelings
that he did for many things that

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:10%
would happen in the future.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And many of the
messages there were

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.640 align:middle line:84%
about Egypt coming to
Argentina, Egypt being

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:90%
downloaded in Argentina.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.310 align:middle line:84%
The voices of Egypt will be
spoken in Argentina, the singing

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So these stories encourage
us to say we have to do that.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:84%
We have to bring that
information here.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
What was amazing
is that every day,

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:40.130 align:middle line:84%
it was a beautiful day
with sun, very hot.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And the last day with
the last activation,

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.530 align:middle line:84%
the opposite to
Egypt, the storm came.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:10%
And it was not only
a rain, it was hail.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:90%
And ice everywhere.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I said we need to bring the
ice for the information.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:10%
So the last night for
the last activation,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:10%
it was rain, hail, blue
lightnings all around.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:09.430 align:middle line:84%
It was so powerful what
happened with this activation.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:84%
The crazy thing is
that 5,000 people,

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:84%
we were dancing, running,
doing activities in this land.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a concert.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:24.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like you step on the grass
and everything gets like dirt.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But the magical thing was
that after that next day,

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
instead of just being like
nothing, it was all green.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:90%
But not only that.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:84%
It started to blossom
everywhere white lilies.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And the white lily is
the flower of Egypt.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:84%
The whole land where people were
stepping on, right the next day,

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:90%
it was all white lilies.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And looked into the internet,
which type of flower

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.260 align:middle line:90%
is this one?

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:90%
And said Egyptian lily.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.520 align:middle line:90%
So it was like magical.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
It was incredible
what happened and we

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.530 align:middle line:90%
were taking pictures to look.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:90%
It's like a confirmation.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It hailed, rained,
people running.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.839 align:middle line:84%
The whole mess of
an organization.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly the next day,
it was a beautiful place

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:20.280 align:middle line:84%
like if nothing happened the day
before all blossomed in white.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.619 align:middle line:90%
And it was beautiful.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
After the 11, 11
was robbed, what

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I felt was that the
whole idea of everything

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:40.060 align:middle line:84%
that I had to do for 2022,
which was what my guides have

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:90%
been preparing me for 22 years.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:90%
It finished.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.460 align:middle line:90%
And it was perfect.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly in a personal
level, all the things

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:84%
that I have been creating
in the past 11 years,

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.270 align:middle line:90%
suddenly they all disappear.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
The foundation, the work
that we have been doing,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:10.558 align:middle line:84%
everything was like the
energy disappeared from there.

00:18:10.558 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:84%
There have been
many inner conflicts

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:84%
due to everything that
happened in 2022 that made

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.750 align:middle line:90%
me think this is a total reset.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.810 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I had to take tough decisions
related to everything

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:90%
that I have been doing.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And to say next year, we
will start from zero again.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And everything that we have
been building until now

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:84%
was for 2022 with the
energy that we had in 2011.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:46.420 align:middle line:10%
And what I felt was that all
the people that we were engaged

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:10%
into that task that had
to be done in that year,

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.710 align:middle line:10%
we all signed up
for a new cycle.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:84%
A new cycle that in this time
wouldn't be karmic or saying we

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.115 align:middle line:84%
have to do it,
otherwise we would

00:19:03.115 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:90%
lost something or whatever.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
We sign up for this
saying, we want

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to be part of something
different, of something new,

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and create a new idea
that could make us

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:90%
transcend in a different way.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to
create everything

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.770 align:middle line:90%
with a totally different energy.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And to manifest new things
according to the new process.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Now it's like I'm free to
create my mission, my purpose,

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:84%
everything that I know
that I have to do,

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.810 align:middle line:84%
but without the weight
of 12,000 years.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:84%
What could have been
horrible of ending everything

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.570 align:middle line:90%
for me was like perfect.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It was amazing because
everything ends in order

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:90%
for something new to begin.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I felt
when 2023 started.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:90%
