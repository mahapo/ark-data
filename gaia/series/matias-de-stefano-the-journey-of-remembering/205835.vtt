>> My name is Matias De Stefano.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.770 align:middle line:90%
And my purpose is to remember.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.470 align:middle line:84%
At a young age, I
began to remember

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.170 align:middle line:84%
living in a colony of
the ancient civilization

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.280 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Then I'd begun to remember
living on other planets,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:84%
in other star systems
and dimensions.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I started to understand
how everything I remember

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:84%
has a purpose in my mission
here and now, to help reconnect

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
the network of consciousness
of planet Earth in a plan

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
that in Atlantis we called Ater
Tumti, bring heaven on Earth.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:84%
This mission began
with organizing

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:84%
a gathering of thousands of
people to create that network.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:90%
This is my mission.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I hope it helps you find yours.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:10%
When the day of the
gathering arrived,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:10%
it was really heavy because
my mom and other friends

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:10%
were organizing the
gathering for 400 people.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:10%
And we did all these
videos to invite the people

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:10%
from the world.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.538 align:middle line:90%
But we had some problems.

00:01:34.538 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Capilla del Monte was ruled
by a group of original people.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:84%
They hold the information
of the underground cities.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't give
any permission

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:84%
to any white person that
would come to the mountains

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and say, I'm here to
work for this and that,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:90%
like we were trying to do.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:90%
So they were pushing us out.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want us to be
part of their information.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So we had to go
through many tests

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:84%
that they gave us to heal
some spots in the region

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.221 align:middle line:84%
so they could accept us
and allow us to go inside,

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.610 align:middle line:90%
inside the mountains.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So when we did all
this process, they

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:84%
allowed us to go
to the main portal

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.060 align:middle line:90%
to a place called Ongamira.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And after all the stories that
we lived in that mountain,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I accomplished to sit in a
cave where I was able to see,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:84%
in the other side, how these
other beings were seated.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And we started to talk about
how the gathering would be.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:84%
They told me at what
times, which meditations,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:84%
what to do the first day,
what to do the second day

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:90%
and third day.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.150 align:middle line:10%
They explained
all the logistics,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:10%
who we had to invite,
everything that we had to do.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that they said

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
was that this gathering
would be the 11th,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:84%
but the result of
all of this would

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:90%
be the day 13, November 13.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:84%
They told me to choose
the darkest place

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:84%
to do the gathering
of Capilla del Monte

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:84%
because we needed to
prove that we could change

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
the energy of a place, that we
could really transform and work

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:84%
together the darkness
and the light

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:90%
and to make something different.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And what they said
was that the last day,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:84%
the four elements
would come and would

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:90%
clean the energy of the place.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So the 11th, you
can do everything.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
I guess that the
most important story

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.150 align:middle line:84%
of what happened
during the organization

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.420 align:middle line:84%
was that it's been many months
without water in that region.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't raining at all since
the beginning of the year.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And people was very concerned
because the gathering was

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:84%
getting bigger and bigger,
and all these people

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have water.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And that same week, the 400
people gathering became 6,000.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, 6,000 people
appeared from nowhere.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea from where
they came, so many people.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And from 23 different
countries, they

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.470 align:middle line:84%
came to Capilla del Monte
because of the call.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.350 align:middle line:84%
They decided to ban
the gathering just

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.805 align:middle line:90%
one day before it started.

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the mountains,
and I spoke to these beings.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm here to
do whatever I have to do.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:90%
But this is too much.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:90%
I can't handle this.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what we have to do.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And the beings said,
we are the ones

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
that will take the garbage
out if it's necessary.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:90%
So don't worry about that.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.050 align:middle line:90%
You just keep organizing.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So we went back to
the main village

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:84%
with this idea of,
the garbage away.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, the people
in charge of the garbage,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.770 align:middle line:90%
the city, they were in threat.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So garbage was all around,
and it was horrible,

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%
a whole mess in the city.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And we went back
and did a ceremony

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
to make the cleanings in the
main square of the village.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.225 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly we heard gunshots.

00:05:36.225 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And we run to the gun shots
to see where it was happening.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
were taking the garbage,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:90%
they broke the city hall.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:90%
And they took away the mayor.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.236 align:middle line:84%
So they signed the permission
to do the gathering.

00:05:56.236 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So during the
gathering, 11/11/11,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:90%
there was no government.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
cleans the city

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:84%
were the ones in charge
of the city hall.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And we were waiting for
the beginning of the 11/11.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Then the four elements start
to clean the whole city,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:84%
like a big wind that came and
went through all the city,

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:84%
changing the energy of
the whole environment.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the sun's
setting in the mountains.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And the lightning that
burned the top of the hill,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:90%
setting fire in the mountain.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And then rain made it disappear,
and suddenly the stars.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a cleaning
through the four elements.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, everything
was ready for the beginning

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:90%

So that day, in the morning, we
had these 6,000 people coming.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:84%
It was like if everyone arrived,
knowing what they have to do.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:02.300 align:middle line:84%
following Oceania, Asia, Europe,
North America, Central America,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:90%
South America, and Antarctica.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Where you have to deliver
keys in the specific

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:84%
portals to open the
Kundalini of the world.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you have to
do that from February 7, 2012

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.460 align:middle line:90%
until December 21, 2012.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:90%
That's the last day.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be in
Antarctica that day.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But they said, you accomplished
to open the portal in 11/11/11.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is why, tomorrow,
you will celebrate.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:90%
This is a celebration.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And because of what you
did, what you all did,

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:90%
you will receive the blessing.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
what they were talking

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:84%
about until the
next day when we,

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:84%
the last people that stayed
in the gathering, we all

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.380 align:middle line:90%
went together.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
beings from the city,

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:84%
from the underground city,
started to talk through me.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And he or she was saying
that we have come here

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.650 align:middle line:84%
to be like seats, to receive
the information from the skies

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and to be grounded on the
Earth so we could create

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:90%
this forest of consciousness.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:84%
She just rise her hands
to the skies and say,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:84%
don't be afraid to receive the
gift and when she pulled down,

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:90%
it started to rain.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:84%
It was so much water that the
rivers, everything started

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.780 align:middle line:90%
to fill in just one day.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:84%
All the people were
dancing under the water.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And the nature started
to be green again.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:84%
It was something so
incredible because nobody

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:90%
was expecting rain that day.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.450 align:middle line:90%
It was supposed to be sunny.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:06.110 align:middle line:84%
When that happened, I knew so
that I had only three months

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:90%
to start with this trip.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:84%
In just three months, I had
to take all the possible visas

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.920 align:middle line:84%
to raise the money to bring four
people in 40 countries in only

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.240 align:middle line:90%
six months.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And even to accomplish to get
to Antarctica in just one day.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.270 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea how to do it.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea where
I was supposed to go.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
They only say-- the only
thing that they said was,

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:90%
you have to go to these regions.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I found three people
in Argentina and Peru

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.720 align:middle line:84%
that were willing to
help me with money

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:90%
to go to those places.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And someone in Capilla del
Monte made these keys in copper

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle line:84%
to open the portals, while
these keys were, like,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.290 align:middle line:90%
the symbol of the trip.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%
They represented
every door that I

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be opening
in every chakra of the planet

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:90%
and giving it to the Earth.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.400 align:middle line:84%
But also, I had to
make all the visas

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.480 align:middle line:84%
in just one week, which
are really complicated

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:90%
in Argentina.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
funny things of this

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:84%
was that my guides told
me, again, don't lie.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:84%
When the ambassador
asked me, what are you

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:90%
going to do in the States?

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I just said, I'm going to
open a portal of the throat

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.480 align:middle line:90%
chakra of the world.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do
that, I need to speak

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:84%
with the water of
the three lakes

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:90%
and then to the Grand Canyon.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:44.642 align:middle line:84%
And so he stared at me
like, are you kidding?

00:13:44.642 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:90%
What are you saying?

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, no,
that's the truth.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.355 align:middle line:84%
And who is going
to pay for that?

00:13:50.355 --> 00:13:51.525 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:51.525 --> 00:13:53.820 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
money, and you say

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:84%
you are going to work
with another dimension?

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes, basically,
that's the truth.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And the ambassador said,
I have no idea why,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:84%
but I will leave you to
go to the States anyway.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So in just one week, I got
all the visas of every country

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:84%
that I needed, something
that was impossible to do.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And I began the trip
in the Canary Islands

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:84%
because it was the main spot
from where the Atlanteans

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:90%
started to wake their network.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So I went there because
the seven islands

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:90%
represented the seven chakras.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.380 align:middle line:90%
So I did one island per day.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So in just one week, I
did the seven islands.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of introducing
myself, like this is me.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:90%
This is my energy.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And I will go to this continent
so the energy would accept me

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.220 align:middle line:90%
in every place I would go.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So we started to
go to South Africa,

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:84%
to Adam's Calendar and all
the region in Johannesburg

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and Waterval Boven,
the ancient main spots

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:84%
of the first
connection of humanity.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And from there, New
Zealand to Australia

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
to Uluru, the great rock, to
anchor this energy of the most

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:90%
ancient humans.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.080 align:middle line:84%
We started to travel
to all these places

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.580 align:middle line:90%
to go to Lake Baikal.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.658 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.658 --> 00:15:51.780 align:middle line:10%
[SPANISH SPEAKING]

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:10%
And to go to Japan.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:16:26.330 align:middle line:10%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:90%
And from there, Nepal.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:10%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I ran out of money
because we had no organization,

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.470 align:middle line:90%
we had nothing.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I was just a kid,
traveling around the world.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.470 align:middle line:84%
People were following a
blog that I was writing.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we want to
give you money to keep going.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we had no idea
how, all the people started

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:90%
to donate to my travel agency.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew that every day,
I had the new ticket to go.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But I had no idea from
where the money came from.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And this path started to
take me to the Middle East,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.096 align:middle line:84%
going to the ancient
pyramids in Egypt.

00:17:33.096 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:10%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:84%
During the trip, the
other three persons

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
that were traveling with
me, they had to go back.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And the whole America, from
Canada until Patagonia,

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I was alone, by myself,
doing this trip.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And all this experience of going
and talking to the mountains,

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:90%
it made a lot of sense.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
In each country, there
were so many adventures.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:84%
But in each country,
also, I lost faith,

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:90%
and I got frustrated.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:90%
And then I was rising again.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly what
I understood was

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
that my path was also showing
to the people their own path.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.735 align:middle line:84%
It was not just about going
and opening the portals

00:18:40.735 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and to give the
keys to the world

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:49.270 align:middle line:84%
so the portals of the energy
would be opening in the future.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But it felt more like all my
inner process and the stories

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:84%
that I was leaving
were helping people

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
I was going through

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and what it was to
connect the world.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:90%
They were part of this.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So many of the people
started to travel

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:90%
to create all this network.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was traveling around.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:90%
I never asked that.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:10%
But somehow, they started
to organize themselves

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:10%
to do the meditations, to
share their own stories,

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:10%
to make these groups.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we create
this network of Harwitum.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I was doing the
connection and meditation.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And from behind me, there
comes this native people

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:84%
with an arrow and a bow and
another one with a sword

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:90%
and other one with a gun.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:10%
And they kidnapped me.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.067 align:middle line:90%
