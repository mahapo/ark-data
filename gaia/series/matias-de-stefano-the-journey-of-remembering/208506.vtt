>> The universe was
made with questions.

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And you think you are
here to bring answers.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
that opens the mind

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.544 align:middle line:90%
is the question, not the answer.

00:00:32.544 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
You are here to
bring consciousness

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.025 align:middle line:90%
on the question, not the answer.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Once Roma Amor finished,
I had no clue what

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:90%
was the next step, no idea.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So I came back home and kind
of waited for what to do.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But something since
a long time ago

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
got stuck in my head related to
what some beings in Aconcagua

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Mountain told me
in 2011, which was

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:84%
to unite people with very
different points of view,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:90%
to work together.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:10%
And I said, what
is all this about?

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.830 align:middle line:10%
And they said, your
real mission, ontocracy.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So I was trying to
look for what it meant.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:90%
So in Greek, ontos means being.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:90%
It's the self, the one self.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.500 align:middle line:90%
And cratos, cracy, is power--

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:90%
so the power of the being.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:84%
We are used to hearing
the concept of democracy,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:84%
which is the power
of the people, demos

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:90%
which is the population.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And after we did
Roma Amor, I said,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:84%
we have to do
something with this.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to create
something for ontocracy

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and try to design a new society,
something transcendental,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:84%
something new that gives
the power back to the being,

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.130 align:middle line:90%
not to the people.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So I was wondering how it's
possible to do something new,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:90%
something different like that.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And my guides told
me, well, Greek people

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:90%
didn't have internet.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And today, each one
of the individuals

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.640 align:middle line:84%
has the possibility
to have a word,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
to have a choice to do
it not with someone that

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.980 align:middle line:84%
represents them in a
Congress or parliament

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
That was an old
idea because that's

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:84%
the only way a lot of people
can be represented in power.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But today, you
can make projects,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and people can help you
accomplish that project

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:90%
besides the government.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So a new way of thinking
is going to come,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:84%
but in order for that to work,
each one of the individuals

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:84%
must recognize what
is the inner power

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:84%
to know what is their
part in all this.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So we have to prepare the ontos,
the being, in order to do it.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream when I was
designing all this that I

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.800 align:middle line:90%
was in the middle of nowhere.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
There was no one
there like a desert.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It was a land of no one.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's
the perfect place.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:84%
That would be a perfect
place if that place exists.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote in the internet
"a place of no one"

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and came up a concept of Latin
times, the Roman Empire, which

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:90%
was terra nullius.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Terra nullius means
a land of no one.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But there's only two or
three places in the world

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
that still today are weird,
because they are terra nullius.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:90%
And one of them is in Egypt.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:84%
That land is called
Bir Tawil, and it's

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
100 kilometers from the Nile
in the middle of the desert.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, maybe I should
go there and do something.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So I was trying to figure
out the ways in which I could

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:84%
do this ontocracy in
a place where there's

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:84%
no constitution, where we could
start from the very beginning.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, I
discovered that there

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.340 align:middle line:84%
was a farmer from Virginia
that put a flag on it

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and declare it the
kingdom of North Sudan.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, I
have to meet him.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I have to have a meeting
with him and say,

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:84%
if you already declare
it, you made a step

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:84%
before so we can do
something different.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So I contact this
person from Virginia

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and we agreed to have a
meeting in Washington, DC.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:84%
In that time, I had no clue
what I was going to do.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any purpose
that I thought in my mind.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing
congresses and people

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:90%
were inviting me to do stuff.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And they invited me to
a congress in Miami.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So I accepted because I wanted
to go to Washington, DC.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was my way
to come to the States.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing was
that that same year,

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.670 align:middle line:90%
I started to know my father.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of in touch with
him but not really close.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So he wanted to know
me a little bit better.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So he said, whenever
you have another trip,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I would love to
go with you so we

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:84%
can travel together
and share and whatever.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, I have
this trip to Miami.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But I said, I have
no clue what is

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:84%
going to happen
because I go to Miami,

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:84%
but then I have to
go to Washington, DC,

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:84%
to meet the king of a
country that doesn't exist.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:90%
And his face was like, what?

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.795 align:middle line:90%
Like, OK, I'll go anyway.

00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So in the congress, there
were 700 people listening

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.640 align:middle line:90%
about what I was saying.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And after this meeting, a
lady came to me and said,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:90%
I need to talk to you.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I come from the
Confederation, the Galactic

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Confederation, in behalf
of Ashtar Sheran, who

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:84%
is the one in charge of the
fleet of the Confederation

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:90%
around these planets.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said, they told me
to tell you that in June 21,

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:84%
you have to be in Amantani
Island in Peru, the Lake

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Titicaca, which was next week.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So I said, that's
impossible because I

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
have to go to LA because I
have a meeting with someone,

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and those days is
the meeting in LA.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you have to
be there for the meeting.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing was that
when she left, my dad said,

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:90%
who was this crazy lady?

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Like, what is the
Galactic Confederation,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:90%
and what is happening?

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:90%
And I said, don't worry.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just aliens, and
I'm working with them.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So he just wanted to
play golf and have fun,

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.900 align:middle line:84%
but he ended up
in an alien story.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we went to
Washington, DC,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:90%
for the meeting with this king.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So we met with this person under
the Obelisk because I said,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:90%
it should be a special spot.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:10%
So we had this meeting
walking around the Obelisk

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.200 align:middle line:10%
in Washington, DC.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
It was very different
points of view

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that we had of what was
meant to be with that land

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and what Egypt represents for
the origin of civilizations

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and the origin of
a new civilization.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was like,
we have to take

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.580 align:middle line:90%
this opportunity that is Egypt.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not anywhere else.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a good place
to start a concept

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.560 align:middle line:90%
of what is a new civilization.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't get the idea
what I was trying to say.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:84%
And I was not good at English at
that time to explain all this.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.470 align:middle line:90%
So we just left.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And again, my dad not
understanding anything

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.200 align:middle line:84%
said, I have no clue about
what you're talking about,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think this
is going anywhere.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:90%
So I took his earthly advice.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:90%
So I said, yeah, you're right.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to LA and
see what happens there.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment,
I received a call,

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
canceled in LA.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So my dad said,
so where do we go?

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, there's
only one answer, Peru.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, my dad was on an
airplane flying to Peru--

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:84%
he had only clothes for summer,
and I took him 4,000 meters

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.700 align:middle line:90%
above sea in winter.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So he was flying and saying,
why are we going there?

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
No, I have to go to a
temple, which is Pachatata,

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.002 align:middle line:90%
the Temple of the Father.

00:09:38.002 --> 00:09:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize
at that moment

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:90%
that I was going with my father.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Pachatata is a temple on the
top of Amantani Island in Peru

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:90%
in the Lake Titicaca.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So we arrived to Puno to take
a boat to go to the island.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:90%
In the island, there's nothing.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.960 align:middle line:84%
They just receive
you in their houses

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.240 align:middle line:84%
because there's
no hotel, nothing.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So we arrived there,
and I dressed him

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:84%
like a Quechua person
because that was the only way

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:90%
to keep him warm.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So I did everything all the
opposite that he would like to,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:90%
but he was kind of having fun.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So we went there with
other two friends

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:84%
to Amantani Island, and the
21st, early in the morning,

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.730 align:middle line:84%
we had to go to
Pachatata on the top

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.680 align:middle line:84%
to have this meeting with
aliens that weren't there

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:84%
because they were in hologram
in another dimension.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:90%
And only me could see them.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we went up
there, and I said,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
you have to come with me because
it's the Temple of the Father.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And in South America,
it's the Father's Day.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So it was the Father's
Day in the Temple

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.800 align:middle line:84%
of the Father with my
father and receiving

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:84%
one of the fathers
of the Confederation.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So I had no clue what
was all that about.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And the message was,
in order to follow

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:84%
what you are trying to do and
what you are meant to do here,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:17.470 align:middle line:84%
you have to accept
the father in you.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:90%
And I say, which father?

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the
father of the universe,

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:84%
the energy that represents
the father of all things.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized in
that moment that I was

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.350 align:middle line:90%
raised with women all my life.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And for me was Earth all
the time so Mother Earth.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing everything
for Mother Earth.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:84%
According to my memories, that
was a matriarchal society.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And everything was
related to the mother,

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:90%
and the father was not there.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I was
missing this other energy

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:90%
in order to do my mission.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why I needed
my father there

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:84%
in the Temple of the
Father so the DNA can

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.820 align:middle line:84%
be matched with that and
do a reconnection with all

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:90%
this energy that I never had.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So it was all perfect
for that reconnection.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And the second step
after that reconnection

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.420 align:middle line:84%
that I received in
that moment was,

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:84%
you will be guided to do the
connection with the being,

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:28.430 align:middle line:84%
with your feminine and masculine
sides in balance both together.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But before, you have
to go to Machu Picchu

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:90%
to follow instructions.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.430 align:middle line:10%
So we went to Machu
Picchu, a place

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:10%
that my dad said I
would never go there.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.090 align:middle line:90%
So I took him there again.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And when we were there
staring in the place,

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:84%
the message was go
to this waterfall.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:84%
We went there, and there, we
received information of Egypt.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
They said, you have
to go to Egypt.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And I just came from this
idea, oh, the land in Egypt.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.600 align:middle line:90%
So maybe I have to go there.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I have to go to South Egypt and
to do something with the flag

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:90%
and put another flag.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, whatever.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:90%
But maybe I have to go there.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And my guides told me,
you have to go to Egypt

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.130 align:middle line:90%
to receive the next information.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:90%
And you have to be prepared.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.470 align:middle line:90%
And I said, when?

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:90%
And they said on your birthday.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.835 align:middle line:84%
And I received a message
from a friend saying,

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:22.960 align:middle line:90%
do you want to go to Egypt?

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.381 align:middle line:90%
I'll pay everything.

00:13:24.381 --> 00:13:29.300 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So I went, and I invited
three friends of mine

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:84%
to accompany me so I wouldn't
be alone not knowing what to do.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had no clue about what
was expecting to be there.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So they said, maybe
what we should

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
do is to make
something different,

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.560 align:middle line:84%
not to stay in the pyramids,
but to go to the temples.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And I have never been in the
temples before in this life.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So we arranged to go on a cruise
to every one of the temples

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:90%
as my birthday present.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So we start to travel
there, and suddenly, I

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:90%
start to feel like I was home.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:90%
I start to feel like it was OK.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Visiting the
temples made me feel

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:84%
like I was not
running or feeling

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:84%
the wrong part of
Egypt because I usually

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.050 align:middle line:90%
went to Cairo, which is a mess.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:84%
But the South is so calm, and
the temples are so beautiful,

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and there's all this
desert and green.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So it was very different,
and suddenly, I

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:84%
could feel myself that
I was in my country,

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:90%
that I was where I used to live.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So the energy
changed completely.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.660 align:middle line:84%
My relationship
with Egypt was going

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
through every one of the temples
like if I was going through

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
remember, yes, this

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:84%
is what we have done always
before going to the pyramid.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I made the mistake of going
to the pyramid before,

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.990 align:middle line:84%
but before you go
to the pyramids,

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
you have to do the
path, the initiatic path

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:90%
through the Nile.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.370 align:middle line:90%
So that time was perfect.

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I was connecting with that,
connecting with the territory

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:84%
before asking for permission
in every one of the temples,

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:84%
feeling the energy
of some priests

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and priestesses and
masters there that

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:84%
were guiding me to
be ready for what is

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:90%
going to happen in the pyramid.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And I had no clue what
was expecting to me.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So for my birthday, I
felt completely grounded

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:52.690 align:middle line:84%
in the territory, and it was
like if my past self 12,000

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:84%
years ago and my personality
today were matching,

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.200 align:middle line:90%
and I was feeling, again, there.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Like, this is me.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:84%
This is all I am from
the past and the present.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And so once I felt
that, the day August 8,

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:84%
the same friend gave
me the opportunity

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.460 align:middle line:84%
to be alone inside the
pyramid for two hours.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I had no clue that you
could rent the pyramid.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:90%
That's something new.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we rented the
pyramid, and the four of us

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.220 align:middle line:84%
got inside during the night
not knowing what to do,

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:90%
what to expect.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.460 align:middle line:10%
When we were there,
each one of us

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:10%
went to the main chamber, the
King's chambers, they call it.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we
just start to breathe

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and felt all this huge
amount of energy coming up.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And that pushed me to
sing with some sounds

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly to sing.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it
was not me anymore,

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and there was someone else
singing through me an old song

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:90%
in Atlantean language.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And the song was so beautiful
that eventually the other three

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:84%
started to sing, too,
in different levels

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
like different parts of the
song, not with the language

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.150 align:middle line:90%
but with singing.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it felt
like we were 200 people

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:90%
inside the pyramid singing.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I started
to be someone else,

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.730 align:middle line:90%
a very hard presence.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And a name started to be
there like Dhjahut, Serapis,

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and many names that I have no
clue about, names of people

00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:84%
that I have never been in touch
with before, beings and masters

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:04.630 align:middle line:90%
that I never felt the presence.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Kwan Yin, I had no clue who
she was, but she was there.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And other people from other
parts of the world, masters,

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that they would start to
talk, and there was Djahut,

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:84%
opening in the middle
of us like a sphere

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and start to show me all the
network and how to connect it

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and where are the spots and
show me the entire network

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness of
the planet, showing me

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:84%
how many people are doing
the job of connecting it

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:90%
and what was my task in that.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And then every master
was telling something

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.190 align:middle line:84%
different to complete the
data, the information that I

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to
receive for that moment

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:84%
because I was asking what I am
supposed to do with all this.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And his presence was there, and
a feminine presence was there,

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:90%
and many others start to appear.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said, say
with me, "I am".

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:90%
And he start, "I am the path.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:90%
I am the light.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.650 align:middle line:90%
I am."

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And everyone started to say
this in different languages like

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:25.860 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] and all the
languages start to resound all

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:90%
together saying, "I am.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:90%
I am."

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the I am
became only one word

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.079 align:middle line:84%
that resounded
perfectly in the center.

00:19:35.079 --> 00:19:38.991 align:middle line:10%
[CHANTING]

00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.500 align:middle line:10%
And they said from
now on, the only way

00:19:53.500 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:10%
to bring the power back to
the self is by saying "I am".

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:84%
That was how I
understood and saw

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
that I had to bring the
message of the "I am"

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
again like many others are doing
into this spot of the planet.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And each one of the
masters were saying

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.240 align:middle line:90%
their part of how to do it.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
One's just saying
through love, say I am.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:84%
The other one's saying, you
have to go here, there, there,

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:26.180 align:middle line:90%
This is the way.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And so they gave
me all the planning

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:37.420 align:middle line:84%
for the next seven years in
that moment, in those two hours.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And I saw all the places
I was supposed to go.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.265 align:middle line:84%
I saw a lot of people that
I had no clue who they were,

00:20:45.265 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:84%
but they said, these
people are the ones that

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.710 align:middle line:90%
will help you do this or that.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So it was like complete
information and just trust.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:21:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So when I saw all
this, I came back home,

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and I brought all this
planning for seven years.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Like, we have to do all of this.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, from not
having anything to do,

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:84%
not knowing exactly what to
do, we have all this to do.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And the master said, you
cannot build a new society

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.710 align:middle line:84%
if the people living in that
society don't know who they

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you cannot work
on building a society before you

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:84%
have to remember that
society who they are.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's I am, I am.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:43.015 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in August 8, 2015,
I started the I Am Project.

00:21:43.015 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:84%
In that pass, you reach almost
7,000 meters above sea level.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:84%
The guide was always asking
me, have you a headache?

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.670 align:middle line:90%
And I said no.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:10%
And they said, because a Russian
guy was crossing and just died.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:07.000 align:middle line:90%
