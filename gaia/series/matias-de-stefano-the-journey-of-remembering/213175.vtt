[AUDIO LOGO]

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Eight years ago, I was guided
to the island of Great Britain

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.100 align:middle line:90%
by the spirit of a wise merlin.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:10%
And I was led through
the stone circles

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:10%
that represented a connection.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:10%
So Nine Ladies was for sure
part of that initiative path.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And Nine Ladies is
a very tiny circle

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:84%
that is hidden in the
middle of the mountains

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:90%
in the center of England.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And I felt this
feminine power there,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.950 align:middle line:84%
which eventually I felt
this is part of a path

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:84%
that I have to do
something with this.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.424 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I started to
bring people to this circle.

00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
This circle is called like that,
because the old tradition says

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
that Nine Ladies were
dancing a Sunday around

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the forest.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And because it was God's Day,
they weren't supposed to dance.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.100 align:middle line:90%
So God turned them into stones.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, that's
not the actual story.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
It's describing
basically a circle

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.980 align:middle line:84%
of feminine reunions,
where the witches used

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:90%
to gather in that forest.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's a place where the
feminine used to get together

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.456 align:middle line:90%
to discuss, talk, celebrate.

00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:54.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But the initiative
path in Great Britain

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:90%
was not like the one in Egypt.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, was more like
an obligated step-by-step

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.729 align:middle line:84%
that you had to do in
order to get to somewhere.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
In Great Britain, was much
more about going to the center.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So it was not that everyone had
to go through a line specific

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:90%
to connect.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Most of the places were about to
connect with the circle itself.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't exist an
actual initiatic path

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:84%
that obligated people to
go from one to the other.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:84%
The idea of going to the
plexus of Great Britain

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.610 align:middle line:90%
is to balance the feminine ego.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
The ego has two
different aspects.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
One expands outside and
the other one contracts

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:90%
to the within.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
The one that expands
towards the outside

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:84%
is the feminine ego, which is
the one related to everyone

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:90%
with the creation itself.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Animals, plants, humans.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.270 align:middle line:84%
The ego of the feminine is
spread because of the division

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:90%
of the feminine.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:84%
The aspect of creation in
the cosmos is feminine,

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:84%
so it means that unity has
been divided into many in order

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:90%
to create.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
feminine energy is

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:84%
one ego that is spread all
over in every living being.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why that part of the
ego is the one that connects us

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:84%
with everyone around, the one
that makes us feel, connect,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
perceive, take care of everyone
who is alive in this planet.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And the masculine
ego is the opposite.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that
brings everything

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:84%
from the outside to
understand itself,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:90%
to be referred to the one.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And so putting all
these different hearts

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:90%
together in unity again.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why the ego
of the feminine

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
usually is about
taking care of others

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
or invading the space of others,
trying to control their lives

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:90%
through emotion.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And the ego-- the egoistic
movement of the masculine

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:84%
is grabbing everyone
towards oneself

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and being in
control of everyone.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:84%
In this process of
Nine Ladies, the idea

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
was to recognize the power of
being connected to every living

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:84%
The power of the feminine,
which is expansive.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.050 align:middle line:84%
The power of being able to
communicate and to become

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:90%
the everything.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Not just as being
one with everything,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:84%
but being able to channel
the everything, so being

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.980 align:middle line:84%
able to become an
animal, to become a tree,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
to become the plant in order
to understand the medicine that

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:84%
is within, to understand
the wind by dancing.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.880 align:middle line:84%
So these are the things that
usually witches were doing.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And before the
witches, the priestess.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Priestesses were
the feminine aspect

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:84%
of the divine that embody
this creation, the expansion.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they were forbidden,
because the feminine were

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.880 align:middle line:84%
so powerful that the
masculine side of history

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.010 align:middle line:90%
decided to shut them up.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So what they started to do
was to gather in forests

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and to do their
potions and dancings

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and ceremonies
hidden from the men.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
became witches.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So this witch
energy is something

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:84%
that connects us with the
expansion of this nature,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
to know how to use the nature,
how to use everything around,

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.495 align:middle line:84%
and how to become
everything around.

00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
The idea in the circle was
to allow the feminine aspect

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
of each one of us to
connect with that power,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:84%
with the power of saying,
I am the everything,

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and I can be expanded
in every living creature

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.045 align:middle line:84%
and become every
living creature.

00:06:11.045 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:84%
After the Nine
Ladies, the next step

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.210 align:middle line:84%
was Brimham Rocks, which
is a national park.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's a special place because
for me, it was a druid school.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It was a natural
place where people

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:84%
used to go to receive
teachings, and to learn

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:90%
how to read the books of Earth.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a very special place that
the first time that I went

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:84%
there, I was led
into these rocks,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit of the
place told me here

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%
is a place where we taught the
masculine how to read nature

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and how to become masters
of their own reality.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:84%
The main idea of
the message that I

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:84%
wanted to transmit in Brimham
Rocks was about detachment.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:84%
In the spiritual world, usually
we hear the term detachment

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:84%
as something that is the main
key to become a spiritual.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So the idea of detachment
actually is related to how

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:84%
nature in a tree, for
example, lets the leaves,

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and the fruits to fall
down during autumn.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And in that process of autumn,
it earns power and energy

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
within that allows the tree
to grow bigger and even much

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:90%
more stronger.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So the process of detachment is
a process of becoming richer,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.350 align:middle line:84%
because you are offering in
order to gain space for the new.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Like we need to release
our physical world in order

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:90%
to become spiritual.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is usually
related to not willing

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:84%
to have materialistic
things or not

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
earning money for some
actions that we do.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Spiritual things should be free.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:90%
And this kind of things.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:84%
When we look into most of
the traditions, the priests,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.670 align:middle line:84%
the priestesses, that have
been in a spiritual path,

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.660 align:middle line:84%
they had to let go all
their previous lives and all

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:84%
their materialistic reality in
order to become part of the one,

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.870 align:middle line:90%
of the divine.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But the rocks, what
they are teaching

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.215 align:middle line:84%
is how the process of
detachment really works.

00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:35.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Detachment is not that you
have to get rid of everything

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:90%
in order to become spiritual.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Detachment means that you
have to give something away

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:84%
in order to receive
something new,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
in order to have balance
in the process of creation.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Detachment means that in order
to be able to read yourself

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
in a deeper level,
you have to get rid

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.040 align:middle line:84%
of the sand, the soil that is
covering the rocks, the crystals

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:90%
that are within you.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Another analogy would be how the
trees get rid of the flowers,

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
get rid of the leaves
every autumn, every fall.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So they could have much
more strength and power

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:84%
for new leaves and new
flowers to be created.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
finding light means

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:84%
to leave all the
flowers on the leaves,

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:37.560 align:middle line:84%
or to get rid of every crystal
and rock of the mountain.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:84%
It's about all
these dirty things

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.750 align:middle line:84%
that are not very useful
for us, but that maybe they

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.670 align:middle line:90%
are very useful for others.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And that we don't need
them because they actually

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
are kept because we are
afraid of losing our security.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Because when we release
our inner power,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
we are open for everyone
to see the truth of us.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we are scared of showing
to the world who we really are,

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:84%
we try to cover that with a lot
of things that we don't need.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So the spiritual thing is
to release all these things

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that you don't actually
need to protect yourself,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:84%
actually to release the
power that you have within.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And in order for you to shine,
you need to let some things go.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you let
those things go,

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.610 align:middle line:84%
you start to have more energy
and power to receive new things.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So detachment is about
releasing in order to receive.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not about just
letting go and be nothing.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:84%
After the teachings
of Brimham Rocks,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
we were led to
Druid's Temple, which

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:84%
is the place where we actually
had to give the ceremony.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Druid's Temple was not an
ancient temple, actually.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It was built in
the 17th century.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
The first time that I went
there to Druid's Temple,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
at home, and I felt

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:84%
that it was so powerful that
eventually I would have to lead

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.390 align:middle line:84%
ceremonies there
to prepare people

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
into the energy of
the entire island.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I received my own
ceremony there,

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:90%
and I received my first wand.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I received my first
blessing by the druids.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I was a part of
this land at that moment.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.420 align:middle line:84%
When we arrived, we weren't
supposed to do a ceremony.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:84%
We were supposed to
have a free time.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And I would explain
some other things.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:84%
But as we got into
the temple, suddenly,

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I felt the energy like
you won't enter here

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:84%
without asking permission
and doing it properly.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So nobody was allowed to
get inside the temple just

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.620 align:middle line:90%
to take pictures and have fun.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:84%
It was like at the
door, I turned around,

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I saw everyone and
said, no way, I'm

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
going to let you go
in just like nothing.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I will
ask for permission.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:84%
So I entered to
ask for permission.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And as I touched the
altar, a butterfly

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.490 align:middle line:90%
came and laid down there.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to
her to ask permission

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
as the spirit of the
place to talk through her

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.410 align:middle line:90%
to the spirit of the place.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And as I got the
permission, I went out.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:90%
And the butterfly left.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I allowed the
people to come in.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But as we were moving around
and creating a circle,

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:84%
suddenly everything started
to become a ceremony.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And I went to ask for
permission to the druid that

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.010 align:middle line:84%
was in the cave on the
back, as I usually do.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Go ask permission.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:23.465 align:middle line:84%
And when I got there, I
immediately felt him take over.

00:13:23.465 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So I went back and
I wasn't me anymore,

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:90%
so I couldn't speak to anybody.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was already
tuned to their circle.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So he started to
balance everyone

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.590 align:middle line:90%
and to follow everything.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And just with the
sight, Guille and Karina

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:84%
knew what they needed
to do in that moment.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So without speaking, we
started to prepare the altar,

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:90%
to cleanse everybody.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:90%
And we haven't spoken.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Nobody said what to do.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:84%
We were just following the
energy of what was happening,

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:90%
and the people too.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:17.395 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:17.395 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So the whole ceremony was
about cleaning the lower

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.210 align:middle line:84%
part of the body,
because we were

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:84%
leaving the South
part of England going

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:90%
to the North of Great Britain.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So we were going
from the South plexus

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.390 align:middle line:84%
down where the emotions
and creations are in order

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:84%
to go up where the heart
and the mind is anchored.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So this was like a
ceremony to say this is

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.580 align:middle line:90%
the end of a part of the path.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And you can begin the new one.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:84%
But in order to do that, you
need to remember who you are.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:27.240 align:middle line:84%
[CHANTING] You are
a cause of hopes

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:90%
who once have walked this land.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The ego part of the masculine
side of the island is saying you

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.940 align:middle line:84%
need to remember who you really
are in order to keep going.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main things
that the druids said

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
was, there was a moment when
you were a child that someone

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:90%
told you stop playing.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:90%
You have responsibilities now.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Don't say this.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Now you have to take care.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
you stop playing

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.680 align:middle line:90%
and you forgot your name.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.110 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, you became who
others were willing for you

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.910 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Since that moment,
you lost magic.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Since that moment, you
lost your childhood.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:84%
[CHANTING] Take a deep breath
and rest sound your true name

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
to me who you are and
you have always been.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So everyone starts to
connect with that and crying,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and then singing
their names out loud.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Even if they had no idea what
they were actually saying,

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:90%
their spirit starts to speak.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And their names started
to be pronounced.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So this Druid, he
starts to grab things

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:84%
from all around to be
used in the ceremony.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:84%
He used stuff from
inside the cave,

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
from outside in
one of the altars.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So he was using different
things to connect

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.645 align:middle line:90%
different parts of the person.

00:17:20.645 --> 00:17:23.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So he used a pine
that he found out

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
there to connect the pineal
with the pines of the tree

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and the pines of the sun,
which is the inner light.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle line:84%
He used the light of the sun to
connect each one of the crown

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:48.220 align:middle line:84%
chakras and put them
all together in a net,

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and put it up in the
highest point of the stone

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that we were all
facing in the circle.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And as we did that, they
were all connecting that net.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So he went down on a stone and
grabbed a spider, a big spider,

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.800 align:middle line:90%
and put it in the stone.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And by singing, leading
her with the finger,

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:84%
he was leading her to
make a spiral going up

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:84%
until the spider
got up in the pine.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So when the spider got there,
he grabbed the light of the sun

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.070 align:middle line:90%
and made the last weaving.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.540 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's the end
of the ceremony,

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.790 align:middle line:90%
like the wrap of everything.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:84%
People in the ceremony started
to feel that connection.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
very powerful when

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:84%
you see the people start
using their own energy

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:90%
and handling their own energy.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And being aware by themselves,
where was the trauma?

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:90%
How to release it.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Finishing their own
process, releasing,

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:90%
and connecting and healing.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
powerful for me to see

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:84%
how people do this
process by themselves too,

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:84%
not only because
they are guided.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And to allow them
to do that part

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:52.410 align:middle line:84%
that they have come here to do
by their own, their own self.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So once we connected
with this plexus,

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.910 align:middle line:84%
with this center of
gravity that was weaved

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:84%
by the net in that
moment, we had

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:84%
to go up to the first step in
the upper part of the body,

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.580 align:middle line:90%
which is the heart--

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:90%
in Castlerigg.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Castlerigg represents the heart.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:84%
The heart is actually a machine
that pulses time and space.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.690 align:middle line:84%
If you could hear all the
hearts in the universe beating

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, you would
start to hear this machine.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I bring
people to that place

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:37.330 align:middle line:84%
it is to feel the power of that
machine of all hearts together.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:90%
