00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:23.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Our next step was
in the Lake District.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:84%
The region is
called Lake District

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:84%
because it's a mountain that
is surrounded by nine lakes.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And they are all pointing to
one small lake in the center.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
What we have here is the
Metatron's Cube in this region.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:84%
It's one lake
representing the dimension

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
of the center and the
other eight lakes around.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:10%
So that region there
represents the nine dimensions

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:10%
of the heart going towards
the center, to the void.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:84%
What we wanted to do
there was to connect

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.230 align:middle line:84%
with the machine of the heart
with the pulse of creation.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.450 align:middle line:84%
The main thing to understand
there is that the heart is not

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:84%
like we humans used to
think about the heart,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:90%
like the center of love.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:84%
The heart is actually a machine
that pulses time and space.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.650 align:middle line:90%
It's like a clock.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
If you could listen and hear
all the hearts in the universe

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:84%
beating at the same
time, you would

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
start to hear this
machine that makes

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:90%
time possible through gravity.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So every movement
creates a pulse

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
of energy, a pulse of gravity
that manifests a field of time.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was for
us to recognize that.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
As we connect with
the heart, we start

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.590 align:middle line:84%
to go to the center of
creation through time and space

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and find balance
so we can manifest

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:90%
our own time, our own space.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:84%
What I explained there to
people was that the Metatron's

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Cube related to this machine--

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:84%
works by four aspects of time
and four aspects of space.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So the four aspects of time
represents the four stages

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:84%
in which everything
in the universe

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
goes through, which is
expression, experimentation,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:90%
integration, and transcendence.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the base of
four of the directions

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:90%
of time in the Metatron's Cube.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And as humans, we have
four related to space,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.790 align:middle line:90%
which is projected into people.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:10%
So we have family.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:10%
We have friends.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:10%
We have lovers.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:10%
And we have challenges.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Usually, for the universe,
that would be directions,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:84%
like north, south, east,
west, up, down, right, left.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So these four directions
in our life are people.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:84%
In the Lake District, there is
one of the most beautiful stone

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.835 align:middle line:84%
circles, which is Castlerigg
that represents the heart.

00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
The first time that
I went to Castlerigg,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I sat in the chamber
that is in the center.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And I just allowed
myself to feel that beat

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.998 align:middle line:90%
throughout the cosmos.

00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:84%
I felt that I was in the
center of all things.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not usually a
person that talks

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:90%
about the heart or these things.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I usually, say, go
back to the heart

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
when I say the word
recuerda or remember.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:84%
But when I got
there, I understood

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:84%
that in order to connect with
the heart of the universe,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
we have to balance our
own hearts emotionally,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:90%
mentally, physically.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.256 align:middle line:84%
But it goes beyond the idea
that we have from the heart.

00:04:02.256 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:90%
[BAAING]

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I would
bring people there.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So I always feel that whenever
I bring people to that place

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
is to feel the power of that
machine of all the hearts

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.470 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:84%
When I come to each one
of the stone circles,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I usually, don't know
what we are going to do.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So I ask the energy of the
place or a master of the place,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.080 align:middle line:90%
if there is one.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:90%
So I went there.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just got inside
the circle, and then

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:84%
the tiny circle
inside the circle

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:84%
at the East side of Castlerigg,
and just opened myself

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:90%
to ask, what are we doing here?

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:90%
What is the task here?

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And I started to see the
pattern, like a mandala opening,

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:84%
like a beautiful
shape of squares.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And all the squares were
spinning and creating

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.190 align:middle line:90%
all of them like a tesseract.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So I could feel the
pulse of all of them.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And one eye staring
from the center--

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.650 align:middle line:90%
the fore.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I saw the whole region
with the nine legs

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:84%
creating this tesseract
going from inside, outside,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:90%
inside, outside.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:84%
That image, like a machine
of mandalas, going around,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:90%
that's how I understood.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:90%
We had 45 people.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I had to divide them in
nine groups of five people.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So what I invited
the people to do

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.455 align:middle line:84%
was to create nine groups
related to the nine lakes.

00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So each one of you is
located in the position

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:90%
of one of the lakes.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And, obviously, we have the
little lake in the center.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Between each one
of us, all of us,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
we are creating a
meta transcript.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And in your own
personal circle, you

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:84%
will create your
own meta transcript.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:84%
So we all created together
the Metatron's Cube.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:84%
We all created the
heart of the system.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And each one of these nine
circles of five people

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.805 align:middle line:84%
would represent someone staring
at one of the bases through time

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:29.605 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:84%
What we will do is to take this
four stages of our life related

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:90%
to four people in those stages.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
From your point to the left,
expression, experimentation,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:90%
integration, and transcendence.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing we will
do is go through a scanner

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:84%
into these people
and perceive where

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:84%
the energy of my body related
to that person is right now.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is,
for a few moments,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:84%
to perceive where I am
linked to that person.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And with my own
sounds and movement,

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I start to tune from their
hearts to your own heart.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Just feel and let yourself
move your own energy

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:84%
towards the heart and balance
the other energies to the heart.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So don't think much,
just let your soul move.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.760 align:middle line:84%
As we are doing this,
for our own process,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
we balance that with the
process of the entire system

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.045 align:middle line:84%
that we are using here,
which is the whole land.

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So have that in mind that
as you are balancing that,

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
you are balancing
the whole system.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:84%
The idea for that was
to balance the energy

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:84%
of the heart that, usually, is
spread around the entire body.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So to put all that
together into one center

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and raise it up to the heart of
that representative of family,

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
then the friends, then the
lovers, then the challenge,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:90%
with our own heart.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So rising up or lowering
down from the mind

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:84%
or from the body or lower
emotions towards the heart.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:28.235 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to put all
the center, the nine dimensions

00:08:28.235 --> 00:08:29.035 align:middle line:90%
into the core.

00:08:29.035 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.594 align:middle line:90%
Concentrate in your breathings.

00:08:37.594 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I become aware
that I find myself

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.960 align:middle line:90%
in the circle of the heart.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I reach for my own energy of
the heart spread along my body,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:84%
and the energy of
my heart spread

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:84%
throughout the body of
these other people connected

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.655 align:middle line:90%
to all the hearts of the world.

00:09:09.655 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And within my heart, connected
to the heart of the universe,

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I become aware of the
great cube of the creator

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:84%
throughout the time, expression,
experimentation, integration,

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.816 align:middle line:90%
and transcendence.

00:09:40.816 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
I take a deep breath
and visualize around me

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:84%
these four people that reflect
my own Metatron's Cube.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:10:00.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.605 align:middle line:84%
I become aware of
the square of time.

00:10:03.605 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:15.155 align:middle line:84%
I take a deep breath and expand
to the square of the space.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So as we did that with
our own tiny circle,

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
our own Metatron's Cube with
people that we relate to,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and the other ones were
just embodying that--

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.536 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:10:32.536 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:84%
--we started to create the pulse
to the center from each one

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.110 align:middle line:90%
of our hearts to one.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we created
the nine lakes.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And from the nine
lakes, we turn around.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And we went to the center
to create the center lake.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So we manifested the geometry
of the entire region,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:84%
feeling the beat
of the Earth there,

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:84%
connecting all the
hearts to only one.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Feel the brightness
of your heart chakra.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Smile and connect all
the hearts as a circle.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And you project your
hearts towards the center,

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:43.563 align:middle line:84%
creating only one in the
core of your own circle.

00:11:43.563 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And with your singing, make this
heart become bigger and bigger.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
We started to sing a song
that a friend of mine

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:84%
channeled singing
when we were doing

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:07.350 align:middle line:84%
the activations in
Argentina, which was Conecta.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.732 align:middle line:84%
It's a calling of
connect, connect, connect.

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:12.636 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) Conecta.

00:12:12.636 --> 00:12:21.113 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.113 --> 00:12:21.913 align:middle line:90%
Conecta.

00:12:21.913 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So the song says, connect
with the beat of her heart,

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:90%
which is Earth.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Connect with a beat of your own
heart to the heart of Earth.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Move your body.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Mueve tu cuerpo.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Bring all the hearts
to the center.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:90%
One circle.

Conecta.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:90%

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:39.261 align:middle line:90%

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Conecta.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Conecta.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we completed
the system of the Metatron's

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.055 align:middle line:90%
Cube, the time machine.

00:14:18.055 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I feel that for people, the
connection with the heart

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:84%
is not only the love level,
but mind and physical level,

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:84%
helps them to expand much
more the idea that we

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:84%
have of the center of
everything, of the heartbeat,

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.700 align:middle line:84%
of the system, of what love
means more than just an emotion

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:90%
related to humans.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
when they connect

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.500 align:middle line:84%
with all these perspectives
and expansions into all

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions of the heartbeat,
they feel expanded everywhere,

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:84%
because, sometimes, during a
tough process that people are

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:84%
living, they might feel, I don't
feel the love or I don't feel--

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:90%
now, I feel sad.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So when they understand
that every emotion is

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:84%
a pulse of the heart, and
it's part of the heartbeat,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:84%
it's not that you have to be in
love with something or someone

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:90%
in order to feel the system.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's releasing.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.970 align:middle line:84%
It's happiness also to
feel that it doesn't

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:90%
matter from where you feel it.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.770 align:middle line:90%
The heartbeat is there.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
The pulse that creates
time and space is there.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.090 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Usually, we relate the
heart, the high heart chakra

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:90%
with the feeling of the soul.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:90%
But the soul is energy.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest pulses of energy
are not just in the heart.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:84%
They are the connection between
our spine and our brain.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why the entrance
of the soul in the body

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.150 align:middle line:84%
is the atlas, which
is the last vertebrae.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:90%
That's why we went to Edinburgh.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:84%
That represents the
entrance of the soul.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.960 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:10%
Very close to the city,
actually, inside the city,

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:10%
there is a park with a
mountain called Arthur's Seat.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have been talking about
the King Arthur and the Sword

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Excalibur and everything
since Glastonbury.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that place
represents the place where

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
you sit on the throne, where you
recognize your own power, which

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
is the moment where the
spirit and the soul, like,

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
the king and the queen,
they sit on the throne.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And that seat, that throne
is inside the brain.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So all the spiritual
level, all the mind,

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
the connection with
the entire universe,

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:84%
they all settle in the
throne, which is the atlas.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the point where
all the information

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.460 align:middle line:84%
comes from all the body,
from all the senses,

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:90%
and connects with the divine.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
point of connection.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to share
that place with them.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:84%
When I went for the first
time to Arthur's Seat,

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I climbed there and I just
sat to meditate and see.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that place,
Edinburgh, Arthur's Seat,

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:90%
represents freedom.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.025 align:middle line:90%
I feel free when I'm there.

00:17:36.025 --> 00:17:36.825 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES]

00:17:36.825 --> 00:17:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Like a release.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So some of the moments that
I felt trapped in my life,

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and I was close by like,
Barcelona or something

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:84%
like this, I just took
a flight for one day

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:54.360 align:middle line:84%
to come climb the mountain,
sit there, and went back.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So being there helped
me to say, I am free.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And that was the spirit
that I got from those times.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time that
I climbed a mountain thinking

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.085 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to weave that energy.

00:18:10.085 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a tough path going up.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I don't want
to push anybody to do it,

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:90%
if they cannot.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So I just said, I will
just explain what it means.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And the explanation of
that was how mind and heart

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
are these two pulses of
information from the soul, which

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:84%
is the queen and the spirit,
the mind, which is the king.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Both together are connected
through the courts.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
The resonance of the voice
in the throat chakra.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And these voices are weaving
the geometry in order

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.730 align:middle line:84%
to create Metatron's
Cube, the throne beyond.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.920 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So my idea for that was, let's
walk up and create the throne.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And every step, trying
to form and think

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and meditate about all the
paths that we have done,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:90%
but it started to rain so hard.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.565 align:middle line:84%
It was so difficult to
even stare at the mountain.

00:19:16.565 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, the rain stopped.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And some of us
started to walk up.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And, eventually, everyone
said, I will go up.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And even the people that
couldn't walk much, they said,

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.125 align:middle line:90%
I will try a little bit.

00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:35.730 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.540 align:middle line:84%
As we were going
up, I felt that I

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:84%
needed to do my own path to
make every step with awareness.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I won't lead, I
won't go up and find the place

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and try to explain
the situation.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has to
do their own path.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:90%
And I have to do the same.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So I was going slowly,
singing to my history,

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
trying to think about
everything that I did

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.025 align:middle line:84%
and weaving that
as I was walking.

00:20:10.025 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.520 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was much
more about enjoying

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.385 align:middle line:90%
the path than leading the path.

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I saw that the
oldest people in the group

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:90%
were coming right behind me.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to be
also there close by

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.990 align:middle line:90%
to encourage them to keep going.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Eventually, we all went there.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.950 align:middle line:90%
We all went up.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And just by the
happiness of arriving,

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:84%
they started to sing naturally
and creating and weaving

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:90%
all this pattern.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:90%
We started to create the throne.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:84%
We created this powerful moment
of weaving with our singing

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.170 align:middle line:84%
all the strings of
this instrument that we

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.900 align:middle line:84%
are connecting heart and
mind through the voice.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I enjoy it a lot
because I didn't do anything.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:90%
I was just enjoying my own path.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:28.425 align:middle line:84%
And everyone just joined
the joy of that moment.

00:21:28.425 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:90%


00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.490 align:middle line:84%
After we entered the soul,
and we saw the queen,

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:90%
we went for the king.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's the eye of God.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:84%
The inner eye that
sees everything.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:90%
That's Loch Ness.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:57.580 align:middle line:84%
That lake is like an
eye that sees beyond.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Clava Cairns is like a portal
from this reality transcending

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:90%
to another dimension.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I felt the frequency of
the eighth dimension.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a very crazy place where
you stop being yourself.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the weaver, the
toroid, this weird spider

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't have a body.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:84%
People started to feel that they
were going farther and farther

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:84%
to the center of something
that they couldn't relate to.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:34.000 align:middle line:90%
