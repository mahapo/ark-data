00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>> After, in the stone circles,
I came back to Bolivia to Lake

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Titicaca with a few friends.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:10%
And I start to feel the
presence of Thoth, of Djehuty.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:10%
And I had no idea why because it
was not Egypt, but his presence

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:10%
there was really heavy.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:10%
And there was a
message of meeting him

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:10%
in a place called
Aramu Muru, which

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:10%
is a door in the
rock in Peru, just

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:10%
in the border with Bolivia.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.430 align:middle line:10%
And so we went there, and
when we just arrived there,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:10%
suddenly, I became him.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was weird for my
friends because they never

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:90%
saw me that way.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I just
turned back to them.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:90%
And my face was different.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:90%
And they said, what happened?

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- I did like
this, and two birds,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Ibis, the Thoth birds,
flew from me from behind.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was like,
what is happening?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Something weird was happening.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:84%
He guided us to a whole
path around the mountain

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:84%
to prove who would
be accompanying me

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:90%
to this process.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So he was testing
us all the time.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.570 align:middle line:84%
After all that, he
says to me, there

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
is a mistake in your
calculations regarding

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:84%
where you have to go
and what you have to do.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
He told me there are two ways
to understand what we are doing.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
One is geologically, and the
other one is magnetically.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So you have a geological North
Pole and a magnetical North

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Pole.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Thoth told me, you have to
follow the geological one,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
but you will activate
that in the moment

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:90%
when the North Pole changes.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, in a few
years, the North Pole

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:84%
will change its position
from the West to the East.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So when that happens, it will
be two years, 2020 and 2021,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:84%
that the North Pole will be
aligned with the physical North

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Pole.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment, both
networks will be aligned,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and that's the moment to do
a reconnection for what's

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.870 align:middle line:90%
going to come next.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's the moment when
everything should be done,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.910 align:middle line:90%
and you have until March 2022.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it was like, OK, and
after that, we cannot do it.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they
said, OK, the next step

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:84%
is to prepare yourself
for that trip.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.910 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So in 2018, I started to
coordinate this huge trip

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
getting ready for 2020,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:90%
but everything was wrong.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, no, no, no.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:90%
So I had to wait.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:90%
I had to expect--

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.290 align:middle line:90%
and I had no idea what.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And they said the
grid is not complete

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:84%
because you need the people
that connects the grid.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was the moment when I
started to come here, to Gaia,

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and film the first
season of "Initiation."

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:10%
My name is Matias de Stefano.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:90%
And my purpose is to remember.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:84%
When I came and I
started to film this,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I had no clue what it
was about because I

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:84%
thought that it was just
come and film some videos,

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:90%
And I would leave.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.640 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, that
meant that a lot

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
of people from all
over the world,

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:84%
mostly in English, started
to follow what I was doing.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of people
working with this got bigger,

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and people started helping
me to keep going, to do it.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I had no clue that it
was a part of that spread

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.690 align:middle line:84%
of the network of the
people that we needed

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish the mission.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:84%
In that time when I was filming
and organized everything

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.790 align:middle line:84%
for the trip, my mom
said, this year, 2018,

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be seven years
from our first 11-11 gathering,

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:90%
2011.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And we started thinking about it
and taking all the things out.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we thought
maybe we have to do it again.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't know.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's ask.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:90%
So I went to Capilla de Monte.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And I traveled there and went
to the mountains for a meeting.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it's
been a septennial.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yes,
it's the perfect timing

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:84%
to do this because,
after, you will

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.420 align:middle line:84%
have to take the energy that
we are going to work here

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
so you could go to your trip and
do what you are supposed to do.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So we started to
organize everything

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:90%
for this new gathering.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And people were really
excited because it's been

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:90%
seven years without doing that.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
magical, the first one.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So, November 2018, it
was a perfect meeting

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:90%
of almost 4,000 people.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:84%
All the people that came were
acknowledged of the task.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
It was not like, what
we are doing here?

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:84%
It was specifically to
connect time, past, present,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:84%
and future, doing three
activations and meditations.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And in each one of them,
one of the Americas

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.490 align:middle line:90%
had to open the doors.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:10%
So the grandmothers of these
native cultures of the three

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.540 align:middle line:10%
Americas were there
to do the opening,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:10%
and it was very beautiful
because they were accompanied

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.210 align:middle line:10%
by a woman representing the
shamans of that territory,

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:10%
of the Capilla de Monte.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So the four of them were
opening the doors for everyone

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
to do the ceremonies, and I
was channeling during each one

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:90%
of the meditations.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me their
all the information

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:84%
of what was going to
come and all the energy

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:90%
for the next stage of the I Am.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So after Capilla
de Monte, 11-11,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I came back here to
the States to film

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:90%
with Gaia for new seasons.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:84%
In these new seasons,
I was supposed

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
to talk about my memories
in Egypt, in Khem.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.900 align:middle line:84%
But I had all these
things in my head

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, the mission, the
connection, everything,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, when I was
talking about all this,

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I was describing how the Sirian
people came to this planet.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I started to
wonder why I remember them,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and I started to wonder
why I am doing this,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.090 align:middle line:84%
why I know what is going
to happen, why are they

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:51.620 align:middle line:84%
telling me what to do and
not all the others around me.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So I was starting to
see everything around me

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:84%
like if I was there,
like if I was walking

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:84%
with them in the same
halls, and I start

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:84%
to see how they
were in front of me,

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.950 align:middle line:90%
all covered with these veils.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And we were not supposed to
look to them, into their eyes.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, when I
was explaining this

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
in the camera of how
everything looked like

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and how everything
was, I remembered

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.750 align:middle line:84%
that we were all like this,
bowing in front of them

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:90%
as they were talking.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:90%
And I looked.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:36.299 align:middle line:84%
I looked up, and I stared
into the eyes of one of them.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was like the memory--

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I just knew.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
I remembered that
moment that the reason

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:84%
why I remembered
now everything is

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:90%
because I saw it in his eyes.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So it was like
suddenly knowing why

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:84%
I had to prepare
myself to do all this.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:84%
It was because I did a mistake
of staring into its eyes

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
while they were talking
about the future.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Realizing that was
somehow blaming myself

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.470 align:middle line:84%
for everything that I
was doing, and everything

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that I have done,
and everything that I

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:84%
am doing like not being in
a normal life, not being

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:90%
able to do something simple.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I started to just say I
shouldn't have seen this.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:84%
I was not supposed to
look into the eyes.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:90%
So I broke in that moment.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And when I was just explaining
about the environment,

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:90%
I realized about this.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
I just fell down,
crying in the studio

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:90%
and not knowing what to do.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.910 align:middle line:84%
It was a weird
thing that happened,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't come
back to me for a while

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
until I could process
and accept that it

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
was because I saw into their
eyes that I am doing all this,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:90%
that I remember the future.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:10.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
In 2018, I received the
message of everything changing.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And they said, this
was because there

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:84%
was a portal, a very
important portal, that

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:90%
would take two years to close.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And we had to take
a benefit from it.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:84%
That was the portal
of time and space.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.950 align:middle line:10%
They said, look
into the numbers,

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.730 align:middle line:10%
and you will find out
which are the dates.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So the key was the number 2,
time and space, two things.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:90%
So I said, 2020, 2020.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:90%
So February 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2020.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:56.270 align:middle line:84%
2, 2, 2, it's 8, so
it's the infinite time.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So the portal of time
would start that day.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And the last day of the portal
would be 12, which is space.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Which number would give me 12?

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:90%
That would be February 22, 2022.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:10%
So in between the 8
space and 12 time,

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.530 align:middle line:10%
you will have the great portal
2020, 2021 from February

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.710 align:middle line:10%
to February 2022.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So in that time, I was
supposed to do the whole test,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.940 align:middle line:84%
connect the network, inform
everyone what is the I Am,

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and reach every
spot in the planet.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And they said--
and also you have

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:84%
to do it while the entire
planet stops and meditates.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And everyone must think
about the crown of the planet

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:84%
because the crown of the
planet, North Pole, is changing,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
so everyone has to
have, in their mind,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:90%
the crown of the planet.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So one of my guides
told me you're not

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.250 align:middle line:84%
going to do this
alone, but you have

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
to remember that you are
not part of the circle.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:90%
You are the center.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:10%
You have to pick 12
persons that will

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:10%
help you to do the
activation around the world.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:84%
This was late 2019, and
I did the list of people.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
One of them was my
husband 12,000 years ago

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:90%
who is a friend of mine now.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the persons
that 12,000 years ago

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:90%
in front of the things--

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.560 align:middle line:90%
that was my first memory--

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.180 align:middle line:84%
told me, whenever it's needed
and the moment it arrives,

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:90%
I will be here with you.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter which time.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter our bodies.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:10%
So I wrote to him, and he
said, of course, he will go.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So 12,000 years after
in front of the things,

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
he was there with
me beginning this,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:84%
so it was a perfect
cycle of 12,000

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.630 align:middle line:90%
years of working with someone.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So I choose some of
the closest friends

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:84%
that I would trust that
we could do the work with,

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and I took them all to Egypt
for the portal of time.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And we, all together,
did this activation

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:84%
with 144 people that
came also for us,

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and we went all to the Great
Pyramid and this activation

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to open this portal of time and
to allow us to do everything

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:90%
that we had to do.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And during this
activation in February

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.595 align:middle line:84%
is when they told us
that the world will stop.

00:13:38.595 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So I was supposed to go to
France for one or two months

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:84%
to learn French because, in
one of the nodes that I was

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:84%
supposed to go, Ile
Amsterdam in the Indian Ocean

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
in the Austral
territories of France,

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:84%
they only accept you
if you speak French

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:84%
because the whole crew of
the boats only speak French.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you
have to know French.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:10%
So I said, OK that's one of
the nodes, so I have to go.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:90%
So I will go and learn French.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So when I arrived to
Nancy where I was staying,

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:84%
my guides told me, so
now, sit down, and wait

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
four or five months until
the next signal to come.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but I have to
start traveling because it's

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:84%
impossible in six months
to do the whole trip;

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:90%
I need at least one year.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.100 align:middle line:84%
If I don't start now,
how am I going to do it?

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And he said,
everything is changing.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Now the planet will meditate,
so it will be easier

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.685 align:middle line:90%
to get to those spots.

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is to
take care of that everyone

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:90%
understand what is the I Am.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I was a little bit
frustrated because I

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:84%
had been since 2015
organizing this trip,

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and they just said a few
moments before, no, it's

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:90%
not going to be done that way.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, OK.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:90%
So I said, why all this?

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And they said, to
learn, to learn stuff,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:90%
so you learn many things.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Now you know French,
congratulations.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:90%
So, all these kind of things.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's when we started
to film another season

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:84%
of "Initiation" in France,
and we started to film also

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:84%
these stories that
happened to me.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was funny because I
was telling all these stories,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and I remember that I said,
I can't tell these stories.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel the
emotion to tell them.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:90%
I feel lost.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I was frustrated because
my trip was wrong

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
bad and I don't know.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said I don't know
if this makes any sense

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.070 align:middle line:90%
to film all this.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So I went to take a breath
outside, and suddenly,

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
in the wall, there was the
symbol that I always do,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:01.850 align:middle line:90%
which is this.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.060 align:middle line:10%
It's an old, ancient
symbol of alignment

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:10%
with the spirit and the soul.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:10%
And it was like a
dove in the wall

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:10%
with a symbol with the hand,
and I said, you know what?

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's all fine.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:90%
I will keep filming.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:10%
I will keep doing this because
the signal was so clear.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So I came back to
Nancy for these three

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.660 align:middle line:84%
months of quarantine, but I
couldn't hear any of my guides.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.952 align:middle line:90%
I was asking, what should I do?

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:34.752 align:middle line:90%
What should I do?

00:16:34.752 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:90%
What should I do?

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:90%
And, nothing, nothing, nothing.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.850 align:middle line:84%
It was silence, silence,
silence, totally silent.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So I was really
concerned on what to do.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And this day that I wasn't
expecting for anything,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.570 align:middle line:90%
I went to the bathroom to pee.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And while I was peeing,
I just feel someone here

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
behind that said, now we
have to talk about it.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, why now?

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Why now?

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Let me just wash
my hands at least.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
He's like-- I don't know
why they choose this moment.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they don't understand
that the body has some needs.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So they said, now this is
the moment to speak about it.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.730 align:middle line:90%
We have to do this and this.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And so while I was in
the bathroom trying

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
to clean my hands, he
was explaining to me

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:90%
about how the I Am would be.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So I explain all this
in YouTube while I was

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:90%
ironing the sheets of the bed.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Everything was so weird.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:10%
So they told me to do that.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Be normal.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So I was just explaining all
these while I was ironing,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.980 align:middle line:90%
and everyone was--

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if everyone got
it, but the message was there.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:90%
So in this process of not--

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I understood to clarify
things; to make it more simple.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:10%
Everyone got it when they
saw me ironing and explaining

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:10%
that I was peeing, and my guide
told me about what is the I Am.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So they said, now you're
ready to go to the place

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.800 align:middle line:84%
where represents everywhere
in the world, which

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:90%
is the Great Pyramid of Egypt.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go there, and
you shouldn't move from there

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:23.270 align:middle line:90%
for 365 days.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment that the
borders were open again

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.530 align:middle line:90%
in France, I went to Egypt.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until I went for
the first time in the pyramid

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that the masters
came and told me,

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:90%
and the path will be 12 months.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And you have to go every
day inside the pyramid,

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.790 align:middle line:84%
connect with one node,
and bring the information

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:84%
to the people of what is the
I Am, according to that node.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And once you complete
the whole process of 12,

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.800 align:middle line:84%
which is the initiatic path of
the I Am starting in August,

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.470 align:middle line:84%
exactly the moment
when the star of Sirius

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:90%
appears in the horizon.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was the same
day of my birthday

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:90%
because it always changes.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But that day, I
understood why the I Am

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.190 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be
downloaded through me in 2015

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:90%
during my birthday in Egypt.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:10%
That day, I
understood, oh, this is

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:10%
why because the first day of
the year in 2020 was August 4,

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.192 align:middle line:10%
which is my birthday.

00:19:23.192 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:90%
And it was not because of me.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:84%
It's because of
the star of Sirius

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:84%
appearing that day
in the morning,

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:84%
which, for the Atlanteans,
was the beginning of the year.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.420 align:middle line:90%
So we started that day.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Every day, I started to do a
meditation inside the pyramid,

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.370 align:middle line:84%
download the information
of a specific code.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:90%
I went back.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I created a blog where I
was supposed to write down

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:90%
all the information.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about it in a
conversation between I

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:90%
and am, which is my higher self.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:20:00.190 align:middle line:10%
So all the conversation was, I,
asking something, am answering,

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.210 align:middle line:10%
and all the process
was to show people

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:10%
about my process of
understanding all this.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And every night, I would do the
transmission to explain this.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And because of Gaia, I had
to do it in English, too.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.110 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:90%
Hi, everyone.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Good morning.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Good evening.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Good night.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:10%
I started translating myself
every sentence in Spanish

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:10%
and English, so it was
heavy for many people.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.380 align:middle line:10%
But for me, it was
really helpful.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:10%
So people could get it faster
because I had no idea what

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:10%
was going on every day.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:10%
Every day was different.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:10%
I have no clue.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:49.780 align:middle line:10%
At least 4,000 people joined
me every day livestreaming,

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:56.320 align:middle line:10%
and at least 12,000 or 13,000
daily were watching the video.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.590 align:middle line:10%
So it was a whole
year of connection

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:04.060 align:middle line:10%
with at least 12,000
people day by day

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:10%
in which we were aligning,
meditating about every concept

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:10%
that makes up the I Am.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So the whole process of
12 months was perfect,

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and seven years after, we begin
with the I Am, August 8, 2015.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It repeated the same
in August 8, 2021.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:10%
That day, we got into the
pyramid with many people,

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:10%
and a huge frequency
opened that, from my mouth,

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.360 align:middle line:10%
came sounds that I cannot do.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:49.690 align:middle line:10%
And the presence introduced
himself as Metatron.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:56.860 align:middle line:10%
And we could feel every
archangel and our a of angels

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:10%
around.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:03.550 align:middle line:10%
And everything got so
incredible that expanded

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.560 align:middle line:10%
throughout all the network.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And they showed me every
one of the 12 faces

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
of the planet as we were
there, anchoring in our bodies,

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
being held by
thousands of people

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
around the world
meditating that day.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And then each one of us
would come all together

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:84%
to do the same in
Egypt in February 2022,

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.220 align:middle line:84%
again, with all the
people present there.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And once it finished,
they said, now

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.280 align:middle line:84%
you are ready to
face the dragon.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And dragon won't be this trip
that you expect for it to be.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:84%
He will be the
connection with yourself,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.450 align:middle line:84%
with the power that
you have within,

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.792 align:middle line:84%
and face it to see if
you are able to do that.

00:22:50.792 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:10%
What happened there in
that moment; that pyramid,

00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:10%
was like a revelation of things
that will come in 2024, 2026,

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:10%
all related to the download
of that information coming,

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:10%
and it was so
beautiful, and perfect,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:10%
and balancing, that moment,
that I understood the last seven

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:10%
years, and everything
that happened,

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:10%
and how perfectly aligned
was every day and everything.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:84%
It was like that
day, acknowledging

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:84%
that 2022, for me, will
be like the last exam

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:36.170 align:middle line:90%
after 12,000 years of work.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:10%
When I started to connect
all the energy that

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.195 align:middle line:10%
was needed for the portal--

00:23:41.195 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:10%
--I was already connecting
with one of those beings

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:10%
that I saw in my dream
in another world.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:55.000 align:middle line:90%
