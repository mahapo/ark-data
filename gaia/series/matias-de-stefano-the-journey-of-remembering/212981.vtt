00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.970 align:middle line:10%
>> 2023 this year for me is like
a middle point or a transition

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:10%
point to something that
I have to do in 2024.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:84%
This year, I'm
recreating everything,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
downloading the information
of what the next task--

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
everything that I am
supposed to create

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:90%
to do for the next 30 years.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm receiving all
that very separate

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
so I can put it
together eventually.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's
so difficult for me

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.038 align:middle line:84%
lately to explain to
people what I'm receiving.

00:00:54.038 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:84%
That was something
that I was worried

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.210 align:middle line:84%
about because I felt what would
happen now that I finished this?

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Would I remember more?

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Would I connect?

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
How is this, like, I'm going
to be more human than ever?

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be reconnected to
something in a different level.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.720 align:middle line:84%
I was worried about
it a little bit,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.710 align:middle line:84%
but the feeling was I
need to create everything

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:84%
During this process
of acknowledging

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I have to release
everything from the past

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
give away many of the things
that have been attached

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.870 align:middle line:84%
to me from an old structure
when I realized about all that

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and I said, I'm going
to release all this,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:90%
suddenly my body reacted.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:90%
And I ended up in the hospital.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:90%
I had appendicitis.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So I had to take the all
grounding, all structures

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:90%
from me.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And after I did that,
I felt released somehow

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
physically from something that
was holding me for a long time.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:10%
And that took me to
project into create things

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:10%
that people were asking me for,
not that my guides or my higher

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:10%
self were saying, but
that people were asking,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:10%
we would love for you to do this
trip again or to take us there

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:10%
or to create this.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:10%
So I started to put
together all these ideas.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:10%
Organizing these trips in
different places in the world

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:10%
was much more about
allowing people

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:10%
to live the experience
of going to power places

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:10%
and to take the same path that
I took once in order for them

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:10%
to live that and to relate
and learn about what

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:10%
an initiatic path is.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime, I was
like a little bit concerned

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out if I would
be open to a new information

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:84%
again, to something different,
a new mission because everything

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:90%
was like very quiet.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, what
started to happen

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.110 align:middle line:84%
was I was finding the link in
all the mythology traditions

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:90%
talking about the same story.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And they are not talking
about gods or goddesses.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.920 align:middle line:84%
They are talking about
a natural process

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
that happened to the planet
millions of years ago

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and that it's an echo
that we are living today.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:10%
As I have been traveling
around the world,

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:10%
I noticed that every
culture has a tree of life,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.665 align:middle line:10%
and its description fits the
magnetic field of the planet.

00:03:44.665 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:84%
The energy within this field
flows through the poles

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and can be seen in the
shape of the apple.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic axis is represented
by a sword Excalibur.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:84%
The brightest star in the
northern sky Arcturus also known

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:90%
in Greek as Arcus--

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:84%
the white bear--
guides the planet

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.060 align:middle line:84%
through the precession
of the equinoxes

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:84%
sharing its energy with the 12
constellations of our Zodiac.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:10%
Those 12 are known through
history as knights or apostles.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:10%
The energy from
the constellations

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:10%
fuels the kundalini
of the planet

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.570 align:middle line:10%
as it snakes along
the mountain ranges.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
When the sword
changes its position,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.375 align:middle line:84%
this movement can release a
poison into the snaking energy.

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:84%
The goal of humans is to create
a balance within themselves

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:84%
so that they can be in
harmony with the magnetism

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
This harmony can help transform
any poison into medicine.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:10%
The Greek word Metatron refers
to metathronos or "throne

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:10%
beyond."

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Metatron's cube is
a structure that

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
encodes every pattern
in the universe

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and is known as the seed, the
flower, fruit, and tree of life.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.230 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly it was all a story
about many, many different

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
traditions related to the
Norse tradition, Middle East

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:84%
tradition, Egyptian tradition,
all the trees of life together.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.690 align:middle line:10%
It was so much information
that I couldn't understand it

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.905 align:middle line:10%
because it was too much, a lot
of things happening together.

00:05:34.905 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:84%
It was very difficult
for me to understand

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:90%
exactly what I needed to do.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:10%
So I just did normal
things that my new reality

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:10%
was asking from me, like making
podcasts, interviews, organizing

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:10%
trips.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.820 align:middle line:10%
And in between those
podcasts and those meetings,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:10%
I was invited to a
retreat in Costa Rica.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I started a week of 4 ayahuasca
ceremonies, consecutive,

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.170 align:middle line:90%
which I've never done.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it was like
opening the door to myself

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:90%
into a new reality.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
It was like entering to
everything that I was

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:90%
supposed to do in the future.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So I started to see all
the signs and the patterns

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.930 align:middle line:84%
of everything around me and the
next steps that I have to take.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So I suddenly opened
into a reality

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
that gave me so much
information about so many tasks

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and so many things that I had
to do that it was incredible.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And every day, it was
deeper and deeper.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I only knew like three people
in the ceremony or four people.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
The rest, I had no
idea who they were.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:10%
And one of them that I had no
idea who he was in the ayahuasca

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:10%
ceremony, they started to
talk to me about things

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.140 align:middle line:10%
that he specifically
needed to do.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was he
needs to go to Egypt

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:90%
to open a door for you.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So after the ceremony,
I went to him and said,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:90%
"You have to go to Egypt."

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "I'm
going next week."

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:10%
And I said, "Well, you have
to do this and this and this."

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "We are
going to do that."

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:10%
And I said, "Perfect.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:90%
So the system works."

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And we started to laugh
about that system works.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:10%
And when I started to
explain the task, he said,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.275 align:middle line:10%
"That's too complicated for
me, maybe you should come."

00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:36.770 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.890 align:middle line:90%
So I ended up in Egypt.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And in that trip, I
met all the people

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that I saw in the
ayahuasca ceremony.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:84%
I explained to those people,
"Look, I know many of you

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:84%
are inside of my
projects in the future.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you think you have
something to tell me, I'm here."

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So basically inside
that trip, I started

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect with people
that I had no idea about

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and that were keys to my
task in the next years.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:84%
That started to open
a whole story related

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.890 align:middle line:84%
to a breaking system in
the origin of creation

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
mainly related to the
history of this planet Earth.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:10%
It took me back to
that first story

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.980 align:middle line:10%
of Bir Tawil, the territory in
South Egypt, the land of no one.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:10%
Something was telling me that
specific territory is related

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:10%
to the philosopher's stone, and
it's the missing piece in order

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:10%
to complete the whole
parcel of the planet

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:10%
to rebalance and reset the
initiatic path that Thoth

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:10%
had designed for everyone.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.730 align:middle line:10%
The project was we need
to reset that stone.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:10%
I was sharing this,
and something before

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.740 align:middle line:10%
was so crazy everyone started
to say yes, there is something

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So you keep the
track and let us know

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
what is happening, what is
the information hidden there.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So I started to be open
for the universe to give me

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.995 align:middle line:90%
the tools and the clues.

00:09:15.995 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Following the signs, I
ended up in a meeting

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:90%
where I met with Robert Grant.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't supposed
to sit with him,

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:84%
but we started to talk
about what are we doing here

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:84%
in this place, why are we
talking here and now about all

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:90%
these concepts.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.337 align:middle line:84%
And I started to tell him
about the story of Bir Tawil.

00:09:41.337 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And he told me about
something that he

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.300 align:middle line:84%
discovered about Egypt related
to the philosopher's stone.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I was like, that's
what I'm looking for.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So he showed me the geometry
of this philosopher's stone.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Wait a moment."

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:10%
And I got a map of Bir Tawil.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:10%
And the pattern of the
geometry is exactly

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.820 align:middle line:10%
the limits of that territory.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:10%
It's so perfectly aligned
how the philosopher's

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:10%
stone, the long pyramid that
holds every pyramid inside

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.980 align:middle line:10%
is actually the
limits of Bir Tawil.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:10%
And it's called the
triangle of Bir Tawil.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:84%
There is some energy
from other levels

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.110 align:middle line:84%
that have been stuck
in that land that

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:84%
opened a lot of information
related to a portal

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
through time to heal the very
first wound in the system

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:84%
of Earth, which is
the broken heart.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And the broken heart means when
a stone collapsed to the planet

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:90%
and broke the magnetic field.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like a
heart was broken.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And the toroid, the magnetic
field was collapsed in half.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the image of
the Apple that we have,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:84%
like how the apple, the
tree of life, the apple tree

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is a symbolism of all
sins and conflicts

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have related
to that moment of void

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that the magnetic field
lived when it was collapsed.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.860 align:middle line:10%
And it all takes us to the North
of Sudan, the South of Egypt,

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:10%
like, if something
happened there

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:10%
at the very beginning of
the creation of the planet.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why everything
started there,

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and everything takes us
back to that territory.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:10%
So when we were talking about
that he shows me a design

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:10%
that he was doing, which
was Excalibur on the Nile.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:10%
And I was like, wait a moment.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.260 align:middle line:84%
That's something that I've been
told in England a long time

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:90%
ago to find that.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So all the different
pieces started

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:84%
to take me to connect these
people, these different people

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.855 align:middle line:84%
that will help you to open the
door of the philosopher's stone.

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:08.620 align:middle line:10%
Following another sign, I went
to Malta with a few friends, Blu

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:10%
and Reggie.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.283 align:middle line:84%
We started to see the
energy of the island related

00:12:13.283 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to the philosopher's
stone and all information

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:90%
that I had to receive.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.440 align:middle line:84%
When I accessed the
information of Malta,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:84%
the data was the beehive, the
beehive of the entire planet,

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:84%
which is the magnetic
field that was broken.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And the only ones that
can repair that system

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:84%
are feminine energies that
sing, so the bees of the planet.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:84%
There is a lineage of
royalty related to the bees.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's women that sing
specific songs to hold

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field
to be repaired.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's been thousands of
years without those songs being

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:90%
sung all around the planet.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:10%
So the whole story
was telling me

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:10%
about we need to put a
lot of feminine energy

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:10%
together to sing the same song
and to harvest the honey that

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:10%
would create the gods on Earth.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:90%
So why this story?

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Why to repair the system we
need to create this honey

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:90%
from the specific frequency?

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So that took me to the
story of the elixir drinks

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
that the gods of the
Olympus used to drink

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:90%
which was honey with water.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So this honey was the first
one that was harvest in Malta.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Malta means honey actually.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So the first honey was called
by the sailors in Greece.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:45.500 align:middle line:10%
And the reason is because after
the glaciation when Europe

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:10%
was covered in ice,
when the Ice Age ended,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.910 align:middle line:10%
all the flowers that
were growing in Europe

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:10%
had the information of the ice,
the information that had been

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:10%
stored for thousands of years.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So the only ones that could
take the information out

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle line:90%
from the flowers were the bees.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So the bees from
Malta in South Europe

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that took the
information, grab it from there,

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and created the gods elixir so
the people could became gods

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
by getting the
information inside

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.410 align:middle line:84%
through the singing of
women singing to the hives

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and activating that
information in order

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.530 align:middle line:84%
to repair the broken heart
of the very beginning, which

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:84%
is the first scene of the tree
of life, the rotten apple.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:10%
And the rotten Apple is that
breaking part of the system

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.550 align:middle line:10%
that I had no idea what it was.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:84%
After all that, I had to go to
Canary Islands for another one

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:90%
of the trips that I had.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And there, I remember that
the Canary Islands represent

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
the Hesperides Garden, which
is a very ancient story

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:90%
from the Greek culture.

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So these people were the
keepers of the tree of life,

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and the dragon was taking
care of the tree of life.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:84%
The dragon was this protector
of this information there.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So the tree of life
had golden apples.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:10%
And the Golden
apples represented

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:10%
the notes of the planet.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:10%
It was the information of
every realm in the reality.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:10%
And we were working related
to create the tree of life

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:10%
in a tree that there it's called
the dragon, the dragon tree.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So I said, which
is the dragon that

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:90%
is taking care of the apples?

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow the map,
the dragon is Scandinavia.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And the crown chakra of
Scandinavia is Svalbard.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Svalbard for
nine days on a boat heading

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:90%
to the Arctic Ocean.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was sowing the runes
for opening a bridge,

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:84%
a rainbow bridge to
bring the information

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
from the magnetic field
and try to figure out

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:14.580 align:middle line:84%
where is the system broken
from the crown of the dragon.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The Arctic is called like
that because arcus, that

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:90%
means bear and is the North.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the king of the
kings of the planet, which

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.890 align:middle line:90%
is the North Pole.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So the North Pole
is actually called

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Arcturus as the star of the king
of the kings and King Arthur

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So, again, I came to
the Excalibur star.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
In that trip, I had to share
my room with an Israeli guy

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:90%
that his name was Itai.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And Itai was the
word that Odin used

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.920 align:middle line:84%
to describe the
seed of water that I

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:84%
need to prepare to transform
the inside of the people.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But he said that name when I
was in Paraguay being kidnapped.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.240 align:middle line:10%
Many years ago in 2012,
when I was kidnapped,

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:10%
Odin appeared and
said to me that.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:22.619 align:middle line:10%
And then in the North, that
name came up again saying,

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:27.210 align:middle line:10%
this is the water, the water of
the North of the Arctic Ocean

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:10%
that has the information to
be activated with the honey.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:10%
And when I was asking myself
why I have to follow the apple,

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.730 align:middle line:10%
Vylansa and Aubrey Marcus
called me and said,

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.160 align:middle line:10%
"We are going to Greece.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to come
with us in a few days?"

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Because they had a vision that
I was supposed to be in Delphi.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.520 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:17:52.520 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Delphi actually means womb.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
first place on Earth

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:84%
that Gea was called the
Spirit of Gea, which is Gaia.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's the origin
of the name of Gaia.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So in the womb of Gaia,
there was a design

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
of the rotten apple that told
the story of the controlling

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:84%
the planet of how
everything is rotten.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's related to
the Apple of Discord.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the myth of Paris
choosing the most beauty--

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:90%
of the goddesses.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:90%
He chose love.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Because of his choice,
the War of Troy happened.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:59.100 align:middle line:10%
The conflict that happened
between Greece and Troy

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:10%
released a goddess
that nobody usually

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.130 align:middle line:10%
talks about, which is Ate.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:10%
And Ate is the goddess
of destruction.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.210 align:middle line:10%
It's the goddess of
the rotten things,

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:10%
which is basically the goddess
that designed the apple.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So Ate, she was hidden in
the war, destroying war,

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
like a Trojan Horse,
but in a different way.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:10%
She hide in the hearts of
the people that left Troy.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:10%
And when they escaped,
they went to Rome.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And the Trojan
people founded Rome.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So my guides said to me,
you have to go to Troy

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:90%
and to find Ate.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:90%
So I went to Troy.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:54.720 align:middle line:10%
And following the patterns
and the lines of the geometry,

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:10%
they started to show me
this philosopher's stone

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:10%
between Canary Islands, Egypt,
and Svalbard in the North.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you put all
that together and connect

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:84%
the philosopher's stone going
to the geometry in the center,

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.360 align:middle line:90%
you find Liechtenstein.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Liechtenstein is a small country
besides Switzerland, which means

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:90%
the bright or golden stone.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's the heart of the system.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, we have to solve
many different conflicts around

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand
what should we do there

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
in the heart of the system to
repair the first original one

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and open again, the
door of Egypt and so on.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:10%
So the rotten apple was
built in between the seven

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:10%
hills of a sleepy
beauty, which is Rome.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:10%
So when you see the map of
Rome, you start to see a cube.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:03.170 align:middle line:90%
And that design's Pandora's box.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Rome to
see the other part.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:10%
I started to walk
around the city trying

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.550 align:middle line:10%
to find the corners of the
square of the box, Pandora's

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:10%
box, which took me back to live,
again, the story of Rome amor--

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:10%
how to transcend Rome into love.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.360 align:middle line:10%
So this transition into--
from one system to another

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:10%
was coming again.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So all the paths that I
did before, everything

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing and I thought
it's finished, it unlocked

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:84%
a different level
of all this, like,

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.950 align:middle line:84%
all the stories were making
sense again altogether.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And I started to find
pyramids and obelisks that

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:84%
shape the structure,
that shape the box.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:10%
And the same routes of
and the streets of Rome

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.090 align:middle line:10%
shapes from above this system.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:84%
As I was talking with
Robert Grant there in Rome,

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
he was talking about something
related to double the cube.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And by seeing how the
system of Rome was designed,

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle line:84%
you can see the
cube being doubled.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And it shows you the idea of
transcending Pandora's box

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:84%
into Metatron's cube, which
is the expansion of the divine

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
instead of the evils inside,
using the inner power of Rome

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:40.060 align:middle line:84%
to make love as we were
trying to do a few years ago.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So all this system
that was detailed

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:84%
with numbers and frequencies and
all these stories of mythology

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:84%
coming together told
me about there is

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:90%
a stone where there is a sword.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And that stone is the
philosopher's stone.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:90%
And the sword is Excalibur.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:84%
But the stone is Earth that
is hurt, it's a broken heart.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And the stone in
Latin is petrus.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.610 align:middle line:90%
And the sword carved is a cross.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:10%
And St. Peter's Square is
the stone with the cross.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:10%
So he said, you need to restore
the system of the apples

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.110 align:middle line:10%
in order to take this sword--

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.930 align:middle line:10%
the cross of Excalibur--

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:10%
from the North--

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:52.350 align:middle line:10%
Arcturus-- and take it
back on the top, releasing

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:57.090 align:middle line:10%
the tension of the planet so the
magnetic field can flow again

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:02.850 align:middle line:10%
and it's not covered
by Rome, but by love,

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:10%
which is a lightning going up.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:90%
It's the opposite system.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, so what is the place
where all the apples of the tree

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:17.760 align:middle line:84%
have been spread in order
to restore the inside

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:84%
to be able to take the sword and
to create the opposite system?

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So they said, the place where
all the apples grow together.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient languages,
the island of apples

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.910 align:middle line:90%
is called Avalon.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And Avalon is all
England and Scotland.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So the path of the apples
is every stone circle

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:90%
in this island.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the restoring of the
power of the feminine,

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:84%
of the queen bee becoming a
high frequency of the heart,

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:03.230 align:middle line:84%
restoring the system that
goes all around the planet

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:84%
because after Rome, England
was the second system that

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.400 align:middle line:90%
spread around the planet.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Before I had no idea why we
were coming exactly to England.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.300 align:middle line:84%
I knew that it was
an enchanted path.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.480 align:middle line:84%
But now I know that
what we have to do

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.800 align:middle line:84%
is to go through the
sword of Excalibur

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.290 align:middle line:84%
to see the reflection of
each one of the apples

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
that is cut in half
and put it together

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.710 align:middle line:84%
in each one of the circles
going through all the island,

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:84%
reconnecting the positive
and negative of every chakra,

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and restoring the rotten apples
in order to be the tree of life

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.400 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And that story is
everywhere in every culture.

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But all of them
started to make sense.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And what they told me was
that all this story is

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:84%
being downloaded to me
now to put it together.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So I know exactly what
my next task is in 2024.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm still trying
to understand

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.560 align:middle line:84%
the connection
between all of that

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:90%
because it's a very long story.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't told
that to anybody.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.864 align:middle line:90%
So I'm still waiting.

00:26:30.864 --> 00:26:33.080 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.420 align:middle line:84%
When I got to the
tour, the whole group

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.655 align:middle line:90%
already started activation.

00:26:37.655 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:10%
[CHANTING]

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:10%
Creating this circle,
dancing, and chanting it

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.450 align:middle line:10%
was so powerful, so beautiful.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:10%
[CHANTING]

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:90%
