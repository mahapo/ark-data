00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Matias De Stefano.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.580 align:middle line:90%
And my purpose is to remember.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.310 align:middle line:84%
At a young age, I
began to remember

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:84%
living in a colony of
the ancient civilization

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.120 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Then, I began to remember
living on other planets

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:84%
in another star
system and dimensions.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I started to understand
how everything I remember

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
has a purpose in my
mission here and now.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:84%
To help reconnect the network
of consciousness of planet Earth

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:84%
in a plan that in Atlantis
we called Ater Tumti,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:90%
bring heaven on Earth.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:84%
This mission began
with organizing

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:84%
a gathering of thousands of
people to create that network.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Then, I was guided on a journey
to over 40 countries, where

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I deposited special keys in
50 sacred Kundalini chakra

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
locations on the planet
to help open these portals

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and activate humanity's
true potential as neurons

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:84%
The more the portals
open like flowers

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, the more
flow of energy for everyone.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:84%
For the planet Earth, not
just humans, not just trees,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.620 align:middle line:84%
but everything on this
planet, our home, ourselves.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.450 align:middle line:84%
I've encountered dark energies
manifesting earthquakes, being

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
kidnapped, and have survived
several near disasters, all

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:84%
as a part of mission that I
started over 12,000 years ago

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:90%
in the age of Leo.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
In this age, I can now
spread this ancient knowledge

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
all over the world
to enormous crowds

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and to millions
over the internet.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:90%
This is my mission.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:90%
I hope it helps you find yours.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:10%
Everything that I am doing
right now, everything

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:10%
that I am doing in my life,
it's aligned to my mission.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:10%
And I guess that I don't
do much besides what

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:10%
I am supposed to do.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:84%
But this is not something
that right now bothers me,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:90%
because I'm enjoying it.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoy doing what I do.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And to go all around the world
and to connect all these nodes

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.490 align:middle line:84%
of energy and to share and
teach people about my memories,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:84%
this is something that for
me right now is something

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:90%
I live in balance with.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:90%
But it was not always like this.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I have always been related
to the spiritual world,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:84%
because since I was
born, they were there.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.063 align:middle line:90%
I could see them.

00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:84%
They were talking to me,
they were teaching me

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.140 align:middle line:84%
how to be in this world, how to
handle the reality as a human.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:84%
They would teach me how to
understand the other person,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
how to be a friend,
how to go to school,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:84%
how to learn, how to
feel, how to think.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I felt
like I was the spirit

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:84%
on holidays in a weird country
that we called planet Earth.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And they were
constantly in my life.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:90%
For me, they were family.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.140 align:middle line:84%
All these beings from
other dimensions,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:90%
they were my friends.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
They are calling me to see,
hey, how are you doing?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I cannot see them, they are
in other worlds, but for me,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:90%
are family or friends.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And there was a moment
when they told me,

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:90%
now you have to remember.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Now you will remember.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Not only see us and remember
us from other dimensions,

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:90%
but also remember your soul.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So when I was 11, 12 years old,
I started to remember my lives.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And all the emotion was the only
way in which I could remember.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
It was not like
information, it was

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:84%
emotion of all the beings, all
the people that I have been

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:90%
and that I have been with.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:84%
My family was
agnostic, so they had

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:90%
no idea about spiritual things.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:90%
But they were creative.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
My mom was creative,
so she loved

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:84%
to listen what I was
saying, like if I was just

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.040 align:middle line:90%
having a lot of imagination.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And that I had no idea how
to handle the imagination.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I thought many
times I was getting crazy,

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.250 align:middle line:84%
until I started to find many
others that also remembered.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a
child, I had no idea

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:84%
about what I was doing,
why I was doing this.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And they told me, in a few
years when it will be 2012,

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:84%
you have to connect and talk
with many people in the world.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And your mission will start.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
ready for that moment.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was supposed to
be 24 years old in 2012,

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, I don't know
how I'm going to do anything

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:84%
that you are saying,
because I don't

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:90%
know how to speak with people.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:90%
I really was afraid of people.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really want to be in
touch with the spiritual world.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Along the years, I started
to accept my nature,

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:90%
like being this weird person.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
I never was afraid of saying
what was happening to me.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I was always sharing
with my mom, mostly

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.520 align:middle line:84%
my friends, everything
that I was remembering,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:90%
everything that I was feeling.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.860 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to become
a teacher so I

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:10%
could help others like me that
were coming to this world,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:10%
to have idea of how to
survive here, to learn how

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:10%
to live in this world and not
to forget and to be balanced

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.030 align:middle line:10%
in this reality.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:10%
That's why I went
to study education.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:84%
My mission is
bounded by education.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I just want to help people
to understand or to help

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.740 align:middle line:90%
to remember.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, one of
my guides told me,

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:84%
if you are not
centered in yourself,

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:84%
if you don't work
with your spirit,

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:84%
with your own mind
and your own soul

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and you don't heal your
history and you don't realize

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.070 align:middle line:84%
why you have gone
through all this path,

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.520 align:middle line:84%
so you are not going to
be able to help anybody.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:84%
You are not going to be able
to bring heaven on Earth.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:84%
First, you need to go through
all the process of yourself

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and to recognize the
power of your own spirit

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:84%
so you could do what
you have come to do.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Every time that I wanted to
go through the path of working

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.830 align:middle line:84%
in education or society or
politics, the whole path

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:24.290 align:middle line:84%
took me away so I could
go back to my nature.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I was trying to
be someone that I was not.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And this was one of the
times that I realized

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:84%
about that was when I
was in the university

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing this
career of psychopathology

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:84%
to help in schools, and suddenly
my guides came and said,

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:90%
you don't belong in this place.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You have learned everything
that you needed to learn,

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:90%
and you have to leave.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was fighting with them,
saying, no, I won't leave here.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
In this world you need
a title to be believed,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.680 align:middle line:84%
you need a degree,
so people could say,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:90%
OK, this person knows something.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So until I don't
finish my university,

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I won't leave this place and
I won't start my mission.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly that
month, I started

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:84%
to have problems
in the university.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I failed in every class.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I started to speak in
different languages.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes forgot
how to speak Spanish.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So I was having all
these kind of problems,

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:84%
until I just decided, OK,
I have to leave university.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I did that, and
suddenly the people started

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:84%
to wonder what I
was talking about,

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
so I started to share
my vision of education.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly they said, but
why do you have this vision?

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Why-- from where it comes from?

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And I started to explain my
memories and all the things

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:84%
that I know from the
universe and to explain

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:84%
why the new children are being
born and the new consciousness

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly I understood that
my job was not with kids,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:84%
it was with the parents
and the teachers.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:84%
They started to ask me a
lot of questions to film

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
what I was saying and they
invited me to congresses

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
to make speeches and
to speak out loud.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is how I
ended up in YouTube.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people started
to watch what I was sharing.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Even though I had
not much idea of what

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:90%
I was sharing precisely.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But doing all this process,
when I started to do that,

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.770 align:middle line:84%
I realized how many people
were remembering also like me.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And everyone was saying, I
remember exactly the same,

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.383 align:middle line:90%
but you organized that.

00:09:48.383 --> 00:09:51.490 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.320 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
people that thought

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.630 align:middle line:84%
that I know many things, but
I never considered myself

00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:59.660 align:middle line:90%
knowing things.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.630 align:middle line:90%
I just remember things.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I was feeling like
people believe that I am wise

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:90%
because of what I'm explaining.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not wise, I'm just
repeating like a parrot

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:90%
what my spirit says.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.900 align:middle line:90%
My personality is not like that.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:84%
My personality wants
just to enjoy, to play,

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.275 align:middle line:90%
and to get fun in this reality.

00:10:23.275 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I was 23 years old
approximately when

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
during a worship in
Menorca in Spain,

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I was talking in
front of 300 people,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly I
forgot everything.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I felt like empty,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and my guides told me,
we are cleaning you,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:84%
because this is the only
moment you are connected.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the only moment when we
can download new information.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So they told me in
the end of this year,

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:84%
you have to make a
gathering so people

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:10.590 align:middle line:84%
could gather in the capital of
the inner world of Argentina.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And you have to call them to
be all together in the day

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:90%
11-11-11.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And that day you will
receive the next steps,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:90%
so you will start your mission.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:32.350 align:middle line:84%
When I received this information
of the 11-11-11, they told me,

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:84%
this is why that
date is special.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the mind of many people
are connected to the same idea.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:90%
That makes that day a portal.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:84%
We need that day to
download information

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
to start to reconnect
the network of thinking

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.460 align:middle line:84%
of something that
was beyond humans

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:84%
is the network, the
network consciousness.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:04.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
This organization
of the gathering

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:84%
was not only about how do
we organize the logistics

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
for this gathering, it
was also about facing

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:84%
all these conflicts
in other dimensions.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:84%
We had to go to a
spot in Argentina

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.030 align:middle line:90%
called Capilla De Monte.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:84%
In this region, there is
a specific energetic spot

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.560 align:middle line:84%
where all the remnants
of the cosmos went there,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and they hold all
information of the Earth.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So we went there to receive
guidance of what we have to do.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So they told us we needed
to go to specific spots

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:90%
to clean the energy.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So when the gathering
was held in that region,

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
we would be able to move
the energy correctly.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Our goal was to heal the
territory of Argentina

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.310 align:middle line:90%
for the future.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:84%
They told us in 200
years, this region

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
would be one of the most
important to reestablish

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:90%
the order of a new civilization.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So in order to be
that, we needed

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:84%
to face the darkness that
was keeping this energy.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:28.560 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So while my mom
and other friends

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.390 align:middle line:84%
were organizing the logistics
in the city, with other friends

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
we went to these
spots of Argentina

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.240 align:middle line:84%
to make the cleaning
of this energy.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.940 align:middle line:90%
We went to four provinces.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.210 align:middle line:10%
One of them in Salta
in the Atacama Desert.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:10%
The other one in La Rioja, which
is a region called Talampaya.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.560 align:middle line:10%
Then the other one in
Aconcagua in Mendoza.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:10%
And the other one
Nahuel Huapi, which

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:10%
is a lake in Neuquen
and Rio Negro.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:10%
These regions that we
have to go to anchor

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:10%
is energy and clean,
where the main regions

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:10%
that represented the
throat chakra of Argentina,

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.360 align:middle line:10%
the liver of Argentina,
the kidneys of Argentina

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.340 align:middle line:10%
and the root chakra.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So by cleaning those
portals, it would

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.760 align:middle line:84%
be easier to move the energy in
the core, which is the plexus,

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:90%
in Cordoba.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.400 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
stories that I had

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
was when we went to Salta, and
in the middle of the desert,

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.790 align:middle line:84%
we were driving to the
volcano that we were

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.340 align:middle line:90%
supposed to go in a rental car.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
heading to that region,

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:53.690 align:middle line:84%
we saw this dark energy
coming and rolling the car.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:90%
And the car started to spin.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:84%
All the glass broke,
and everything

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:90%
started to come inside the car.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:84%
We had an accident in
the middle of the desert.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.520 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
After all the
rollings that we did

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.210 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the desert,
nothing happened to us.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.270 align:middle line:90%
We were like, clean.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And we went outside the car
and an ambulance just stopped.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't believe
that, but the ambulance

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
was right behind us,
200 kilometers away

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:90%
from every city.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we
saw the accident.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So my guides told me, you
have to say the truth always,

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:90%
don't lie.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So I went to them and said,
well, energetically black snake

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.050 align:middle line:84%
rolled the car, and
so the car was broken.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yes,
yes, OK, these things

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.170 align:middle line:84%
happen here, so we will
take you to the doctor.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.360 align:middle line:90%
So we went to this city.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor, she
also said, yes, we

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
know that these
things happen here.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a very special place.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And even the policemen said
that they offer constantly

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:84%
in ceremonies fruits to the
Earth, to the Pachamama,

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
because they know that bad
spirits are in that region.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:25.950 align:middle line:84%
So we could speak freely
with the whole population.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:84%
When I started to
go around the planet

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and to go to these
mountains and portals,

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
there were always dark beings
in every one of those places.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And some people would say Matias
is working with dark energies.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But when you are in the
matter, what you realize,

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:84%
is that the high vibrational
beings that are in other

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:90%
dimensions cannot touch matter.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.350 align:middle line:90%
But the dark ones does.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So they are like the dogs
taking care of the temples.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Like, the ones that want to
bite you, to kill you so nobody

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.820 align:middle line:90%
could get into the portal.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
When you treat those
dogs like puppies

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and you thank them because
they were taking care of this,

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:14.050 align:middle line:84%
but don't worry, I will
respect this reality,

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:84%
I won't go against you,
they just allow you to go

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.310 align:middle line:90%
and they help you.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:90%
They guide you to the portal.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So we went to the mountain
again with another car.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking with these
dark beings around the mountain

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and they said, we are
only allow this energy

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:47.320 align:middle line:84%
to flow if you in exchange,
give us destruction.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So we could recreate our
world in this region.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:84%
So we said,
destruction like what?

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And they said, so it
would be an earthquake.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.080 align:middle line:84%
By the earthquake,
we would destroy it

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and we will raise energy
that we need for our world.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And we said, OK, but no deaths.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So we were fighting
and discussing

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
in the meeting, no death
in this earthquake.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.030 align:middle line:90%
So they agreed after a while.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And seven days
after that there was

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.835 align:middle line:84%
an earthquake in that region
that destroyed many villages.

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But there was no harm,
no people harmed.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
When that happened, we knew that
we were ready to keep going.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So we went to La Rioja
and in La Rioja we also

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:90%
did this energetical cleaning.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Then in the other
mountain in Mendoza,

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:84%
told us that this,
what we were doing,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.900 align:middle line:90%
was for the future generations.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So they would give us
the energy for the kids.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So my goal was not
just to explain

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.190 align:middle line:84%
to the people what
we were doing,

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.030 align:middle line:84%
but also to talk with
the other dimensions,

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
to talk with the beings that
usually everyone sees that they

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:09.810 align:middle line:84%
are against us, and to bring
them to the same purpose

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:84%
to say, no, we understand
what you are doing,

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:90%
but we need to work together.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:90%
We are losing time fighting.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:84%
My guides pushed me towards
the darkness to face it

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and to teach me
something important.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
One of my biggest teachings
during the organization

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:33.060 align:middle line:84%
of the 11-11-11
was to be neutral.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And to be neutral, means not
to be working for the light,

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and neither for the
darkness, but to realize

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:84%
that both forces were
one working with just one

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:90%
goal, which was evolution.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I know that many people
think that the darkness is

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
working against evolution, but
it's not precisely like this.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just another
way of evolution.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:84%
They just want to evolve
in a different way

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:90%
and with different tools.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So what we needed to do,
was to find the balance.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:84%
This brought me
this peace inside

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
that I hadn't come here
like a light worker

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:84%
or like a warrior for the
light for the enlightenment,

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:23.090 align:middle line:84%
but more like someone
trying to find the balance

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and to connect the missing
links that separated all of us

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:32.117 align:middle line:84%
as not only human beings, but
also in different dimensions.

00:20:32.117 --> 00:20:36.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
That day in the morning,
we had these 6,000 people.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:84%
The whole day was
kind of like magic.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
you have to deliver keys

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:84%
in the specific portals to open
the Kundalini of the world.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.320 align:middle line:90%
