00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.460 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Matias De Stefano.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.750 align:middle line:90%
And my purpose is to remember.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.480 align:middle line:84%
At a young age, I
began to remember

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.150 align:middle line:84%
living in a colony of
the ancient civilization

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Then I'd begun to
remember living

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.970 align:middle line:84%
on other planets in other
star systems and dimensions.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I started to understand
how everything I remember

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.550 align:middle line:84%
has a purpose in my mission
here and now, to help reconnect

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:84%
the network of consciousness
of planet Earth in a plan

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.750 align:middle line:84%
that in Atlantis we called
Ater Tumti, bringing heaven

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.160 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:84%
This mission began
with organizing

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:84%
a gathering of thousands of
people to create that network.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:90%
This is my mission.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.530 align:middle line:90%
I hope it helps you find yours.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Many of the stories that I
lived along the Harwitum path,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:90%
I never told them.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:10%
But two most important stories
that I lived there in this trip

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:10%
were the one that
happened in Paraguay

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.115 align:middle line:10%
and the one that
happened in Antarctica.

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
The one that
happened in Paraguay

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:84%
was for me something
really heavy

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
but also something that made me
understand that we were really

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:84%
connected in
different dimensions.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:10%
I was supposed to go to a
mountain that is called Guazu.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:10%
It means big in the
native language.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:90%
I was supposed to go there.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:90%
And the borders were closed.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:84%
But there's no border really
in between Brazil and Paraguay.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:90%
So I just went to Paraguay.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Just crossed the street.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And I took a taxi and asked them
to take me to that mountain.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:90%
So he took me there.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.170 align:middle line:90%
But something funny happened.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.370 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's funny, but for
most of the people it wasn't.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:84%
That I was doing the
connection to understanding

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:90%
why the path took me to Guazu.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And they said there is
an important information

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:84%
in the waters below South
America in this region that

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:84%
will help awake the potential
of humanity in the future.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So you need to open
the portal here.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But in order for people to
know how important is this,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
we need you to show how
important is this place.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.850 align:middle line:84%
But I had no idea
how it would happen.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, I was doing the
connection, the meditation.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And from behind
of me there comes

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
this Native people with
an arrow and a bow,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and another one with a sword,
and other one with a gun.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
They stole the car, and
they took the taxi driver

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.560 align:middle line:90%
and myself into the woods.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:90%
And they kidnapped me.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being sad or
scared, I got frustrated.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I said, I can't die
here and start all over.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:84%
I just have two
countries more to go.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:90%
I can't die.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:90%
This is impossible.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So I start to argue with the
people that had the guns.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:84%
But they just let us in
the corner in the forest.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:90%
And there were a lot of dogs.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was playing with
the dogs, and they

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:90%
were treating them really bad.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.610 align:middle line:90%
I was friend with the dogs.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I just
relaxed myself, and I said,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:90%
what is going on?

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.270 align:middle line:84%
I was escaping to be
interviewed during the trip,

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:84%
because I was really scared
to talk in front of a camera.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt like they
were pointing me in the head.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:84%
But now I had a
big gun in my head.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, I will die here.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:84%
One of my guides just appears
very quietly around me.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And he just stared
at me and said,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
now you're not going to be
scared of cameras anymore.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And he just came
up with this joke

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:90%
that calmed me in such a way.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, don't worry,
everything is under control.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:90%
You just relax.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:90%
This was meant to happen.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:90%
So I started to hug trees.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, the
trees and humans,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:90%
we are the neurons of the world.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So people would know
what is happening.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to send
the images of everything

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:90%
that happened into the trees.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And what was incredible
was that that day a lot

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:84%
of people that were following
me started to dream,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
having all these nightmares
that I was kidnapped,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
or I was scared, or
something bad happened.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Even my family felt that.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So they started to wonder
what was happening to me.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they discover
that I disappeared.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And so everyone started
to move to find me.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
But the funny part was that
at night I was sleeping.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Even the taxi driver
didn't understand

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:90%
how I was able to sleep.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:90%
But I was sleeping.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And he woke me up and said,
I received a sign that--

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I saw a butterfly
coming to my chest.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And he had problems
with his heart.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And I have a butterfly
came to my chest.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like we can leave.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, I don't know
if you believe in these things.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, of course,
if a butterfly said it.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:90%
So let's go.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So we stood up, and we were
surrounded by the tents

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:90%
of the Indians around us.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.895 align:middle line:84%
And we just started to walk,
like escaping from the Indians

00:06:12.895 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:90%
like in a movie.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And because I was friend of
all the dogs, none of them

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:90%
made any noise.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Just moved the tail, like bye.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And we escaped.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:90%
We escaped from the woods.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And we got into
another spot that

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:84%
also was dangerous, we think,
because we kind of realized

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
that we were in a
drug dealer place.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But they called the
police, so we could

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.120 align:middle line:90%
be brought back to Brazil.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:90%
And I went back to Brazil.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:90%
And we kept following the trip.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, I realized that
all the people was connected,

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:90%
that we were really a network.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone felt
what was happening.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said the
secret of Paraguay

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:90%
is well kept by these people.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.940 align:middle line:84%
But I know that somehow
someday that region

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:84%
will awake some potential
that-- or will change something

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.320 align:middle line:90%
in humanity.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:84%
This trip ended when we arrived
to the south of Argentina

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:90%
in Tandil.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.600 align:middle line:84%
There is the womb of the mother
of the region of South America.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:84%
My guides were saying
that Argentina was

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:90%
the body of this new mother.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:84%
As Europe was the
old mother that

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.190 align:middle line:84%
created all our civilizations,
the new one in the future

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:90%
would be South America.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And the new consciousness
would be in Lake Titicaca.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So Bolivia would be
the head with a crown

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:90%
chakra in the Titicaca.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Bolivia would be the head of the
consciousness of the new time,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:84%
as Argentina is the
body, and the womb

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
is in Buenos Aires, and Chile,
the spine, Peru, the spirit.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So this body that all
these countries shaped,

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:84%
they needed to be
connected in order

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:84%
to receive all this information
from the opening of the energy

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.250 align:middle line:90%
that we did.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So all the information
from Africa and everywhere

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
must be seeded in order
to recreate a new energy.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.909 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I took soil from
each one of those countries,

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.740 align:middle line:84%
so I could put them all
together to seed a tree

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.860 align:middle line:90%
in the womb of Argentina.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:47.020 align:middle line:84%
We just did a big ceremony
that day with 3,000 people

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.940 align:middle line:90%
seeding this tree.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
do that gathering,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
first we went all around
these provinces and these four

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:84%
countries to connect
this information,

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
doing gatherings in
every public main square,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:90%
where we did meditations.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
purpose of our countries

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and the need of being all
together doing this connection.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So we connected all
these foreign countries.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:24.055 align:middle line:84%
And from there, started our last
trip that was in December 21.

00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.690 align:middle line:84%
People thought that December 21
would be the end of the world.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Because according to
the Mayan calendar,

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:84%
that date would be
the end of an era

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of a new one.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So everyone was
concerned that that day

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:90%
would be the end of everything.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that
it was not an end.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.010 align:middle line:84%
It was the beginning
of the new time.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:84%
So what we needed to do was
to seed the consciousness

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:84%
of the world the
idea of laughing,

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:90%
of love, of this new time.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:10%
And because of the crown chakra
of the world is Antarctica,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:10%
we needed to open
that last portal,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:10%
allowing the mind of
the world to realize

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:10%
that this new time should
be full of laughter,

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:10%
of love, of good energy
and consciousness,

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:10%
not fear of the ending.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.410 align:middle line:84%
After all this path of
Harwitum and the great mother,

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:84%
the great woman of South
America, our next goal

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.370 align:middle line:90%
was to go to Antarctica.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
But I had only one week
before that to discover how I

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:90%
was going to go to Antarctica.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
We just discovered
a company that

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:90%
takes tourists to go there.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And we were supposed to be the
21st of December in Antarctica.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
no flights that day.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.320 align:middle line:90%
And they arranged the flights.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So they were saying
weather wouldn't be good

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.910 align:middle line:90%
that day to travel.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, we are going
to arrange the weather issues.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.140 align:middle line:90%
And my friends will do that.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were
like, which friends

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.070 align:middle line:90%
would arrange the weather?

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:84%
It was funny, because I
was not supposed to lie.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to say
everything that was happening.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And then said, well,
we have this kind

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:90%
of weird organization that--

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.230 align:middle line:90%
we work in different dimensions.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:90%
So they will take care of it.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:90%
And that day was perfect.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.930 align:middle line:84%
The thing was that the
last key was supposed

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:90%
to be brought to Antarctica.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And the guy that made the
keys hid the main key from me,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:84%
like a kind of golem that got
in love with the first key

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:90%
that he made.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he
didn't make any other.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But the first one that was
supposed to go in Antarctica,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.840 align:middle line:90%
he hid it in the mountains.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go to the
mountains with him

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and convince him to come
to Antarctica with me

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:90%
to bring that key.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I convinced him, but
he lost the flight.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So somehow we
accomplished to find

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:84%
a pilot that just
flew with the key

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and took the key to the
last edge of the world just

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.850 align:middle line:84%
to give it to me, so I
could go to Antarctica

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:84%
to bring that to
open the portal.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So we flew to
Antarctica the next day

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:84%
in the early morning
of December 21.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And we have only two
hours to decide what to do

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and where to go.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:10%
So we run fast, and we
did all this connection

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:10%
in between the penguins.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And we seed the key in
the waters of Antarctica

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:90%
to open the portal that day.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:90%
And we ran back to the plane.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we were trying to
take off, the plane broke.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And we almost fell in the
sea of the Antarctica sea.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:84%
The pilot managed to
stop the airplane.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:90%
And he said, let's try again.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So he tried again,
and it couldn't.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:90%
So he said, we need to stay.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So we stayed for two
days more in Antarctica

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:84%
sleeping there with
the scientists.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to receive
the messages of the next step

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.880 align:middle line:90%
that we had to give.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And the message that we received
was that in February 2013

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:84%
there would be a
lightning turning the key

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.060 align:middle line:90%
of the north towards the south.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And that that
lightning will tell us

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
that the power from the
south will go to the north

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and would be the sign to turn
the biggest key of the world.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:84%
I was given the keys
along the Harwitum path.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And by the message
they said, there

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:84%
is a bigger key, the biggest
key of the whole planet,

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that when that turns from
north to south, giving

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:22.440 align:middle line:84%
the power to the people from the
south, every key of the world

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:84%
will start to change, to turn,
opening the heavens into Earth.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be there to
balance that opening in 2014.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea of what
they were speaking about.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But in February, we saw the
lightning coming from the skies

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:90%
to the biggest key.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And that big key is the Vatican.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:53.670 align:middle line:10%
And that lightning was the
day when the pope quit.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:10%
And one month later, an
Argentinean pope was elected.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So the south went to the
north, to the biggest key.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.360 align:middle line:10%
So that was the beginning
of the next adventure

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:10%
that was to help to turn
the key and to change

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:10%
the energy of Rome.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Something that we learned
during the Harwitum

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:25.180 align:middle line:84%
was that every temple in
the world is like a key.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Every temple that a human
goes and puts faith in it

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:84%
is like a portal in between
the consciousness of heaven

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:90%
and the consciousness of Earth.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So even if religion
doesn't really

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
matter for the universe,
the aspects and the codes

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:90%
that it have are important.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.930 align:middle line:84%
This is why we
believed in that time

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:56.720 align:middle line:84%
that by opening the
portals in those temples,

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:84%
in those natural
places, we would

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:84%
be able to spread the
consciousness in a faster way

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:90%
than going people to people.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:10.310 align:middle line:10%
So this was the message
of going to the Vatican.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:90%
The Vatican is the biggest key.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:84%
It was built by
Bernini, given the shape

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of a key, the key of
heavens, of Saint Peter.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Even if I am not Catholic--

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:90%
I am not Christian.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And even if I'm not
following any religion,

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:84%
there's something
that we cannot deny,

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's that Christianity
reached the whole world.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Every continent has a church.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Every town has a church.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And they even build the
churches and the cathedrals

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
over the sacred places of
every culture in the past.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So this means that these
churches and cathedrals

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
are like the portals of not
only their own religion,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.920 align:middle line:84%
but the portals of
every faith in the past.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:10%
If the Vatican
changes its vibration

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:10%
and opens the portal in
between the dimensions--

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:10%
so like changing the
main core of the system,

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:10%
all the rest of the
churches would be also

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:10%
turning and opening
the new network.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So what they said was, you
have to do exactly the opposite

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:90%
to what the church did.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:10%
The religion of Christianity
put all the country together,

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.520 align:middle line:10%
all the empire together
under one only God,

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:10%
than having many gods,
so many governments.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:10%
So Rome created the system.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:10%
Even our law system,
our government system,

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:10%
was coming from Rome.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And from there, it spread
to the whole world.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we turned the word
Rome, which in Spanish is Amor

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:90%
and means love.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So Roma Amor would
be the next step

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
of the Harwitum path to opening
every portal in the planet

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:90%
just by turning one.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:10%
This happened by creating a big
network of people in America,

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:10%
bringing the energy
towards Spain and Portugal,

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:10%
and from Spain and Portugal
going to Italy, and from Italy

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:10%
to Rome, and from
Rome to the Vatican.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Exactly the opposite path that
Rome took to the whole world,

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:35.770 align:middle line:84%
we did it backwards like a
reflection, like a mirror.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.720 align:middle line:10%
One of the things was
not criticize the church,

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:10%
not to go against
the church like they

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:10%
did against all the people
that thought different.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So what we had to do was
to bring love and bring

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.390 align:middle line:90%
this energy of change.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:84%
We just wanted to share with
the Vatican the idea of,

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.760 align:middle line:84%
we all are one in this world,
and we all have to transcend.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
We should not be
always the same.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And we are here asking you
to go with us in this change.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing of this story
was that I went to Spain.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was supposed to raise
money to go to the Vatican

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and to make all
this trip by myself.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.960 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, a lot of people
were willing to join the trip

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and following the
trip and helping

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:90%
me to get to all these places.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And my guides told me,
you have to go to Rome

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.540 align:middle line:84%
to wait for a call
in a specific square.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to go to
Piazza del Popolo

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:90%
and wait there for the calling.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I took a flight to Rome
and just sat there every day

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:84%
for three days waiting a call
that I had no idea what it was.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So I put a picture
on Instagram saying,

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm here waiting for the
call of the pope as a joke.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, someone that
was in a spiritual trip

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:84%
in Scotland, they
saw the picture

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and shared it with
the people in the bus.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And one woman from
the bus said, I

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
am friend from the
secretary of the pope.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.040 align:middle line:90%
We went to school together.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I can give him the number.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So a few hours later, with no
idea about anything of this,

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I received the calling of the
secretary of the pope that

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.258 align:middle line:90%
told me, what do you want?

00:20:29.258 --> 00:20:30.300 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't know.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:90%
You called me.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- so, OK,
come to the office

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.700 align:middle line:90%
and explain what you want.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the Vatican
and explained all this story

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
about all my guides telling
me to come to turn the keys

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and do this work
of Rome to love.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And they just told
me, sure, you are

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:56.170 align:middle line:84%
free to come and to do your
meditations in St. Peter's

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Square.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.880 align:middle line:84%
A month later, we
came, 400 people.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And we started to do the
meditations in a beautiful day.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And we started to make
all this turning of energy

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:90%
in St. Peter's Square.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, like in
every gathering I did,

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:90%
the storm came.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And these big
lightnings were falling.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And we were the only ones in the
streets, 400 crazy people doing

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:84%
meditations below the storm
and all this lightning,

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:90%
and barefoot in the water.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.580 align:middle line:90%
And nobody was there.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:84%
The storm was so big that
it was even in the news,

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.420 align:middle line:90%
because it was a big storm.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, my guide said, the
portal is going to be opened.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So you have all to go in
the middle of the square.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:90%
So we all went there.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, from all
these lightnings coming,

00:21:53.040 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:10%
there was one that just hit
the Vatican and the cupola.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:84%
The energy vibrates so much
that all the windows started

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.025 align:middle line:90%
to vibrate and made this noise.

00:22:09.025 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the sun rises
behind the Vatican.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.955 align:middle line:10%
And two big rainbows opened
in the door of the Vatican.

00:22:18.955 --> 00:22:21.620 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.027 align:middle line:84%
The rainbows are
like the portals

00:22:23.027 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:84%
in between all the
dimensions, because

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:84%
of the light and every
perspective of the light.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So these two big rainbows
opening the portal

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:84%
of the Vatican, and the
lightning, and the sun,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly we were all
dancing and celebrating

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:40.150 align:middle line:90%
like in the 11-11.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:84%
It was like the closing of
the process from the 11-11

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.020 align:middle line:90%
to turning this energy.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, the
secretary called me.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we
saw everything that

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:90%
happened through the window.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So you are invited
to come in two days

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.410 align:middle line:84%
to give this message
to the pope, whatever

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:90%
you want to give.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:09.590 align:middle line:10%
So I just brought a box with
all the messages of everything

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:14.570 align:middle line:10%
that we have done, all the
stories that we have lived,

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:10%
and the stories that we are
willing to open in the future.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And that we have to be all
together in order to do so.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So we tried to heal the
history of the religion,

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:38.930 align:middle line:84%
so we could follow the next
teachings of the Christ

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:84%
that was the
concept of the I am.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of
the Harwitum path,

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.340 align:middle line:84%
at the end of Roma Amor
path, we knew somehow

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:84%
that the next step would
be to work with the I am.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:90%
