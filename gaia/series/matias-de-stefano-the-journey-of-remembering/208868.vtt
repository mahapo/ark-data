00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.466 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:31.585 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>> After we charged this crystal
with information in the Salt

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Flat, we came to the lake to
see where it was supposed to be

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:90%
seeded.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:10%
I didn't usually go to the
places knowing where we go

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:10%
or what do we have to do.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.260 align:middle line:10%
Because I know that in every
place, it would be different.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And if I am thinking
what should I do,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.210 align:middle line:84%
it will be difficult to
really flow and to really

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:90%
find the place.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So I learn along the
way that it's better

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:84%
to just flow and
not expect anything

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:84%
where you are going to do some
work with other dimensions,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.495 align:middle line:84%
because they know
better than us.

00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:19.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So when I was around here,
I got lost a little bit,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
because I was supposed to
go to the shore of the lake.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
But there was no
way to reach it.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that was in that
position, in that part.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:84%
But it was difficult. One of
the things that I asked once

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:84%
to my guides was, why it has
to be so difficult to get

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:90%
to this spot to do something?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And they said, because if it's
easy, you won't get the clues.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't
understand the path.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
You cannot understand
why you are doing it.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So when it's hard, you can find
easily the science to show you

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:90%
so you can understand.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So I was asking what
do we have to do.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
native spirit that came

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:90%
talking in another language.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.830 align:middle line:10%
But I could understand it
inside that she was saying,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:10%
follow your totem, your totem.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And for me, my totem,
throughout all this process,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:90%
was the pyramid.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.935 align:middle line:84%
So I was following the
pyramid, where is the pyramid.

00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:84%
These are the kinds of clues
that when you do the long path,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
you figure out and you
say, oh, this is it.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they said
to me, find your totem,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:90%
which is the pyramid.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramid must be
aligned with the sun.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:90%
So OK, let's follow there.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And we are supposed to
seed this for the planet.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking for something
representing the planet

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:84%
or something that makes
me think that this

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
is a spot for connecting
with the planet.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, in
middle of nowhere,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:84%
there is a ball, a very old
ball aligned with the pyramid

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:90%
and the sun right now.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's
the perfect Trinity.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:10%
You can see when sometimes,
some people may say,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:10%
this is just a silly
thing or doesn't

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:10%
have any sense or any meaning.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But one of the amazing
things of the universe

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
is that the patterns are
all around and everywhere.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And even the most horrible
and stinky places,

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:84%
you could find the same
patterns everywhere.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's just to pay
attention to them

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and not to have this
pre-concept of the things.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:84%
You just see the
truth everywhere

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:90%
when you just open yourself.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.079 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like a perfect symbol
for me to say it's here.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.060 align:middle line:84%
It was perfectly
aligned with everything.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And these kind of
things are incredible,

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.030 align:middle line:84%
because they're tiny
signals that sometimes it

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:90%
could be silly.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But when you start to follow
the signals through the path,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:84%
anything can be
telling you something.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you're
walking through the mountain,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and you have to see every
flower and everything

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
to show you where is the
path so you don't get lost.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So anything could be
helpful to understand

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:90%
where you are supposed to be.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:84%
These things, I
usually do alone.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's no one
there to see it

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.200 align:middle line:84%
unless we are with a group of
people doing a specific task

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that everyone sees and someone
is filming with the phone.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's difficult to program
what is going to happen.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And there is a moment that
when I start to connect,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
everything gets weird,
and I cannot say,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:90%
do this or will happen that.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I just start to flow
and pay attention

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:90%
to what the beings are saying.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I was on the
shore of the lake,

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:84%
this same native person
comes and tells me,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.340 align:middle line:90%
walk into the water.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So I walked into the
water, but it was all mud.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.300 align:middle line:84%
It seems sand, but
you could sink on it.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:84%
When I was there, she
said, feel who you are.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:90%
You are a human.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.055 align:middle line:90%
Say it.

00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:12.855 align:middle line:90%
I am human.

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.066 align:middle line:90%
I am human.

00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:21.740 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
She was saying, feel
the mud, feel the mud.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] This
made me feel so stabilized

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.620 align:middle line:90%
in the mud.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, it got warm.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was nice and
comfortable to be there

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:90%
in the water with the mud.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And she started asking
me, what is a human?

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.910 align:middle line:90%
What is a human?

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:90%
What is to be a human?

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.365 align:middle line:90%
What is to be a human?

00:06:57.365 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
She said, to be a
human is to be mud.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And she started to
explain what is to be mud.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And she told me,
cover yourself in mud,

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:90%
and your hands, your face.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I was just putting a little
bit and say, no, no, no.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:90%
The face.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Cover your face with mud.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Feel the mud.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Become the mud.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:84%
She said, usually we
could say that mud is

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:90%
something disgusting or dirty.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we compare humans
with mud, we could say but why?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:84%
We should be light,
or enlightened,

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:90%
or something like this.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Why to be just the mud?

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:49.086 align:middle line:84%
And she said, there is
that divinity in mud.

00:07:49.086 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:90%
Mud is not what it is.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Mud is what you can do with it.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the potential of the
universe to create life.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:18.470 align:middle line:90%
Mud created life.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Mud created hope.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.285 align:middle line:90%
Mud created core.

00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.022 align:middle line:90%
Mud created food.

00:08:30.022 --> 00:08:33.459 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:90%
Mud created family.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:90%
And therefore love.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:90%
So mud is the creator.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:90%
So you are mud.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:90%
And you are made of it.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's to be a human,
to be water and Earth.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:90%
She started to explain that.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, she
said, what are you--

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:09.360 align:middle line:84%
what have you come to sow here
in this waters that is ours?

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I came to bring this
information from other levels,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:84%
from other dimensions that
are trying to contact us

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
so we could connect
with everything

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and expand the
consciousness of the planet.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And she was asking me,
what is the consciousness?

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:84%
What is the information
that you want to give?

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't know.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a bridge.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I just expect for everything
to be connected to--

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.530 align:middle line:84%
for humanity to
be able to awaken

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:90%
this new path in this new time.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And she said, we have been
receiving from the horizon

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:84%
messages from all over
the world constantly

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:90%
since the very beginning.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of
years, we have been

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:20.100 align:middle line:84%
walking this planet, this Earth,
this land staring at waves

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:27.445 align:middle line:90%
of water, wondering who we are.

00:10:27.445 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:84%
She said, feel the
light hitting the water.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.015 align:middle line:90%
Feel the silence.

00:10:37.015 --> 00:10:40.030 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the
silence of the water.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
In that silence, we have been
receiving all the messages

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.160 align:middle line:90%
from the entire world.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Very powerful messages
that were, who are we?

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And said, the question, this
place is filled with questions.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.385 align:middle line:84%
The question allows
you to create.

00:11:09.385 --> 00:11:14.150 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.065 align:middle line:90%
Be the question.

00:11:15.065 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, over the horizon,
the question came.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
She said, you think you
are here to bring answers.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
is to bring answers?

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't know.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:90%
It's to clarify things.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And she said, an answer
is the end of a path.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:90%
And life is a path.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So how would you
bring an answer?

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:90%
To end life or what?

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
She said, what you
have come here to do,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
if it's bringing consciousness
is not to bring answers.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:90%
It's to bring questions.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Because the only
thing that opens

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:84%
the mind is the
question, not the answer.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:90%
The answer stops everything.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
The universe was
made with questions.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So you are here to
bring consciousness

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.770 align:middle line:90%
on the question, not the answer.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was
very clarifying what

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:90%
she said in that moment.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, I allow myself
to be the question.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:90%
So I took the crystals.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And the woman said,
let me whisper it

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.480 align:middle line:84%
to the crystal with
all this information.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And she said something
like, the key

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.437 align:middle line:90%
is the question and wondering.

00:13:00.437 --> 00:13:04.253 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:13:07.925 --> 00:13:08.725 align:middle line:90%
The wisdom.

00:13:08.725 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.635 align:middle line:84%
Those who are the wise have
the answers in the skies.

00:13:15.635 --> 00:13:18.720 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.740 align:middle line:90%
To be so here with a question.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom is wonder.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:38.342 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.342 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
With that intention,

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
she gave the crystals to
the water in the right spot

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.945 align:middle line:90%
and spread along.

00:13:54.945 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
That's how we accomplished
this part of the path

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:84%
once we had done all this
tiny dragon's path within.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Having all the struggles to
not understanding what to do

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and then to acknowledge that
the answer was a question.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Now that the question was seeded
inside the egg of the dragon,

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:35.470 align:middle line:84%
the goal is to
spread this wondering

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:84%
for the awakening of
consciousness, which

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:90%
is something that we all have.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But we are so worried
about having answers.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Because this time is all
about, I need answers.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And what we are
not getting it is--

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:84%
what we are not getting is
that the question that is

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:90%
allowing the answers to appear.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's much more important
to make more questions

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.995 align:middle line:90%
than just to find the answers.

00:15:02.995 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So after this
path, we keep going

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:84%
to do more cleaning of the
energies and different tasks

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
that we are supposed
to do, going

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:24.680 align:middle line:84%
to Tierra del Fuego in Patagonia
for the eclipse and to Egypt.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have many
other tasks to do.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And it is like as
if the Earth is

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
a machine and
every different day

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:84%
we have something to
attach in the planet.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that is
not for a specific thing.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
thousands of people

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.850 align:middle line:84%
have been doing for
thousands of years.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.280 align:middle line:90%
It's like having a home.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.527 align:middle line:84%
You just don't
say, I have a home,

00:15:51.527 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:90%
and everything is perfect.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
You daily have to
clean it, daily

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.020 align:middle line:90%
have to repair some stuff.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that
we all have to do.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
always like this.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not to begin
something perfect.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.530 align:middle line:84%
It's to keep this house
a good place to live.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:84%
This path of the dragon
is part of my task

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:84%
to finish something in
February 2022 in Egypt.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
The region that actually
today is, Egypt for me,

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:84%
was the beginning of
everything that I am doing.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
My mission in this
planet started there

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:90%
by the Nile 12,000 years ago.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And according to what I
know, this February 2022

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
is the ending of a cycle
that finished for me.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It ends the whole path that I
have taken for 12,000 years.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.290 align:middle line:84%
After that, I'm going to be
ready to do a next step, which

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:09.851 align:middle line:84%
is not the activation
of the planet

00:17:09.851 --> 00:17:15.829 align:middle line:84%
and only with nature, but
also with the people, humans

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:90%
as we are.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:10%
So for me, connecting
in Egypt next year,

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:10%
2022, it's like the
end of a story for me.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And in March 2022,
I will be free to do

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:34.915 align:middle line:90%
my mission in this life.

00:17:34.915 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.170 align:middle line:10%
We started to open
this portal of energy.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.750 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly, I wasn't there.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:10%
And I was like
grabbed to the ground.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't even speak.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't do anything.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:10%
I was in a very horrible state.
