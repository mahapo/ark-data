00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:13.473 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.473 --> 00:00:27.944 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>> When I left Egypt, I was
supposed to do the whole path

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:84%
of the dragon following
the geographical path,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:84%
which starts in Norway
coming down through Ukraine

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and starting with the head
of the snake in Turkey.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:84%
From there I would go to
Armenia, Iran, Pakistan,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
up till Siberia, to Alaska,
Utah, Central America,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:90%
then to South America.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:10%
But when I was ready to do
that many other things happened

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:10%
that changed completely
the shape of the dragon

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:10%
because some countries
wouldn't allow me to get in.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:10%
And so I was kind of
worried about what am I

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:10%
supposed to do because
this part of the dragon

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.230 align:middle line:10%
is something that since 2017 was
telling me you have to do it,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:10%
you have to accomplish it.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And I had no clue what
they were referring to.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly I remember
something that

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:84%
was told to me the
first day that all

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:84%
my path around the
planet started,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:90%
which was February 7 in 2012.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I was in Montserrat,
Spain in this mountain.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of the
night with a full moon,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:90%
this Merlin appeared.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time I
felt him in my entire life.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Here you are
in front of the dragon you

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.510 align:middle line:90%
have to face."

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And the mountain has
this shape of a dragon

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:90%
with an eye in the center.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.150 align:middle line:90%
He said, "You have to think.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
If you are going to
face the dragon or you

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
are going to go
through the dragon."

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
This dragon has these two
eyes, one in the north;

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:90%
the other one in the south.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And these two eyes
of the dragon are

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:84%
connected by all the
body of the dragon

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
icosahedron of the planet

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:90%
and the spines of the mountains.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So every country
throughout the dragon

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
represents a special
spot of emotions

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.560 align:middle line:84%
that must be realigned
because they are separated

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:84%
or countries that are against
each other in conflicts.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So he said, "The
only way you can

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.888 align:middle line:84%
help Earth is if you
are there to face and go

00:02:49.888 --> 00:02:51.055 align:middle line:90%
through the dragons within."

00:02:51.055 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
During the path of
the I AM in Egypt,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I had to go through many
different processes alone.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And the last month in July, I
got into a very deep depression

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:90%
during the month of cancer.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It was like a very
deep process that I

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:84%
had to go to clean up
many of my inner things,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:84%
and also I was like
I'm alone in all this.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, everything,
the astrology,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and the guides
everyone were telling

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:90%
the next step will be together.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:84%
You need someone
else to accompany

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.930 align:middle line:84%
you to activate every one of
the chakras, mostly the heart.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So because the eyes
of the dragon are two,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and in order to see within,
you need to see other.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:90%
You cannot see only yourself.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.050 align:middle line:84%
This part for you,
for yourself needs

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:90%
to be done with someone aside.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I had no clue how it
was supposed to be.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that it would be
the first week of August,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:84%
which is the end
of the I AM path

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of the dragon.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Thiago came to one of the
trips that I was doing.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it was like if
we met from the whole life.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:10%
It got so normal that
we had to be together

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.710 align:middle line:10%
to do this, not only by me, but
the perception of the people

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:10%
around, it's never
been like that before,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:10%
like you are supposed
to do this together.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:10%
So during my birthday when
I was inside the pyramid

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:10%
and they gave me as a
gift this septarian stone,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:10%
the eyes of the dragon,
someone gave one to him

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:10%
too like the same one
saying, "You are the eyes.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you expand love through
your heart with these stones,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
will be spread everywhere
so the eyes of the dragon

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:90%
can be balanced."

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we decided
to do all these other six

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.252 align:middle line:90%
months together.

00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't usually think
much about the places

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
where I'm going because I
learned through all this time

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.640 align:middle line:84%
that the best way to connect
is not to expect anything

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:90%
in any place.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're trying
to control everything

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and you are not
going to be surprised

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:90%
by the signals in those spots.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So I am open to
anything, but I knew

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
that I had to start
in San Andreas Fault.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like unstable
territory of many energies

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that move with fear
and transformation.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So I had to start
there because we

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
needed to start in a place
that moves our ground.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So California is the
first spot that we

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:84%
went to but through
national parks that

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:90%
represent the process.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So the first process was
to go to Yosemite Park

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
because I needed to have
the data of the place,

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:90%
of all the territory.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And there you have the oldest
trees in North America.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
information of everything

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle line:90%
that happened in the last era.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So just walking by the
trees and feeling the trees,

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:84%
it was like an
invitation for me to say,

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:90%
I am here to do this work.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a presentation
before going to the mountains.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Then it was just going through
the Death Valley to face death

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.885 align:middle line:90%
and to just be nowhere.

00:06:51.885 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:10%
Then, even if it seems like
it doesn't make any sense,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.180 align:middle line:10%
we had to go through
Las Vegas, which

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.960 align:middle line:10%
is one of the deepest
and lowest energies

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:10%
in the whole continent.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So we had to face
these energies.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And of course, to connect
the soul, the spirit,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and the body in
Sedona in the portals

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
of Cathedral Rock, where you
could leave everything behind.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Then the Grand Canyon,
which is the memory.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:84%
You can awake the memory
through facing all the demons

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:90%
that you had before.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And then go to the
Monument Valley

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
to stand up again in the
sacred territory which

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:90%
is the Four Corners.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where once was
located the magnetic field.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And this territory
is a place of balance

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:84%
in between the main mountains
that are in each state.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So being inside of
it is like being

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
aligned between East,
West, North, South, and all

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.210 align:middle line:90%
the concepts of the universe.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:14.590 align:middle line:84%
After this, the high
points of Colorado.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:84%
During our path through
the Rocky Mountains,

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:90%
we did a stop in Gaia.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:90%
So I did a bunch of weird stuff.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.770 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was really empowering
because the event in GaiaSphere

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:84%
was like meeting many of the
people that were following

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:84%
everything that I was doing
and the path of the dragon

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and the path of
the I AM in Egypt.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So doing this alone
and being in silence,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
almost disappearing from every
social media and everything

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
during these weeks, and
finding all these people

00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:84%
willing to help to hold
all what I am doing

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:84%
was like very empowering
and helpful for the path.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And as I think what I say
is helpful for them, for me,

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:84%
the embrace of all this energy
was helpful to keep going.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment,
they said, you

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:84%
are able to go to the
egg of the dragon,

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
where all the information
for the potential

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:90%
is there, which is Utah.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Every salt flats in the
planet is like a library.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
The reason why they
are so important

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:84%
is because they have the
information from the oceans

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and also the information
from the high mountains.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.110 align:middle line:84%
This is because when the
tectonic plates they move,

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
other islands and
mountains are coming up.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
oceans get trapped

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the lands.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So when they get
dry, all the salt

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.150 align:middle line:90%
rests there, like a desert.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:84%
In the Americas, we have
two big salt deserts.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:10%
One in the North America, which
is where we are in Salt Lake.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
in Bolivia, Uyuni.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So both of them represent the
memory of these two continents,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
the mother in South
America and the father

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:84%
of North America
12,000 years ago

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:84%
this place was covered on ice,
and the magnetic North Pole

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.710 align:middle line:84%
was kind of located
in these regions.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
So all the memory
of 12,000 years ago

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.600 align:middle line:90%
were encoded in this territory.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:84%
When everything changed in
the pattern of the trip,

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I knew either way, that I had
to be here in this territory

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:84%
because we needed to align
our pass down of information

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
through the dragon
with the North Pole.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And what we are
doing this time is

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:14.950 align:middle line:84%
trying to heal this relationship
between South and North

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Pole, the feminine
and the masculine,

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:90%
trying to find this balance.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday when I
was going to sleep,

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I was just letting
my mind blank.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And I started to dream about
so many things that I--

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:84%
it's been a long time without
dreaming so many things.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:84%
First of all about
another planet.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And in that planet, there
were some tall beings,

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
like the Sirian people
that were like, "Oh, we

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.730 align:middle line:84%
have to show him where
we have to land and do

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:90%
something specific."

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:84%
They showed me this
territory and they show

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:90%
me a portal of four corners.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And they said the
4 corners should

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:84%
be honoring the four directions
of ancestors of each territory.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Then a fifth one in the center
and crossing from East, West,

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.520 align:middle line:90%
South, and North --

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:90%
four spheres.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:10%
And I just remember that I
had other four spheres that I

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.010 align:middle line:10%
was not supposed to have.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.700 align:middle line:84%
We charged these spheres
during the eclipse

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.390 align:middle line:84%
of the North Pole in Egypt
with all the information

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
from other levels
of consciousness,

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.010 align:middle line:84%
bringing all of that
inside the spheres

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:84%
so they could bring the
information through the water.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:10%
So four spheres and
one in the center,

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:10%
which is the one that
belongs to this territory.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:10%
So they said, "We will download
the information to that one

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.940 align:middle line:10%
being hoeld by the rest."

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So you just have to be there
standing, waiting for the three

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:90%
portals in the sun.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So when we came here, I knew
that the light of the sun

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:84%
was the opening
portal for connecting.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Usually, the sunrise
and the sunset

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:84%
are the best moments to
do a connection like this

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
because the energy
is pure and calm.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And the photons are
not moving everywhere,

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:84%
reflecting everywhere so
they are just going straight

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.760 align:middle line:90%
through the territory.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's better to
do something like this early.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So we were here before sunrise,
but I had no clue where to go,

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:90%
what to do.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Here, where this water that
was reflecting everything,

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of a
call to say you have

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:05.550 align:middle line:84%
to be walking in heaven so
you can be in both sides

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:90%
at the same moment.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So I start to figure
out where I have to go.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And this bird comes and
shows me exactly where I

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.160 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to locate myself.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So I went straight
there, and there

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
was like in the shape of
the cracks of the salt,

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:90%
it was like an eye.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, it's
this right here.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I took all the other
tools that I sometimes

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:84%
use in order to help me
open the portals when

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I am not knowing exactly
what to do with my hands.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:90%
So I used something external.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:84%
This tool reflects
every geometry,

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:84%
the 12 colors of the rainbow,
every pattern of the network.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So opening the doors between
dimensions and concepts.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:84%
The crystal to align
my chakras so I

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:84%
could be connected with
everything and align

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:84%
in every emotion and everything
so I could be neutral.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a tool
for that to be centered.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I had these geometries, the
main 5 geometries made up

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:90%
with a crystal from Mexico.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle line:10%
The geometrical
structures helped

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:10%
me to open each
one of the portals

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:10%
of the world and the reality,
which is the network and also

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:10%
the main patterns or
seeds of all the creation.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:10%
So whenever they
are there, they just

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:10%
multiply all the
geometry into whatever

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:10%
is reflecting that shape.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:10%
So, hexahedron, tetrahedron,
icosahedron, and dodecahedron

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:10%
on each corner representing
each one of the elements

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:10%
to each one of the doors
of the territories.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And in the center, the seed,
which is the octahedron.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And also I understood
that I was supposed

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:84%
to charge with all this
information into the crystal.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I put
everything inside the water

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:84%
so they could be charged during
the opening of the portal.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So when I located
everything where

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:84%
it was supposed to
be, someone said,

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.290 align:middle line:84%
now position yourself
in the center.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:84%
In that moment,
the sun rises so I

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:36.420 align:middle line:84%
could bring all the power of
light photons inside the portal

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.520 align:middle line:84%
so the connection
could be faster.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.920 align:middle line:84%
When I started to connect
and all the energy

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
that was needed for
the portal ended--

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:84%
--and in that
moment I was already

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.630 align:middle line:84%
connecting with one of those
beings that I saw in my dream

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.420 align:middle line:90%
in another world.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:30.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:84%
He started to talk to me
about this main great portal,

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:84%
this main door between four
continents, which is the portal

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:90%
that Mu people used to use.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
He told me to ask permission to
each one of the ancestors that

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:84%
are in this land,
the Native Americans

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:84%
not only from this continent
but mostly from this area,

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to ask permission to each
one of the directions.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So they could download the
information of where they

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.195 align:middle line:90%
were supposed to seed here.

00:18:10.195 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.785 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:18:17.785 --> 00:18:23.780 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So when this native spirit
said, "Now position yourself.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the old North Pole,
and used this information

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.720 align:middle line:84%
from this pole to
connect South and North

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and acknowledge that in
your cells," Thiago came up

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and we understood
that we were the two

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:84%
eyes that we have to
be in the opposites,

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:90%
so North Pole, South Pole.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So receive the
eyes of the dragon.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.790 align:middle line:84%
They said, "Wait for
the eyes to shine."

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the clouds there
was this eye opening

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of all the
clouds, and the sun just

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.680 align:middle line:90%
rises there again.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was reflected
in the water

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and you could see like
this head of a dragon

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.400 align:middle line:84%
with the two eyes
shining one on the South;

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:84%
the other one in the
North and a light shining

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:84%
in the center, which was
the core of the planet.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And you could see the
rays of the light going

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:84%
like opening to the ground,
and in the reflection

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:90%
it was closing down.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:90%
So it was the octahedraon.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And the magnetic field
of the planet, you

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:84%
could see every one of
the lines connecting

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:90%
like the magnetic field.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So that was the balancing for
us to be North and South as one

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:90%
and not separated.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:84%
It was like a recalibration
of these energies in order

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:84%
for us to balance them in the
new position of the new North.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And by doing this, we could be
opening this new information

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:17.190 align:middle line:84%
for Moon, Sun, North, South and
connecting the network again.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
that we just

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.080 align:middle line:84%
will represent for one
day, and then the task

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.320 align:middle line:84%
should be held by many
through consciousness.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So millions of people
should be aware of where

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.500 align:middle line:84%
is the new North, of
how to re-establish

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
the new North within
ourselves, outside,

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and to keep it as it is
today in going to the East

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:84%
so we could balance
ourselves into this new time,

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:84%
balance ourselves
into this new North.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%

a new civilization in balance

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.580 align:middle line:90%
tells me walk into the water.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.800 align:middle line:10%
It seems sand, but
you could sink in it.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.000 align:middle line:90%
