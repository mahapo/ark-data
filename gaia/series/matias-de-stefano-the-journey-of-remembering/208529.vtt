00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that
happened in the pyramid was

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
that they said there are two
things that you have to do,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:84%
the path of the dragon
and the path of the I am.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:84%
The path of the dragon would
be the connection between south

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and north -- north to south
through the mountain chains,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:84%
where the energy of Kundalini
flows through the planet.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So in 2016, I was
preparing the people

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.570 align:middle line:84%
to understand what is the
path of the dragon, what

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:84%
is the project of the I am,
understanding the whole network

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:10%
But I kind of lost it,
the goal of everything,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:10%
and I was creating a
team to do everything.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
the one doing this.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a group of
people that we go together.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
That people could see
that it's not about me,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
it's about many
others, and we can all

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:90%
do it together, and so on.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.120 align:middle line:84%
We decided to start this
dragon path in Antarctica,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and I took 72 people
to Antarctica.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
We rented an airplane to
go to Antarctica Peninsula

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
to do an activation,
which would be

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
to put all the energy from the
purest continent into crystal

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:90%
spheres that we brought there.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:90%
72 crystal spheres.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And within them, by singing,
we put all the energy

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
of the pure continent, the
consciousness of the planet,

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
so then we could
bring that information

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
along the planet in the
entire reach of the world.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
The first week that the
path of the dragon started,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother dies, and
I was doing the path.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So I kept with this
thought in my mind.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:10%
Am I doing a good
thing doing this path

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.220 align:middle line:10%
or I was supposed to be beside
her to help her transcend?

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I start to feel a bit
guilty of what I was doing.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I had no clue what I was doing
eventually in one moment,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and I decided to do an
Ayahuasca ceremony in Peru

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.470 align:middle line:84%
during the path to ask,
channel other dimensions

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:84%
because I was not
listening properly

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and I had no clue
what was happening.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So immediately when
I took the Ayahuasca,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
it was a voice saying,
let's start with this

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the questions that
the wise one in that space

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
said was, can you remind me
the name of your project?

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said I am,
and he said, so why

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
have you started a
path saying we are?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
know, because I

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be that person
that everyone looks to,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and he said oh,
that's a mistake,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:84%
he said because you were
designed to be looked at.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So you are hiding yourself
from your own responsibility,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and you are grabbing
people along the path

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:90%
just to hide yourself.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, whoa, OK.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:84%
That was a tough one, and
that's why people around you

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
are suffering because you're
using them to hide yourself

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
behind the we are
when we are not.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, OK, so he said,
you have to represent I am,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:90%
so you can only do it alone.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And I entered in this
crisis-- a very deep crisis--

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.445 align:middle line:90%
like, I don't know.

00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
I wanted to this.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It's too much responsibility
to be in front of this alone.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people staring at
me not knowing what to do,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and I started to feel that
I abandoned my family just

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.270 align:middle line:90%
because of weird stuff.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So I said, my grandmother died,
I was not there in that moment,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
so it was just
because of my mission.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.585 align:middle line:90%
I arrived to Mexico.

00:04:51.585 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:84%
When I arrived to Mexico, I
said, I can't do this anymore.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I can't fake that I am
doing something for humanity

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
if I couldn't do
something for my family.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But I was feeling something
that, way before someone

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
told me that, in order to
do this, you have to die.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I let myself die,
and basically, I just

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
turned off all the lights
of my magnetic field

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and let all the demons
come and kill me.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:84%
That was basically
what I just said.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Here I am, I'm switching off
all the shields, and kill me.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I said, I leave everything
in the hands of whoever.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I enter a
process of artistic reality

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.870 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't
speak with anyone,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:90%
I got in a very deep depression.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I was for a month
lost in Mexico.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Someone had to buy me a
ticket to send me back home,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:90%
but I was a bag.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:10%
I was nothing but just
flesh, and I came back home

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:10%
and they put me in bed,
and I was there for weeks.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Until I start to
hear my inner voice.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:84%
He told me, "You know
what you're doing?"

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said no, and he said, "You
are leaving your personality

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.550 align:middle line:90%
in control of everything.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.280 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
everything is failing

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:84%
is because you think Matias
is in charge of this,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:90%
and Matias is just a tool.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And you have to treat
Matias as a tool.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.300 align:middle line:90%
You are not you.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Who is you?

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Who are you really?"

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I am Ghan.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Ghan is my higher self.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So he said, so let
Ghan be in control

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:90%
of the tool, which is Matias.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:90%
So suddenly, I understood.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the personality
is something

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.970 align:middle line:84%
that the spirit creates in order
to be able to leave and to do

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle line:90%
what it is supposed to do.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to control
everything through my ego,

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
through my personality,
and everything

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.540 align:middle line:90%
was about I am, not me.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So I let away the
me, and I said,

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:84%
I accept Matias, the
personality, as a tool.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So here I am for anything you
are supposed to do with me.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what we have to do?

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
First of all is to position
yourself, again, in the center.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So I woke up, and I said, I'm
here for whatever is needed,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and that same day, people
start to call me to film,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:84%
to do stuff with me,
to tell my story,

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and that's how Gaia
contacted me, and here I am.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:10%
All that happened
that year was teaching

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.900 align:middle line:10%
me something important about
the path of the dragon.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:10%
I recognized that all that time
between the message of the I

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:10%
am and the end of
2017, which was

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:10%
the preparation for
the dragon was my path

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:10%
to try to clean up
all what I had within;

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:10%
to clean out many friends
relationships that I had.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Many thoughts that I had
connected to, all ideas.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:84%
When I did that, I saw
my own initiatic path.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:84%
You have to do this
and that and you

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:84%
have to face at least
three deaths in order

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:90%
to be really in the I am.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to die physically,
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:84%
They showed me a mountain that
I was supposed to go to die,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and I had no clue which
mountain was that,

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:90%
but the shape was familiar.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:90%
It was Mount Kailash in Tibet.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I did my first--

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I guess my first initiatic path
in Egypt with Gaian people,

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and when I finished
the path, everyone

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:90%
said, now, where'll you go?

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well now it's my
turn to do my own iniatic path,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to Tibet to die
and everyone was like, what?

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:90%
How is that?

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:90%
How is that?

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I have no idea.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.095 align:middle line:90%
So I would go.

00:09:32.095 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:84%
They told me to go to die,
but I don't think I would die,

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:90%
but anyway, I would go anyway.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Tibet
right after Egypt,

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and it was very
difficult to get there.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Airplanes canceled, going
on a truck, and all this

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:84%
to reach Kailash, and also,
there is something important

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.600 align:middle line:84%
that I had no clue
about Mount Kailash;

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
that it's sacred for at
least three religions,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and there is something that
they call the Kora path, which

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:84%
is you have to go clockwise
around the mountain

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:84%
to honor the heavens and
Shiva, who is the God

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:90%
living in the mountain.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:84%
But I had specific
instructions that I

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:84%
had to do the path
anti-clockwise, like going

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.550 align:middle line:84%
down, and that's
forbidden in that land.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Nobody does it, because
it's like going to hell.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
But I said, no, my
instructions are this.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And until the very last
day, I had to do everything

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to convince someone to
accompany me to do the path

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
anticlockwise,
because I was trying

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the core
of the planet, not heaven.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, no, no,
there is only a few people that

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:90%
do that, and I say, who?

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And they are the original
people from the territory that

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
had the tradition to
do it that direction

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
because they are not from
the main religions that

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:90%
believe in Shiva.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:90%
They are believing in nature.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.940 align:middle line:90%
So I said, I want to do that.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So this guy said, OK,
I will risk my soul,

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:90%
but I will bring you.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So I said OK, I will talk
good about you when I die.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So he accompanied me very
worried during this whole path,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.920 align:middle line:90%
and it's really high altitude.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:10%
It's like 6,000 meters, and
I've never been so high walking.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:10%
And during this path, when I
started to do my first steps,

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:10%
suddenly, I felt a guide--

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.280 align:middle line:10%
let's say a Merlin aside me.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I say a Merlin, because everyone
knows Merlin the magician,

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
but Merlin was like an
order of Celtic people,

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and they were the high
priests of the Celtic culture.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So there were many
Merlins, not only one.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And this Merlin comes aside me,
and I had no clue why someone

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:84%
from the Celtic
culture would be --

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:84%
or druid culture --
would be there in Tibet.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But he would walk
aside me making

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
me go to my deepest darkness,
emotions and everything.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:84%
He would say to me that all
that I had to do in this path

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
was to die and I had
to practice that,

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:84%
so he was he was
accompanying me in the path

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
as if I was in a hospital
waiting for death.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And every step that
I gave was like, what

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:90%
are you leaving behind?

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:84%
What would you say to your
mother, what would you

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:84%
say to your grandmother,
what would you say

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:90%
to everyone if you die today?

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:84%
He made me write letters to
each one of them in the path

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and made me cry and
understanding how

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
every person is like
the rock in this path,

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and so many teachings
that he was telling me

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:84%
as we spoke it was like
being with a psychiatrist,

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.185 align:middle line:84%
psychologist going
through the mountain.

00:13:26.185 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.350 --> 00:14:02.010 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:08.620 align:middle line:10%
In that pass, you reach almost
7,000 meters above sea level,

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:10%
and I was just dressed up for--

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, winter in New
York or no, even in Georgia.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, some tiny
clothes, and that's it.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Not much, but people were really
dressed, because you could die.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:84%
The guide was always asking
me, are you headache?

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Are you headache?

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Because you can have a stroke.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, I've
no headache, but I was.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:84%
But I had to die,
so I don't care.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it was a signal,
and that night I got to sleep

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and in the morning when I
woke up with a headache,

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I saw Merlin here in front of
me saying, are you ready to die?

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Because it's today.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, my gosh.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, and
suddenly, the guide

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:84%
enters the tent where we
were sleeping and says,

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:90%
are you headache?

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said no, and he
said, because a Russian guy

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:84%
was crossing and just died
because he couldn't make it.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.980 align:middle line:84%
He had a stroke, and
they are taking him down.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, oh, my God.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.060 align:middle line:90%
That's a sign.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.953 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to take it.

00:15:27.953 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:90%
So I said, no, I will do it.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:90%
I can do it.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.620 align:middle line:90%
So I started to--

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:84%
that day with the
snow on my face.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:90%
I suddenly reached a point.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I sat down and I
had my hands blue

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.700 align:middle line:90%
and my feet blue, everything.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I had water that was freezing
inside my shoes, and I said,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, I cannot walk anymore.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:90%
I had a headache.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I sat down to take
a breath, and when I looked up,

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:84%
just a tiny circle
of clouds opened

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and you could see the highest
point of the mountain.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time that
I saw it, and when I saw it,

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:84%
the sun was shining
right there, and you

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
could see the light
shining towards us

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.860 align:middle line:84%
from the top of
the mountain, and I

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:84%
saw this tunnel of
light coming to me

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and I felt like I was
dying, and suddenly, I

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:84%
felt like the top of the
mountain was a triangle

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
but it was someone
meditating, coming

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:84%
to me that divided into so
many fractals like a mandala.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And all around,
this path of light

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:84%
was like different
tetrahedrons all around,

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.830 align:middle line:84%
but actually, they were
all masters meditating.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
But I could see that
tetrahedrons and the masters

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:84%
all at the same
time, and I could

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle line:84%
hear them meditating
with the sounds

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and singing and
spinning around, and I

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.579 align:middle line:84%
was like just in
the same position

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:90%
like going there and dying.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, everyone
was saying I am,

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I am, I am, I am,
I am, and there

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
was someone in the
mountain saying I am

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and telling me to say
that, I am, and he said,

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:90%
there is not many masters.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
There is only one, which is the
I am, and we all remember it.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So just say it and you
will be able to die.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:90%
So I started to say, I am.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:90%
I am every master.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:90%
I am, I am.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So when I did that, the
master in front of me said,

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:90%
you did it.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:48.490 align:middle line:90%
You died.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I was dead, and I
heard the voice, you did it.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:90%
You did it.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
voice of the master

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
became the guide, the shepa
that was with me, saying,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.200 align:middle line:90%
you did it.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:90%
You survived.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was his voice telling me,
hey, you did it, and I like--

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:84%
like that in the
meditation position.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.030 align:middle line:90%
And you did it.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.130 align:middle line:84%
You crossed the Dolma
La Pass, and you

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:84%
could see the mountain the
other side of the clouds.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And after that point,
it was going down.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:90%
So I had no clue.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I thought I died
there, and I really

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:84%
felt my body not working anymore
and everything shutting off.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Then Merlin appears again when
I came back and said, perfect.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:90%
You died.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:84%
So you-- actually
in a British accent

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:84%
he's like, perfect,
you have died,

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.480 align:middle line:90%
and you are ready to keep going.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:90%
And I said, keep going what?

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'll wait for
you in seven days in England,

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.100 align:middle line:90%
and I said, what?

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:10%
So I flew to England from
Tibet, and I arrived there

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.910 align:middle line:10%
and he said, I will wait for
you in the end of all lands.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.430 align:middle line:10%
And I said end of all
lands, so I looked for it

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:10%
and there's a place
called Land's End,

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:10%
so I said, OK, I will
go there in Cornwall.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:22.030 align:middle line:10%
So I went there, and
when I reached that spot,

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:10%
the spirit was waiting for me
there in that hill and said,

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.650 align:middle line:10%
look in front of this place.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, you have to
finish your soul here.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So your soul has to
die in this place.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK,
and he said so I'll

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
wait for you on the
other side of the island.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
I'll wait for you in the other
side of the island in Scotland.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Go to every stone
circle in the path

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and show me what
you're capable of

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and just disappeared
and left me alone.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And the only
instruction that he said

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:84%
was the first circle
you have to be naked.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:10%
So OK, so I went
to the stone circle

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.020 align:middle line:10%
and I looked around
if there was anybody

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.050 align:middle line:10%
and I got naked in the
center of the circle,

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:10%
and I saw how every
one of the stones

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:10%
were like someone judging me.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Every person that judged me
in my life, like the stones,

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and I had to be naked
there, saying, I don't care.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not important.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:33.835 align:middle line:90%
It's just flesh.

00:20:33.835 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So I had to face all
my emotional fears

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
also regarding my
ego, and so I did.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I started all this
path through every stone circle

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:84%
in England and Scotland going
through each one of them,

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and in every one of
them, I knew that I

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:01.360 align:middle line:84%
had to do some task,
some preparation.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:10%
Merlin, he said,
cross to the island --

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:10%
Orkney Islands in the North --

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:13.280 align:middle line:10%
and there, you'll see the crown
and the crown of this land.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you are there, prepare
to die, again, with your soul.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So I took a boat
across to the island,

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and I had no clue what
I would find there.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.685 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there was
this last stone circle.

00:21:29.685 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.900 align:middle line:90%
This beautiful stone circle.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Nobody goes there.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:90%
It's so special.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.735 align:middle line:84%
It was all green around
but inside was red.

00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.590 align:middle line:10%
It looked like a crown.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:10%
It looked so beautiful,
and I went to the stones,

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.310 align:middle line:10%
and I put my chest aside
of one of the stones,

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.980 align:middle line:10%
like if each one of the
stones were a person,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:10%
and I felt part of that circle.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And I heard a voice in
between the stones saying,

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:84%
we are here to watch you, and
I said, so where do I belong?

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.050 align:middle line:90%
And they said in the center.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So that moment maybe was
something easy for some people,

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:84%
but for me it was really
tough, because that

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.760 align:middle line:84%
was the moment of
the decision that I

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:84%
had to take saying my place
is to be in the center.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Seen by others, not aside the
others and at least for now,

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:84%
my mission is to be seen
and to be in the center.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to walk
to the center of the stones

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and I got to the middle
of it, and suddenly, I

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:84%
accepted that I had
to be in the center.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:90%
So I am the center.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
stones started to say

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:90%
every circle has a center.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Without a center,
there is no circle.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Without a circle,
there's no center.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So you are never alone, and
your work is with the team,

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:90%
but the team is to surround you.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:84%
The team is to hold
everything to be a sphere

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:90%
and you mark the center.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go?

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:84%
When I said this, something
in me started to see every one

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:84%
of my lives and every one of the
stones became each one of me --

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:90%
of myself -- staring at me.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.660 align:middle line:90%
Not other people.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:51.160 align:middle line:84%
It was just my soul
watching me, and every stone

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:90%
was one of my lives.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And I saw all of them, and
they started to come to me

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and becoming me and
saying, we are the circle

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:90%
that holds who you are.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So don't expect for others
to be in that circle.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
We are that circle that
puts you in the center.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So it was very healing
that moment in which

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:23.860 align:middle line:84%
my soul let itself
die from all the way

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that it was waiting for being
in the center for other people.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Like the responsibility of being
seen by others, but they said,

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:37.090 align:middle line:84%
the only ones from
which you have

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:41.620 align:middle line:84%
to feel that you are being seen
is ourselves, which is yourself

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:90%
in different timelines.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And that moment was like
Merlin saying you can go home.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Like, OK, that's it.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So these two paths took
me to the understanding

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:84%
of so many things that I had
to face for myself in order

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:90%
to be who I am today.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what allowed me after
that to be in front of a camera

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:17.080 align:middle line:84%
to tell any story, to tell
anything and not being

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:23.290 align:middle line:84%
afraid of being seen by many
and being the image of more

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:84%
people or guiding any
path, because I now

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.990 align:middle line:84%
know that it's not my
responsibility that others

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.530 align:middle line:84%
see me, it's my
responsibility to see myself.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:90%

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.870 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, I just
turned back to them,

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:10%
and I did like this,
and two birds--

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:10%
ibis, the Thoth birds--

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:10%
flew from me from behind, and
it was like, what is happening?

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Something weird was happening.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.190 align:middle line:90%
