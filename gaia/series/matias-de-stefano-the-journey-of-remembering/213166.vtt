00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.320 align:middle line:10%
>> In Great Britain, the
Stonehenge circle is one

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:10%
of the most important ones,
because it's the only one here

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:10%
in Britain that has the
structure of like roofs

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.210 align:middle line:10%
of stones, which means that it
was the main ceremonial center

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:10%
for all the region,
England and Scotland.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.060 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge represents
the root chakra,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:84%
is the source of energy
of the entire island,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.090 align:middle line:84%
is the place where all
the people got together

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.400 align:middle line:84%
to sow their seeds for the
power of the circle to push it

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.140 align:middle line:90%
like the Kundalini going up.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So from the seed in Stonehenge,
the power of information

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:90%
would go to the womb in Avery.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And from there, would
go to the plexus

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.805 align:middle line:84%
to be recognized in nine ladies
and the center of Britain.

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge is a very
important ceremonial center,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:84%
even though it's broken
today and most of the stones

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.610 align:middle line:84%
have been used for building
houses in the Middle Ages.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So most of the huge stone
circle has been lost.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Today we can only
see some few stones,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
but actually the circle
was huge and very big.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
the stone circle

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.650 align:middle line:84%
was like one to two
kilometers around.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.710 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge ceremonial space
for solstices and equinoxes,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and it had many circles
going to the center.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So the most important one
is the remaining stones

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:90%
that you can see today.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
But the information of the
stones has been broken,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.245 align:middle line:90%
so it's not exactly the same.

00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:84%
You can still go
and feel the place

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and connect with the
place, and somehow

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
perceive the information that
the previous constructors

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.450 align:middle line:84%
of this place were aiming to
reach through the sunrise,

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.200 align:middle line:84%
the sun sets in every
equinox and every solstice.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:10%
The first time that I went to
Stonehenge, I connected to one

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.630 align:middle line:10%
of the stones, which is the one
that marks the summer solstice.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I immediately connected
with that stone.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And I went there and the spirit
of the stone was telling me,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:84%
here is where the
seats are lying.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Here is where you
empower your path.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk
by that stone, it's

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
like if you are in the
center of the circle,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's the line that marks
where the energy is entering

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:90%
the circle.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So every time that I go there, I
usually go first to that stone,

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%
so I can connect with
the center of Stonehenge

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.115 align:middle line:90%
and then walk around.

00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
This time when we went in,
we divided the group in two.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And I asked for permission
to the guardians.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.740 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:84%
We asked permission
to the Guardians

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%
of this land of
the circle to unify

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
the two sides of a heart cut by
a wound to unify it into a seed.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And I open myself to receive
the information and the energy

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:90%
of this land through my feet.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It goes all through my
body towards my crown.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And I become aware of the circle
that I am within the circle.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I allow myself to go
deep inside this land.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.990 align:middle line:90%
The idea was to open our wounds.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The main wounds that have
been created in our bodies,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
in our memories, in our
souls, and to look for them.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So we could open
them and release

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.680 align:middle line:90%
the tension of that wound.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Because this is an initiatic
path for the people that

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:84%
is walking through,
the idea was for them

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
to do that for themselves,
not for humanity.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:10%
The idea was for them to
connect with their own wounds,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:10%
with their personal
path, and to find,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:10%
where was the key that made them
start all these paths to try

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.100 align:middle line:10%
to find themselves?

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:90%
A merlin came.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:84%
He lead us into this
activation in the shape

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
of a circle in which we have to
go inside of our own process,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:84%
go within our first
wounds, and to take it out.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>> [VOCALIZING]

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>> The unspoken word.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
The power of the words
that you have not said

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:84%
are sometimes stronger
than those that we speak.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
For the main limitation
that you have created

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.965 align:middle line:84%
is your own word
and your own belief.

00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.350 --> 00:07:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Your wound is your forgotten
state of constant freedom

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
for you have created your
own jail, your own box

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.086 align:middle line:90%
through conditions.

00:07:09.086 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.205 align:middle line:84%
It is inside your conditions
where you find the wind.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:29.663 align:middle line:84%
And that first wound,
it's the word I cannot.

00:07:29.663 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Usually, we get traumatized
and we close our energy.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was to go
there, recognize that wound,

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and open it so the
blood from that wound

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:84%
would become the seed
of the new things

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.255 align:middle line:84%
that we want to
create for our lives.

00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:58.840 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Find your own personal treaty
where you have settled your own

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:90%
limits.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.215 align:middle line:90%
Where is it stuck in your tree?

00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:16.590 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.700 align:middle line:90%
It is your rotten apple.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It is stuck in the idea of
something that you are not able

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:84%
of, something that
you cannot tolerate.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.694 align:middle line:90%
It's stuck in your own belief.

00:08:41.694 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:90%
What is your rotten apple?

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.570 --> 00:09:00.835 align:middle line:84%
It is way hidden in
every part of your body.

00:09:00.835 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.535 align:middle line:90%
Look for it.

00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the wound that you
have come here to try to heal.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The first wound is when
we say, I can't, I cannot.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So he said, when you
say I cannot do this,

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tolerate this, I
cannot see, I cannot feel,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
when you say this
word all the time,

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
you are given the
power to others.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And usually, we gave the power
to others when we needed someone

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
to lead us, when we create
the idea that I cannot see.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So I need someone to
lead me that can see.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:90%
I cannot feel.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So I need someone to
tell me what to feel.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I cannot understand, so I need
someone to make me believe.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:84%
So this concept of I cannot is
the first wound that creates

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.805 align:middle line:90%
dependence on everyone else.

00:10:18.805 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The condition is what
you have come here to find

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.420 align:middle line:90%
and deliver.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.490 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
For your main work in this
life is to become free.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:52.654 align:middle line:84%
Your path is to
become unconditional,

00:10:52.654 --> 00:10:58.645 align:middle line:84%
to have a deal
with your own self,

00:10:58.645 --> 00:11:09.300 align:middle line:84%
to make a deal with your
own soul, and to say I can.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.163 align:middle line:84%
Love is the eternal energy
that connects all creation.

00:11:16.163 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:19.805 align:middle line:90%
And it's free.

00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:90%
For he does not have conditions.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Those conditions you
set are your only limit

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:84%
towards the
unconditional love, which

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:84%
is the seed you have
come here to sow.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.075 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.075 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
To release the tree
of unconditional love,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:01.366 align:middle line:84%
you have to sow the
seed of your condition.

00:12:01.366 --> 00:12:05.390 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.266 align:middle line:90%
Find your condition.

00:12:07.266 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:20.033 align:middle line:84%
Search for it, and expand it to
the ground through your singing.

00:12:20.033 --> 00:12:23.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Give the seed of
conditions to the soil.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So he was saying, search for
the first wound you remember,

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and take it out from that
wound in your soul and sow it

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So that seed could
become the protector

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and the energy of
the tree you are

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:90%
willing to create in your life.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the explanations
that he said to us

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:15.040 align:middle line:84%
is that every seed is covered
in a kind of a poison.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So it protects the power
of the tree inside.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:84%
The idea of this
is to understand

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that in order for us
to sow something new,

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:84%
to create the medicine of a
new tree, to expand ourselves,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:35.530 align:middle line:84%
we have to use our poison, which
are our wounds, our traumas

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:84%
in order to create
something new.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So by searching that,
by understanding

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:84%
the core of
everything, we would be

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
able to use that low
frequency that we relate

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:90%
to something bad into a seed.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The way you turn condition
into unconditioned is

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:84%
by switching the sentence of
I cannot towards a new one,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.530 align:middle line:90%
which is I can.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Think of the sentence
you may change

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.216 align:middle line:84%
to turn the poison
into medicine.

00:14:27.216 --> 00:14:29.790 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So he said in order
to heal that wound,

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.860 align:middle line:84%
find when was the first
time you say I cannot?

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And then turn around and
switch it into I can.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:90%
But I can something new.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.070 align:middle line:90%
I can tolerate.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:90%
I can expand.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:90%
I can understand.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:90%
I can, and so on.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>> And close the circle.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Deliver it to the circle.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.985 align:middle line:84%
This is your gift
and your freedom.

00:15:24.985 --> 00:15:28.360 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Open your eyes to
your new reality

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and expand your voice to
this new power of yours.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Expand your hearts,
looking up to the skies

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:90%
and releasing your new power.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So he made us do this
psychomagical act of turning

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:84%
the poison into medicine
by delivering the I cannot

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and switching ourselves into
the positive to say I can do

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And he was leading us into
this change of polarity, which

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:84%
is something that usually
happens in the mother cells

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
when the spermatozoid
enters the body.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
The egg of the
feminine body usually

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:47.900 align:middle line:84%
has the polarity outside,
calling through magnetism

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.650 align:middle line:90%
the spermatozoid.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And when one of
them gets inside,

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:90%
the circle changes polarity.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:90%
So it repels all the others.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what
he was making us

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.790 align:middle line:84%
do in a circle was
kind of that, saying

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:84%
there is something new waiting
for you to receive a seed.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.270 align:middle line:84%
So in order for
the seed to enter,

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
you need to open
yourself, open the wound.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you got the seed,
you change the polarity.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:84%
So the egg can receive
the new information.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.960 align:middle line:84%
When we change the polarity of
the cell that we were creating

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:38.230 align:middle line:84%
there, sowing the seed, creating
the womb, creating the egg,

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people when they
realize that they haven't said I

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
can and they were only saying I
cannot or I don't, usually they

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:90%
start to break.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Emotion starts to come,
cry, and sometimes they

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:90%
don't even know why.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.110 align:middle line:84%
But is the body recognizing that
something is changing inside.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Take a deep breath and
go back to your heart.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Honor the guardians
of this land.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Honor the ancestors
in this circle.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.605 align:middle line:90%
I honor those who dare.

00:18:43.605 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I honor the lost
souls willing to find.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> That act of magic of your own
self activating the alchemy that

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
you have inside, from the
darkness to the light,

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:84%
when we do it for ourselves,
we are also doing it for all

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:90%
our ancestors.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And because eventually, as
further we go in the past,

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:22.260 align:middle line:84%
we find the same wounds, because
we all share the same ancestors.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:90%
You reach the whole of humanity.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when you go
through your own process,

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:84%
you reach the
process of everyone.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>> You may now leave.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.015 align:middle line:90%
You may now leave.

00:19:45.015 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>> This gives the power
back to ourselves.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why in order to
do that, to assimilate

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:84%
the power in oneself,
the next step

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:84%
was Nine Ladies, which
is the first part

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.075 align:middle line:90%
of the ego, the feminine ego.

00:20:13.075 --> 00:20:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:84%
When I was guided by
Merlin, Nine Ladies

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:84%
was part of that enchanted path,
and I felt this feminine power

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I felt
this is part of a path

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:84%
that I have to do
something with this.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I started to
bring people to this circle.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:90%
