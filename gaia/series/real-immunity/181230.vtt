00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I studied homeopathy.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:10%
And to my amazement, I found
that homeopathy actually

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:10%
offered something as an option
to orthodox vaccination--

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:10%
in other words, a
form of immunization.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.230 align:middle line:90%
We call it now homeoprophylaxis.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
really decided to make

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:90%
that my main focus in clinic.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:90%
So I started practicing in 1984.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And by 1985, I designed
a program to be used

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:84%
by Australian parents-- because,
of course, I'm in Australia--

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:84%
as an option for them instead
of the orthodox vaccination

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.120 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And of course, things
have developed since then.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:10%
Not only has this been my main
focus in my professional life,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.450 align:middle line:10%
but I've been in
touch over the years

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:10%
with literally tens of
thousands of families

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:10%
who are making decisions.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:10%
And to be honest with
you, especially these days

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:10%
but even 30 years ago,
the decision whether

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:10%
or not to vaccinate,
whether to use some option,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:10%
is one of the hardest decisions
new parents have to make.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course, we
know, especially now,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:84%
the overwhelming amount
of promotion, advertising,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and pressure from all areas
within orthodox medicine,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and from politicians and from
the community in general,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:90%
for people to vaccinate.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So I really have seen many,
many people agonize over

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:90%
this decision.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have
decided to vaccinate,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and some have decided
to use homeoprophylaxis.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.760 align:middle line:84%
My own view is that
I'm there to be

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:84%
a person who gives
them options, who

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:90%
gives them factual information.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the main
things in this whole debate

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:90%
is the absence of simple truths.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole lot of
information out there

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.560 align:middle line:84%
which is not accurate,
which is not evidence-based

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:84%
even though there are
claims that it is.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And for parents to
have simple truths

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:84%
about safety and effectiveness
of both vaccination

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:84%
and homeoprophylaxis, to me,
is the most important thing

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:84%
that I can do-- hence, all
the research I've done from,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:90%
really, 1985 onwards.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.732 align:middle line:10%
>> The distinction between
homeoprophylaxis and vaccines--

00:03:22.732 --> 00:03:24.440 align:middle line:10%
because they start
from the same premise.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:10%
They start from using
the disease product--

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.950 align:middle line:10%
is a number of things.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:90%
One, attenuation.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:90%
And attenuation means to weaken.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So vaccines are attenuated
to a certain point,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
but there's still
a pathogen present.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Homeoprophylaxis is
attenuated until there

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
are no molecules of the
original substance at all.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So you've rendered it
an energetic frequency.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like downloading
information from the universe.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:84%
You're downloading information
instead of introducing

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.776 align:middle line:90%
something that's material.

00:03:55.776 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Another difference is the
route of introduction.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Vaccines are introduced
with a needle,

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:84%
so they're injected
directly into the system.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Mother nature does not impart
disease in that fashion.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Mother nature gives disease
through mucous membrane.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:90%
We breathe something in.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:90%
We eat something.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And homeoprophylaxis is on a
pellet that's put in the mouth

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:84%
so that it's being introduced
to the mucous membrane.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Another difference is the
additives that are in vaccines.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Vaccines are grown on mediums.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Frequently, they're animal
mediums, monkey's kidneys.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.900 align:middle line:90%
They have casing.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.190 align:middle line:84%
They have-- even on
human diploid tissue,

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:90%
on aborted fetal tissue.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And those tissues
of other life forms

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
carry viruses and
things that are unknown.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So you are taking
that into your system.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:90%
It's becoming part of your DNA.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
If you get a vaccine that's
been grown on a monkey kidney,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
then that DNA is becoming
part of your system.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Also, there are
different excipients.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:90%
There's preservatives.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:90%
There's antibiotics.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's adjuvants
in vaccines.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And adjuvants are designed
to boost the response

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
to the vaccine so that it
will create antibodies.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And homeoprophylaxis
has none of these

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
because homeoprophylaxis
doesn't aim

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:90%
to just increase antibodies.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:84%
It's addressing the immune
system in a balanced way

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
so that it's addressing both
innate and adaptive arms

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.465 align:middle line:84%
of the immune system, giving
overall long-term health

00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:39.265 align:middle line:90%
benefits.

now for, I think, 20 years.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.760 align:middle line:10%
I'm graduated as a
homeopath for 20 years now.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:10%
And first, I did it together
with my other job as a lawyer.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And after some years,
I thought, OK, I

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:90%
have to focus on homeopathy.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And I quit my job as a lawyer,
and I only was a homeopath.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:84%
But because you're a lawyer,
professional organization,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:84%
the [INAUDIBLE]---- this is
the profession of the Dutch

were very interested to have

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:90%
somebody in their board.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:90%
So I did that for 10 years.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And for nine years, I was
the representative for them,

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:90%
for the ECCH.

classical council.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:90%
I had a small practice.

met Isaac Golden on a congress.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was about
homeopathic prophylaxis.

And what he told me
and the way he told me

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%

inspired me, I thought,

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:84%

What are you doing?

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them,
well, it's going

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:90%
for both boys.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.940 align:middle line:84%
When I give HP, it gives
me a wonderful opportunity

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to get to know the individual
beauty of their immune systems.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I give a nosode.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I watch.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:90%
I listen.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:10%
I notice what's coming up.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:84%
How is their body
uniquely working with it?

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:10%
I've actually had
the pleasant surprise

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:10%
of seeing a developmental jump.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
After I gave a
particular nosode,

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I saw, within 48 hours,
a change in which--

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.040 align:middle line:90%
it was the younger one.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle line:84%
He was on the precipice
of learning to crawl.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
He would do this
funny crawl where

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
he would hook one leg a little,
and so he would hobble along

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.490 align:middle line:90%
with one knee.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:10%
And I remember I had given
him a particular nosode.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:10%
He'd had an extra long nap.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.457 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't thinking
anything of it.

00:10:05.457 --> 00:10:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, the next
time he was trying to crawl,

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
he had more readily
straightened that leg

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and was doing the motions
that he needed to.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.510 align:middle line:10%
And I was like, no,
that couldn't be.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Could that really be what I've
heard about with HP, that there

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:84%
could be this kind
of developmental leap

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
as if he actually had the
positive ramifications

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:90%
of that disease?

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, being
the energetic disease.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.650 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten to see
that in both of them.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:10%
In the older one, because
he started HP later

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:10%
than the younger one did, I
got to see an older child's

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:10%
developmental leap, like
a deepening of language.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.780 align:middle line:84%
He was at that stage where he
was learning more language.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost as if he
spoke more proficiently and more

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:90%
thoughtfully.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised to hear
what he came up with.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.904 align:middle line:84%
I was like, is this
that other type

00:10:59.904 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:90%
of developmental-- you know.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:10%
So it's given me an opportunity
to notice, to really notice

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:10%
them in their unique ways.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.894 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:10.894 --> 00:11:21.230 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:10%
>> It started when I was
pregnant and my physician

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.050 align:middle line:10%
recommended that I get the
whopping cough vaccine.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:84%
I was concerned about putting
something into my body

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:84%
while I was pregnant,
so I researched it.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:84%
I had them show me the insert
for the specific vaccine.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:84%
I looked online,
and I saw that there

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.850 align:middle line:84%
were no studies showing
that it was actually

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:90%
safe for pregnant women.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked a
bunch of friends,

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't get
positive results.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I decided to use
HP after I looked

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:90%
into vaccines while pregnant.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:90%
My physician recommended it.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:84%
I had them look at
the insert and tell me

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.801 align:middle line:90%
what kind of vaccine it was.

00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And there were no studies
showing that it was actually

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:90%
safe for pregnant women.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle line:84%
It said it was never
tested on pregnant women.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So that made me
look into vaccines,

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that it
wasn't a safe option.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a gambler.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like giving
my child vaccines

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:84%
was a gamble because
she could be fine,

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:84%
but she could have detrimental
side effects, even death.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't willing to do that.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.340 align:middle line:90%
I then looked into HP.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I contacted somebody
about HP, and she gave me

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:84%
tons of studies, said it
was safe and effective.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that was
enough to choose HP.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:84%
My husband was pretty
supportive, thankfully.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:84%
He trusted that I was making
the choice diligently.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just because I wanted
to do something different.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of time,
energy, and research to it.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.540 align:middle line:84%
My mom, who I'm really close
with, was really supportive.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:90%
My physician was not supportive.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.560 align:middle line:90%
I asked him.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:84%
I asked the midwife
at the hospital,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and they both said that there
were no studies on it, which

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:90%
turned out not to be true.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.304 align:middle line:84%
That led me to go
to a different--

00:13:13.304 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
I went to a birthing center
instead of the hospital,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and it was much
better received there.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:10%
>> We know, because of the way
that homeopathic medicines are

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:10%
made through a process of
dilution and succussion.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
both, they don't work.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
We know that there
are no toxic elements

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:90%
in the medicines themselves.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
with, for example,

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:84%
pertussin, which is the
remedy for whooping cough,

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:84%
we know that there are no
molecules of whooping cough

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:90%
organism in that remedy.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So the person can't
get the disease,

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.650 align:middle line:90%
and they can't shed it.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:84%
They can't pass it
on to other people.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And also, we know that
there is no aluminum.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.210 align:middle line:90%
There's no formaldehyde.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:84%
There's none of
the other materials

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:90%
that are in common vaccines.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the
remedies themselves

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
are very safe in the
sense of being non-toxic.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:84%
What we don't know
necessarily is effectiveness,

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
because there's no point
in having something safe

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:90%
if it doesn't work.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where the
focus of my research

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.000 align:middle line:84%
has been based, collecting
evidence from around the world

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
as to the effectiveness of
homeopathic immunization

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:90%
or homeoprophylaxis.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And to summarize
it, what we find

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:84%
is an effectiveness of
around the 90% mark.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:84%
It ranges between about 75% to
95%, but around the 90% mark.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:10%
>> For me, an
immune system has--

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:10%
it's very complicated.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It has several ways how
they can protect the body.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways
is via vaccination.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It gives some chemical
reactions that gives

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:90%
an antidote for a disease.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:90%
That's vaccination.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But the vaccine contains
several dangerous materials,

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and that can harm
a child as well.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:10%
A homeopathic prophylaxis
uses homeopathic remedies.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:10%
And what do I see when I
give a homeopathic remedy?

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:84%
What do I see when I give
a homeopathic prophylaxis?

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the same,
the same reaction.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle line:84%
The body accepted it and
respond in, hm, that's good.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.650 align:middle line:90%
I want to get rid of my--

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:90%
and whatever it is.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you see
a little sweaty,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:84%
or you see some diarrhea,
or you see some nose drops.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Or where you have a
child with ear problems,

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:84%
you see something
out of his ear.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's way how the
body's cleaning itself.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.700 align:middle line:90%
That is what I see with HP.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:84%
That is what I see
when I give the remedy.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, when you give the
remedy and they get a disease,

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:84%
then you see that the disease
is very mild, very mild.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So you recognize the symptoms,
but you don't see any harm.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't see high
fevers, or you don't see

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:90%
very much itching, or whatever.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.688 align:middle line:90%

>> Her health has been amazing.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I think she got a cold
once for a couple of days.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.310 align:middle line:84%
She's had a diaper
rash, and that's it.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:90%
No ear infections, no nothing.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.788 align:middle line:90%
She's ridiculously healthy.

00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
Everybody that meets her
actually comments on how alert

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
she is, and that's always
stuck out to me because I don't

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:90%
expect a baby to not be alert.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.660 align:middle line:10%
But I attribute
it to her health,

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:10%
and I'm very happy and
very thankful for that.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:10%
I would absolutely recommend
HP to other parents.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:10%
I think that using a
safe and effective way

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:10%
to protect your child
is the best way to go.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:10%
And vaccines are--
they're just too risky.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I would never encourage anybody
to go that route versus HP

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
when there's a safer, more
effective way with zero side

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:84%

I went through training here
in the United States at UCSD.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:13.090 align:middle line:84%

I stayed for a couple--

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
or just one year as
a postdoc working

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:84%
in epigenetics and cancer
with the focus on immunology.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, I, as
I'm a pharmacist trained

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and graduated from Mexico, I
decided to license myself here

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:38.240 align:middle line:84%
in the state in California
and became a pharmacist.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So I did all the
qualifications required.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.240 align:middle line:84%

been doing some consulting

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:55.935 align:middle line:90%

00:19:55.935 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.110 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, we know
about our electrons,

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and we know about
photosynthesis.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
We know how plants are
so magnificent that they

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:11.125 align:middle line:84%
can actually transform the
light of the sun into energy.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Our animals that we consume
ourselves eat this plant.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So at a certain point,
we're all eating a product

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:90%
of the sun that is energy.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And if I want to dig more into
it, we actually work on ATP,

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:90%
and that is energy.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So if I really think about
energetic medicine or just

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:84%

does make sense, 100%,

My mom, I think she
was very intuitive.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And she actually
used some homeopathy

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:17.250 align:middle line:84%
when we had some severe
diseases, such as hepatitis

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:84%
A. We were treated, the entire
time, with homeopathic, which

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.380 align:middle line:84%
is an energetic medicine,
because as a pharmacist,

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware that there's
no actual substrate

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:84%
or medication in the actual
compounded homeopathic

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.650 align:middle line:84%
concoction that
they provide to you.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:84%
So I saw the effects or I felt
the effects as being a kid.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And as I've grown up, I've
been using homeopathic as well,

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:90%
And I do see the effect.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%

it as energetic.

I feel that there is not one
answer that satisfies me,

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:10%
and so it's certainly
not going to satisfy

have enough tools yet

to measure how remedies work.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:10%
But my understanding of--

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:10%
the best one for me is the
analogy of the tuning fork.

[PIANO MUSIC]

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So if we are energetic
beings, electrical beings

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and energetic beings, we
respond to shifts in energy.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And when we apply
the remedy, which

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
is an energetic
instrument, to the human,

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.870 align:middle line:90%
it alters the human state.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And by using a
tuning fork analogy,

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you sound a tuning
fork tuned to the key of C

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and hold a second
one up to tune to C,

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.400 align:middle line:90%
the second one will reverberate.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.970 align:middle line:84%
If you have a tuning fork tuned
to A and you hold up a C fork,

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:90%
the C fork will not match the A.

parents the option, in 1995,

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:10%
of using my six-year program,
I also started collecting data.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And my background is in
economics and statistics.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that even though we
had over 200 years of evidence,

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:84%
clinical evidence, we didn't
have a lot of statistical data.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So I started collecting
data, and I did my doctorate

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:90%
between 2000, 2004.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And one part, the first
part of the doctorate,

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:84%
was looking at the
evidence that I'd collected

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and the data I'd collected from
1986, because I started '85.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And the first questions here
were to be answered by '86--

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:13.650 align:middle line:84%
so collecting from '86
to about 2000 or 2002.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the analysis of that
formed a very important part

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.500 align:middle line:84%
of what I was doing, but I
need to emphasize it's only one

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.370 align:middle line:90%
piece in a very large database.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's unique because
it's the world's largest

looking at interventions in
short epidemic situations,

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.810 align:middle line:84%
but mine looked at the long-term
use of homeopathic immunization

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:90%
and how that stood up.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are finding,
for example,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:84%
in the Japanese encephalitis
use in Andhra Pradesh

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and in India, a
situation where people

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:84%
are given annual doses, which
is what I'm basically doing,

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:84%
giving annual doses
of a particular remedy

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.430 align:middle line:90%
against a specified disease.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So the data that I collected,
which showed, by the way,

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.650 align:middle line:84%
an average effectiveness
of around 90.4%,

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:90%
was unique in that sense.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's certainly not
unique now in the sense

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that we have an overwhelming
body of evidence,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.310 align:middle line:84%

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.700 align:middle line:10%
And there is
chikungunya-affected areas.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:10%
Chikungunya is a new disease.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.620 align:middle line:10%
Normally, it was found
in African countries.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.710 align:middle line:10%
But now in India, also
we see chikungunya.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:45.660 align:middle line:10%
And in some areas, we have
diseases like malaria,

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.180 align:middle line:10%
though in Kerala, it is less.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.690 align:middle line:10%
But in other states,
malaria is also common.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.660 align:middle line:10%
And dengue, now more
active in Kerala

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:10%
is dengue epidemic
because it is dangerous.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:10%
In some individuals, it may
become dengue hemorrhagic fever

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.210 align:middle line:10%
and dengue shock syndrome,
so it's very dangerous.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:04.750 align:middle line:10%
And for that, homeopathy
is wonderful--

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.010 align:middle line:10%
not only for the treatment.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:10%
Given for the
prevention of dengue,

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:10%
homeopathy is doing wonders.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:10%


00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.070 align:middle line:10%
Last year, we had selected
Eupatorium perfoliatum

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:10%
as a prophylaxis against dengue.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:10%
And there is no control.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.930 align:middle line:10%
We cannot keep as few people
as control by giving placebo

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.910 align:middle line:10%
because there are legal issues.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.630 align:middle line:10%
So what we do, we give the
medicine to those we groups,

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:10%
and we just compare
the after-effects

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:10%
with the other group who
have not taken prophylaxis.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.370 align:middle line:10%
So always, the result is
successful, wonderful.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:43.250 align:middle line:10%
And it follows the use of
homeopathic prophylaxis.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:47.070 align:middle line:10%
Because those who have taken
homeopathic prophylaxis,

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.010 align:middle line:10%
we hardly see any
cases, only a few cases.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.079 align:middle line:10%
Those who are having
less resistance,

00:28:52.079 --> 00:28:52.995 align:middle line:10%
only they're affected.

00:28:52.995 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:10%
But majority of the
people gain resistance

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.890 align:middle line:10%
after taking
homeopathic prophylaxis.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So my own plans
center around India.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm making, I
hope, my fourth trip

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.540 align:middle line:90%
to India in April this year.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:10%
Because really, homeopathy is
held with a special respect

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.710 align:middle line:10%
in India.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:84%
They have a most wonderful
public health system

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.240 align:middle line:84%
for a country that has
a huge number of people

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:84%
who are living below the
poverty line, very often,

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.890 align:middle line:90%
or in very poor conditions.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But their public health
system is outstanding,

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.990 align:middle line:84%
something that my own
country, Australia,

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:35.850 align:middle line:90%
would do well to look at.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's because when
Prime Minister Modi came in,

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.340 align:middle line:84%
he elevated the Department of
AYUSH, which is effectively

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:84%
the Department of
Natural Medicine,

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.520 align:middle line:84%
to an equal standing to the
Department of Health, which is

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.950 align:middle line:90%
more pharmaceutical medicine.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And this meant that the people
running at that department

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.740 align:middle line:84%
were people who cared
for natural medicine

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.810 align:middle line:90%
and want to see it succeed.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So India really is the place,
the one country in the world,

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.420 align:middle line:84%
that has kept the flame of
homeopathy well and truly

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.770 align:middle line:90%
alive.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And certainly,
throughout India, they

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:90%
are using homeoprophylaxis.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to a very large extent
and in very large numbers.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:84%
The biggest single
intervention that I'm aware of

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:84%
was against Japanese
encephalitis

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:36.680 align:middle line:84%
back in 1999, 2000, 2001 in what
was then Andhra Pradesh state.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, Andhra Pradesh
since then has

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.450 align:middle line:84%
been split into Andhra
Pradesh and Telangana

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:42.870 align:middle line:90%
because it was so large.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But they immunized around
20 million children,

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:84%
14 years and under, against
Japanese encephalitis.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest with
you, when I first

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:84%
heard that, I just
wondered, well,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.380 align:middle line:84%
is this realistic, 20 million
children, 14 years and under?

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.630 align:middle line:10%
And then I looked at the
population of Andhra Pradesh,

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:02.490 align:middle line:10%
and it was over 18 million.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So yes, that was totally
likely to be the number.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've been there, and
I've visited the doctors

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:90%
who led that program.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at the data, you

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:19.740 align:middle line:84%
see that by 2003, the incidence
of Japanese encephalitis

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:23.130 align:middle line:84%
in Andhra Pradesh had fallen
to zero, as had death.

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when you look at
the states surrounding,

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.260 align:middle line:90%
they still had a problem.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So it was not a perfect
double-blind, randomized,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.750 align:middle line:90%
controlled trial.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't need those
sort of studies

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.330 align:middle line:84%
to prove the effectiveness
of a practical intervention

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.010 align:middle line:90%
like homeoprophylaxis.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:45.470 align:middle line:84%
The results from this, the
world's largest intervention,

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:48.200 align:middle line:90%
actually speak for themselves.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding
is they're still

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:55.160 align:middle line:84%
using that program in
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:84%
to prevent, successfully,
Japanese encephalitis.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.800 align:middle line:84%
But I've had the
very good fortune,

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.970 align:middle line:84%
again, to work with the
key people at the Central

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Council for Research
in Homeopathy in India.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:14.300 align:middle line:84%
They're doing wonderful work
there, and very, very well led

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:18.320 align:middle line:84%
by dedicated
scientists and doctors.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.050 align:middle line:90%
And it just goes to show.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, India may be, for
much of its population,

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:28.160 align:middle line:84%
a poor country, but it's
also a very advanced country

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:33.080 align:middle line:84%
in many areas of
science and technology.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It has that dual aspect, India,
throughout the whole country,

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.900 align:middle line:90%
throughout the whole society.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And the work they're
doing with homeopathy

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.750 align:middle line:84%
in general and
homeoprophylaxis. in particular

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.350 align:middle line:90%
is really leading the world.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I think
my next lot of studies

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:84%
is going to be focused,
because we've got so much

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.260 align:middle line:90%
we can learn from India.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:90%
They can teach us so much.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:84%
They can teach
the world so much.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's not
popular with big pharma

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.690 align:middle line:84%
because they can't
make money out of it.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.060 align:middle line:90%
But facts are facts.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And what the Indians
are doing and showing

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:11.180 align:middle line:84%
is facts in literally tens
of millions of people.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:16.600 align:middle line:90%


00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Majority of the people,
they don't want any type

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.440 align:middle line:10%
of diseases.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:27.050 align:middle line:10%
So they prefer a system that
cannot produce side effects.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:31.690 align:middle line:10%
So obviously, the number of
people coming to homeopathy for

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:34.160 align:middle line:10%
prophylaxis
increasing day by day.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.980 align:middle line:10%
There's a huge demand.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.890 align:middle line:10%
So when there isn't a threat for
epidemic, obviously all people,

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:41.324 align:middle line:10%
especially those NGOs--

00:33:41.324 --> 00:33:42.740 align:middle line:10%
and there are many
organizations--

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.520 align:middle line:10%
they keep on requesting
us for the medicines.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.260 align:middle line:10%
So we arrange medical
camps, and we just

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.560 align:middle line:10%
distribute the medicine.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.210 align:middle line:10%
So obviously, day by day,
the demand for homeopathy

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.330 align:middle line:10%
is increasing.

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.140 align:middle line:10%
So recently, our district
collector in Kerala

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.350 align:middle line:10%
had given order to the
government employees

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:02.430 align:middle line:10%
that you must take
homeopathic prophylaxis.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:05.160 align:middle line:10%
It was published
in the newspaper.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:10.650 align:middle line:10%
Even the health minister,
even MLAs, even general public

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:13.000 align:middle line:10%
and NGOs, they're
also supporting.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.210 align:middle line:10%
And schools,
teachers, they are all

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:18.750 align:middle line:10%
favoring homeopathic
prophylaxis.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:21.299 align:middle line:10%
The reason homeopathic
prophylaxis camp

00:34:21.299 --> 00:34:25.520 align:middle line:10%
or meeting or any distribution,
obviously, the media

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.389 align:middle line:10%
will support us.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:31.230 align:middle line:10%
Different newspapers, television
channels, news channels, they

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.489 align:middle line:10%
all support us.

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:36.130 align:middle line:10%
They will be publishing that
on so and so date, so and so

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:40.000 align:middle line:10%
dispensary will be distributing
medicine-- free, of course.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.050 align:middle line:10%
So once that report comes,
obviously, the public

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:43.909 align:middle line:10%
will be there.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:47.400 align:middle line:10%
And even the politicians,
like ministers or MLAs--

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.909 align:middle line:10%
or we have a local government
called [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:54.699 align:middle line:10%
So they actively take part
in our distribution of HP

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:58.860 align:middle line:10%
because most of them, they are
providing even financial aid,

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.800 align:middle line:10%
transportation, everything,
for the distribution

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.760 align:middle line:10%
of homeopathic prophylaxis.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.590 align:middle line:10%
So from all levels-- from
state level, district level,

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:08.500 align:middle line:10%
village level--

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:10%
we are getting support from the
various levels of government.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.220 align:middle line:10%
The media support
is most important

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.570 align:middle line:10%
because what media writes,
majority of the people

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.750 align:middle line:10%
will come to know
only using that.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.420 align:middle line:10%
And even we get the support
from various religious

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.620 align:middle line:10%
organizations.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.350 align:middle line:10%
We have Christian
community organizations,

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:32.370 align:middle line:10%
Hindu organizations, and
Muslim organizations.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.280 align:middle line:10%
And they all inform the
public whenever the people

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.480 align:middle line:10%
come for the prayers.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.640 align:middle line:10%
Or they inform that
on so and so date,

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.980 align:middle line:10%
there is a homeopathic
prophylaxis distribution.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.980 align:middle line:10%
