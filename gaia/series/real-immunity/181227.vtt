00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Every so often a paradigm
shift happens that completely

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.480 align:middle line:90%
changes the way we live.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Agricultural advancements
catapulted us out

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.610 align:middle line:84%
of the hunter-gatherer
age to agrarian societies.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:84%
The invention of the
Gutenberg press in 1440

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
expanded awareness
through literacy

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately interrupted the
power of religious authorities.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
The internet has shrunk
distances around the world

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
by connecting
people and cultures

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:90%
in the flash of a keystroke.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.804 align:middle line:90%
We are all connected.

00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a growing shift
in how we think about health.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:84%
That shift is an awareness of
the wisdom of natural healing

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and the interconnectedness
of all life.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:30.520 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Real immunity is
the intelligence

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.790 align:middle line:90%
ingrained in each of our cells.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.860 align:middle line:90%
It's our birthright.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:10%
>> So I've been on a quest
for about six decades,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:10%
and I'm really fortunate to
approach the topic of real

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:10%
immunity from a number of
different vantage points.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:84%
As a child, I watched
my own mother die,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the contrast
between natural medicine

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.180 align:middle line:90%
and conventional practices.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Then, as a young
mother, I struggled

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
to help my own children through
asthma, migraines, kidney

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:90%
reflux, vaccine injuries.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I bumped into a
pediatrician who wisely

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:90%
directed me to try homeopathy.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Homeopathy worked so
beautifully with my children

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.480 align:middle line:84%
that, soon, I found
myself embarking on four

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:90%
years of homeopathic school.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And there, I discovered the
principle of like curing like

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and the miraculous properties
of the vital force.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So now as a clinical
practitioner of homeopathy,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I meet with families all the
time and hear their concerns.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
These families are
so gripped with fear

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and they're cast adrift amongst
so many conflicting opinions.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
They're losing their inner
compass and their direction

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:90%
and ability to navigate.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
There are so many people
looking for answers

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
pieces to the puzzle.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:84%
The quest for real
immunity looks at immunity

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.770 align:middle line:84%
from a completely
fresh perspective.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
We need to know what
is real immunity,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
how can we lose
the fear, and who

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
are the experts
who are exploring

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:84%
safe, nontoxic methods,
sustainable ways for better

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.700 align:middle line:90%
health?

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Because immunity is
not just delivered

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
by the end of a
needle or with a pill.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Real immunity encompasses
all parts of ourselves,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.330 align:middle line:84%
mental, physical,
emotional, even spiritual.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And it continues to develop
throughout our entire lives.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.415 align:middle line:84%
So join me now on a
quest for real immunity.

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:58.007 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, in chiropractic,
we talk about the doctor within,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:10%
the wisdom within, that innate
intelligence within our body

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:10%
that takes two cells and
brings them together.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And how many days
later is a baby,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:90%
a live, living, breathing baby.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't done by any
outside, educated knowledge.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It was done by that innate
intelligence within all of us.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the magic of life
that we need to focus more on

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and realize, I have
a cut and it heals.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:90%
My body knows what it's doing.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I come in touch
with an organism,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.890 align:middle line:84%
my body is perfectly
designed, my immune system,

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
to do a dance with
that organism,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to learn from
the presence of that organism

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:90%
and strengthen my immune system.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:84%
To define healing,
healing is a process.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think, oh, I'm
healthy if I have no symptoms.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm healthy if I just feel good.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And what we, again, have
gotten estranged from

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:84%
is that when you're
in the body, you feel.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes pain,
sometimes pleasure.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's the experience
of being in the body.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.325 align:middle line:84%
So we've gotten into this
model in our society.

00:05:18.325 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh, if there's pain,
I can't have that.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:90%
I have no time for that.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that, it hurts.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So we want to suppress it,
and the suppression of it

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.985 align:middle line:84%
is very often impeding the
actual healing process.

00:05:32.985 --> 00:05:43.725 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, first of all, the
science is not settled when it

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:10%
comes to almost anything.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:10%
And so I think we
empower ourselves,

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:10%
we empower the
parents, to just be

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:10%
open to learning new
information, and information

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:10%
that, perhaps, you haven't
heard before from traditionally

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:10%
trained MDs that is
important to know.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start
looking, you start learning.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is a tipping
point in anybody's journey

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.150 align:middle line:84%
where once you know something,
you can't unknow it.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Physicians underestimate
themselves, I think,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.530 align:middle line:84%
when they aren't aware
of the impact they're

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:90%
having on their patients.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, our
patients come to us,

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and they are looking
to us for guidance.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:84%
But they're also looking for
us to meet them where they are.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And, too often, I
think doctors today

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:84%
are, sort of, following
protocols and repeating--

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.182 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, there's
a group of studies

00:06:52.182 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
that make them
think a certain way,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're just spouting
off these things.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, why am
I able to change and admit

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.070 align:middle line:84%
that I've made a
mistake or change lanes

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and do something different, in
comparison to most of my peers

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:90%
who have a hard time with that?

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.210 align:middle line:84%
I really think it goes
back to my childhood.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:10%
I grew up as a
missionary kid in Africa.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:90%
We were in Zimbabwe.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It was Rhodesia back then.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Rhodesia was like apartheid.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.402 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't exactly, but
it was pretty close.

00:07:19.402 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:90%
The whites had all the power.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:90%
They had all the benefits.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:84%
There were white toilets, white
swimming pool, white trains.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I grew up in a
village with the Africans,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.070 align:middle line:84%
so I related to them I was
like, well, wait a minute.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Why are we oppressed?

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I got a living
example of oppression,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that,
really, when there

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:84%
are powerful, powerful
interests that

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
are wanting to maintain the
status quo, you have to resist.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.260 align:middle line:84%
It won't change if there's
not a resistance to that.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.850 align:middle line:10%
And so I had examples, like
in fifth or sixth grade,

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:10%
I was the head boy,
so I was in charge

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.990 align:middle line:10%
of all the upperclassmen.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And I had to raise the Rhodesian
flag on Independence Day.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:90%
And I refused to do it.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is an
illegal government.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was,
like, ridiculous.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
No head boy had ever refused
to raise a flag, right?

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:84%
I actually asked my
mom recently, I said,

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.360 align:middle line:84%
did really do that
all on my own?

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.010 align:middle line:84%
You guys must have
put me up to it.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what was I?

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:90%
12 years old, right?

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:90%
She said, oh, no.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:90%
That was your idea.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:84%
You forget, you sat
in our living room

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.947 align:middle line:84%
and had tea with the likes
of Bishop Mussarela, who

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
became the first African
president of the country,

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:84%
with multiple major
African leaders,

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:90%
and we were talking revolution.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:84%
It was a part of our being
to resist oppression.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:90%
So that was my background.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:09:04.670 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>> In peaceful ways, we
can make profound change.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in the 60s
when civil disobedience

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:90%
was how we got things done.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:84%
There were lunch counter
sit-ins and Rosa Parks.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:84%
We all have intuition
and the intuitive urge

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:84%
to speak up when
something isn't right.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:84%
When Rosa quietly took
her seat on that bus,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:84%
she made a permanent
impact on our society.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
The seeds of civil
disobedience were sown in Paul

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:90%
at a very young age.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:84%
His experiences in
Africa helped shape him

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.630 align:middle line:84%
into who he is today, one of the
leading voices for children's

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.160 align:middle line:84%
health and vaccine safety, a
pediatrician who speaks up,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
not because it's
easy but because he

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:90%
knows there's a better way.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> How many times do you hear
a story that a mother was

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.820 align:middle line:84%
at a doctor or somewhere
and somebody said, oh,

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:90%
you got to do this.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, it just
didn't feel right.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:84%
But they know,
they're the authority.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
who know, right?

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And we have allowed
ourselves to give up

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:90%
our power outside of ourselves.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:84%
When we do that, we
disconnect ourself

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:84%
from our inner
intelligence that knows

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:90%
what we need at any given time.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And moms, that baby
was inside you.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It grew inside you.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.824 align:middle line:84%
We know now,
neurology is showing

00:10:31.824 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
us the communication between
the mother and the baby

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:90%
when the baby's in there.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a connection made
that is unbroken forever,

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:90%
for life, and honor that.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to get out of the
mental clatter and clutter,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.670 align:middle line:90%
and you have to go deeper.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you
don't educate yourself.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Find out information.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Deep breath.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:90%
Go deeper.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Let me bounce that
off of trusting people

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:84%
that are coming from
the same place as me.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing I say to
mothers, in particular,

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
is you must trust
your instincts.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:10%
We are here on this Earth now,
not because of public health,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.580 align:middle line:10%
or medicine, or
antibiotics, or vaccines,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:10%
but because of
maternal instinct.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.534 align:middle line:84%
That is the most powerful
force in the world

00:11:26.534 --> 00:11:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that mothers know when
their children are well

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.545 align:middle line:90%
or they're ill.

00:11:29.545 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:90%
They know how to rear them.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
They have an instinct, and that
instinct is that little voice,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's there therefore
a very, very good reason.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:84%
It's there because it is
our principal mechanism

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:90%
of survival.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And if we ignore
it, then we ignore

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:90%
millions of years of evolution.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And parents need,
mothers in particular,

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:84%
need to recognize the power
and the reason for that voice

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:90%
being there and to trust it.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And when something doesn't
feel right to mothers,

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:08.510 align:middle line:84%
they should defer to that voice,
not the man in the white coat,

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:90%
not to anyone else.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's the beginning.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Then they need to get educated.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Then they need to take
that voice forward.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.296 align:middle line:84%
They need to begin to
understand the arguments.

00:12:21.296 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So fevers are one of
my most favorite things.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.602 align:middle line:10%
Years ago, in one of the very
first lectures I ever gave,

00:12:48.602 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:10%
I'll never forget, I had a
whole room full of people.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And I went through my natural
diet, and natural healing

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:90%
and natural home.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we get
to the fever part,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.407 align:middle line:84%
and I said, just let
your kids have a fever.

00:12:59.407 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, when little
kids are little,

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.406 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
have high fevers.

00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:84%
As long as the fever is under
106, it's a healing fever.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
The body works optimally
between 103 and 105

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:90%
to kill bacteria, in particular.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So and if a fever runs
that high in a child,

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:84%
it generally doesn't
run more than 72 hours.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But that fever spikes
the immune system in

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:25.200 align:middle line:84%
such a dramatic, profound way
to go in and really preserve

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.250 align:middle line:90%
its being.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.494 align:middle line:90%
So it's an amazing process.

00:13:29.494 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
to remember that it's

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:84%
all normal, biologic process,
and it can be really scary.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.386 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
in my practice,

00:13:37.386 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:84%
I've been in
practice 12 years, I

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
get a lot of calls
for high fevers.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I always pick up those
calls, and I never

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
begrudge a parent for
calling me who's afraid.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I've done
this long enough now

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.540 align:middle line:84%
that when parents
call me, I can almost

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.400 align:middle line:84%
see the difference
between a viral fever

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and a bacterial fever,
and I can give advice

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:84%
innately about those different
processes for those families.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:84%
But once those parents get
through that three days,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:84%
or however long, five
days if it's roseola.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Once they get through
that, and they

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:84%
know that they've
trusted the body

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and they've trusted
the process, they

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
come out looking like
they've walked on fire.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So we know that children
need to have fevers.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.644 align:middle line:10%
They need to have
these childhood

00:14:16.644 --> 00:14:20.390 align:middle line:10%
illnesses and, historically,
that's always been available

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.370 align:middle line:10%
through diseases like
roseola, and chickenpox,

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:10%
and measles, and mumps.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And they provide a
type of gut reset

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.777 align:middle line:84%
for the child, a nice, high
metabolic fever in their gut

00:14:29.777 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
to clear anything that's
been sitting there.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So any residual,
undigested proteins,

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.670 align:middle line:84%
or viruses, or
foods, or emotions.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:90%
It kind of gives a gut reset.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
After the child has these
fevers, these really good

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.660 align:middle line:84%
childhood illnesses, they are
often working through something

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:90%
that they're working on.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>> This is beautiful
homeopathic thinking.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:84%
When your child is
sick, the vital force

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:84%
is asking you to slow
down, be in the moment,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and make meaningful
contact with your child

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:84%
instead of rushing to eliminate
the symptoms out of fear.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:90%
There's no need to fear.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Illness is a natural
part of maturation.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>> For instance, with
roseola, it's around the time

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.470 align:middle line:90%
the child's crawling.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:14.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So the child's trying to
develop this new motor skill.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:84%
They get the roseola,
and after they

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
recover from their
illness, they're crawling.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We see similar things with
chickenpox and crossing

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:90%
the midline.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:84%
We see similar
things with measles

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.360 align:middle line:90%
and learning how to read.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting,
we don't have

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:35.960 align:middle line:84%
these diseases anymore of
childhood, for the most part.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing an increase
in problems with, you know,

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.582 align:middle line:90%
children don't crawl.

00:15:39.582 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:84%
They're having difficulty
crossing the midline.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:84%
They're not integrating
their infant reflexes

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:90%
and they're dyslexic.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>> That process of getting
sick and getting better is what

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:90%
exercises our immune system.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:84%
We've been led to believe
that never having symptoms

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and never being sick
is the desired goal.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Nothing could be more erroneous.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the act of the
immune system mounting

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:84%
an appropriate response
that strengthens and matures

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:90%
our real immunity.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The common idea about fevers
is that we should be fighting

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:17.710 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the common
idea today, and that's

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:84%
the message given
by the doctors,

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
you know, to give alternating
Tylenol and Ibuprofen

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:84%
for fevers that
come through when

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.884 align:middle line:90%
they reach a certain point.

00:16:26.884 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:84%
There's this certain number
that doctors talk about.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that we don't
understand about fevers

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:84%
is that the number
that we take, via

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:84%
under the tongue, or
the armpit, or a scan,

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:90%
is a peripheral fever.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not measuring
the fever internally,

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.471 align:middle line:90%
so we're treating a symptom.

00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
We're treating a process
that's moving through and out

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
of the body and expecting
that treatment to affect

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:90%
the whole of the body.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:84%
We talked about when something
comes in through the body

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:90%
to keep in flow.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.740 align:middle line:84%
When we give Tylenol, it
actually stops the fever.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.470 align:middle line:84%
When we give anti diarrheal
medicines, anti nausea

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:84%
medicines, when we give any
of these things that suppress

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:06.437 align:middle line:84%
the flow of the
body, it actually

00:17:06.437 --> 00:17:07.645 align:middle line:90%
drives the illness in deeper.

00:17:07.645 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:10%
>> So real immunity is
really one of my passions

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:10%
to communicate, because real
immunity starts far before we

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:10%
actually breathe
our first breath.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, our
immune system really

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:84%
begins to develop around week
14 of gestation, week 14.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.334 align:middle line:84%
So immunity starts to develop
as these cells leave the thymus

00:17:37.334 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and start to differentiate
in the circulatory system

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
of the baby, around
week 14 of gestation.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we get another
immunological hit,

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
quote unquote, during
birth, as the baby travels

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:90%
through the birth canal.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the bacteria that
is lined on the birth

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:84%
canal sets the baby's
immune system up

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.850 align:middle line:84%
to be able to fight normal
bacteria and viruses

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:84%
that they would be
exposed to in their life.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Without that exposure,
we're seeing,

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:84%
by loads of clinical
research, that those children

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
are genetically predisposed to
certain genes are flipped on

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.450 align:middle line:84%
or flipped off,
and those children

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:84%
are predisposed to asthma,
allergies, and, in some cases,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.340 align:middle line:90%
autism.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So when a mother has
certain antibodies

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
to a variety of
bacteria and viruses,

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and the pregnancy is
carried past 37 weeks,

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
those antibodies get
passed through the placenta

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:84%
to that baby, and that
baby is protected.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Their immune system
is exactly the same

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:84%
as their mother for the
first four to six months

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:90%
of their life.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So the babies will
get constant contact

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.750 align:middle line:84%
with the mother's immune system
and the mother's antibodies

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.650 align:middle line:84%
in pregnancy, especially after
37 weeks, through breast milk,

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:90%
through the vaginal birth canal.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Or even if a mother has had a
mastectomy and cannot nurse,

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and is using donor breast milk,
you will get antibodies through

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.640 align:middle line:90%
the donor breast milk, as well.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So all of those things
are a multifaceted way

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:84%
for a baby to build
their own microbiome

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:90%
and their own immune system.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the microbiome
is like our fingerprint.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is unique.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.340 align:middle line:84%
The window of time that is
most critical for building

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
the microbiome is
the first six months

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.750 align:middle line:84%
of life, when the
baby is generally

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.300 align:middle line:90%
getting only breast milk.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, we would
have a vaginal birth,

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and then that baby would
be wrapped and bathed

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:84%
in that in, what I refer
to as, vagina juice,

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and stays that way
for a couple of weeks.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, we've moved
into this hypoallergenic

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:84%
society where we scrub
our little babies,

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and then inoculate them, and
give them all these things

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:90%
that they don't need.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
They need breast milk,
and they need to be held,

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and they're designed that
way with big floppy heads,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:90%
and big eyes, and a cry.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And so they should be held,
and cared for, and stared

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:84%
at for weeks, and
weeks, and weeks,

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and there's tons of
clinical research

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:84%
that shows that
that actually grows

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.330 align:middle line:84%
the thymus, which is
the immune gland that

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:90%
starts the immune system.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, the average
cough or sneeze

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that mom or dad, you know,
will introduce to the baby

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:84%
is only something that's
going to help that baby build

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:90%
their immune system.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Once their immune system
has been activated,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of on high alert.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So that may be the time when
a baby gets their first cold.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:84%
First colds in
babies last 10 days.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when my
kid got his first cold,

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.330 align:middle line:90%
and I was out of my head.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.250 align:middle line:84%
He coughed, he
sneezed, he leaked out

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:90%
of every orifice in his face.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, what
I said to myself,

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and what I now tell my
parents years later,

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:84%
is you just trust the body
and you trust the process.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And you understand when
something is really wrong

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and you need to seek a
higher level of care.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But, for the most
part, it is abundantly

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.140 align:middle line:84%
miserable for the parent and not
memorable at all for the child.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:84%
But those things lay down
the immune system foundation

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
for what is natural
or real immunity.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Immunity, from a
homeopathic perspective,

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:10%
is about recognizing
self from non self,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.390 align:middle line:10%
and this happens
throughout our lives,

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:10%
not just initially when we're
developing our immune system.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle line:84%
But. first, as
infants, when we nurse,

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and we're taking in
something foreign,

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and then getting rid of what
isn't nutritious for us,

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and then when we hit around
two, and we become very

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.270 align:middle line:84%
conscious of me,
and mine, and no,

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and we start creating those
boundaries between ourselves

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:90%
and others.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And we continue, as we
get sick and get better,

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.830 align:middle line:84%
to develop that immune system
and that awareness of what's me

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:90%
and what's not me.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:55.670 align:middle line:90%
What's safe for me?

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.317 align:middle line:90%
What's not safe for me?

00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Teenagers start to
go through it again

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:84%
as they individuate, we
call it, and they start

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.080 align:middle line:90%
becoming very aware of, I'm me.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not you.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:84%
The things that you have
taught me and given me,

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to reject in
hopes of finding myself.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's a huge step
towards immunity.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.772 align:middle line:84%
And then, even as adults, as we
create boundaries and determine

00:22:17.772 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:84%
what's healthy for
me, what relationships

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:84%
are healthy for me, how close
or far away do I want to get

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:90%
from certain things in my life?

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
These are illustrations of
creating a healthy boundary

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.610 align:middle line:90%
or healthy immunity.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So immunity is something that
we build throughout our lives.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not just delivered by
the end of a needle or a pill.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.200 align:middle line:84%
It's really something that
encompasses mental, physical,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
emotional, all
parts of ourselves,

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and continues to develop
throughout our lives.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:23:06.490 align:middle line:90%


00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:10%
>> I think the conventional
viewpoint would be that every

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:10%
disease is bad, and you
want to avoid all diseases.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:10%
There are theories.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:10%
however, that
measles, for example,

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:10%
is actually healthy for us, that
it exercises our immune system.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:84%
We run a fever, we
have an acute reaction

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.650 align:middle line:84%
that our body goes
through quickly,

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:90%
and we come through that.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And, oftentimes,
children are seen

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.060 align:middle line:90%
to be healthier after that.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
They maybe take those
next developmental steps.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, if they're due for some
teeth, those teeth come in.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And so, perhaps,
the same could be

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:90%
said of other viral illnesses.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, when I was a child
I had measles, mumps, rubella,

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:90%
and chickenpox.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.260 align:middle line:84%
The only one I remember
at all is mumps,

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:84%
because I was trying to
eat an orange at school,

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.215 align:middle line:84%
and I felt a twinge
in my salivary gland.

00:23:54.215 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, I don't
even remember having them.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.120 align:middle line:84%
However, I still do have my
immunity against measles,

00:23:59.120 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:90%
mumps, and rubella.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:90%


00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
My blood, still to this
day, retains the immunity

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:90%
to those infections.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So when I had my son,
through the placenta,

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I had passed blood to him
that contained the immunity

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:90%
to those infections.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So he was immune for the
first few months, at least,

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:90%
of his life.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Those diseases, measles, mumps,
rubella, and chicken pox,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.020 align:middle line:84%
they used to be called
the normal diseases,

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:84%
normal viral diseases
of childhood.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.390 align:middle line:84%
You would have them when
you were 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.870 align:middle line:84%
It is really not
physiological to have

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:90%
those infections as adults.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.634 align:middle line:84%
They can be more serious and
have a lot more side effects.

00:24:45.634 --> 00:24:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Because of having measles,
mumps, and rubella,

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I was able to provide
my son some immunity.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, the situation has
changed with maternal immunity

00:24:53.400 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:10%
and mothers who were born in
the vaccinated generation,

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:10%
they do not have as much of
the robust maternal immunity

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.330 align:middle line:10%
as mothers who were born at
the time when they still had

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:07.870 align:middle line:10%
childhood diseases.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is the time when
it might make more sense

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:84%
to be more protective
of young infants,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.820 align:middle line:84%
because you no longer have
that maternal immunity

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:90%
to protect them.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:25.500 align:middle line:84%
But, on the other hand, to live
in fear, it's also not ideal.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And one could find ways of
going about mitigating the fear,

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
or mitigating the risk of
diseases, by doing research.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know when you've
done enough research is when

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.619 align:middle line:90%
you no longer have that fear.

00:25:38.619 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Why am I not afraid of
disease with my own children?

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:51.100 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's been a journey.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.570 align:middle line:10%
So I was trained at
Dartmouth, pediatric residency

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.040 align:middle line:10%
in California.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I really felt that
modern medicine

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.100 align:middle line:84%
was the solution to just
about anything and everything.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.630 align:middle line:90%
You give all the vaccines.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.150 align:middle line:84%
We've got a drug
for this or that.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:11.670 align:middle line:84%
What I've come to appreciate
is that real health depends

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:15.750 align:middle line:84%
on a healthy immune system,
getting all your nutrients,

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:90%
and avoiding toxins.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.840 align:middle line:10%
Our bodies are
amazingly designed

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:10%
to promote health, if we don't
interfere with the process

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:10%
by putting in unnecessary
toxins or being nutritionally

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:10%
deficient in some way.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:10%
>> I do remember having
mumps when I was about five,

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:56.170 align:middle line:10%
and all I remember is that
my mom started dressing me up

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.510 align:middle line:10%
to go to kindergarten
and, at some point,

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:10%
she realized that
my neck is swollen.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So she just touched my neck,
and she started undressing me,

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and told me I don't have to
go to kindergarten today.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So that was all my
memory about mumps.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Measles happened when
I was 12, and measles

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.180 align:middle line:84%
was quite intense and a
very unpleasant experience.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.910 align:middle line:90%
So it started as the flu.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:84%
It was very intense as the flu,
maybe 10 times more intense

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:84%
than the regular flu is, and it
was first diagnosed as the flu

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:84%
the first time that we
called the doctor in.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.440 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a flu, so that
was that was the diagnosis.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But five days later,
a rash broke out,

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and we called the doctor
again, and the doctor said, now

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.800 align:middle line:90%
it's measles.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And everyone was really
happy that it's measles.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.060 align:middle line:90%
So nobody looks scared.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
It was it went from being
a horrible flu to just

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.660 align:middle line:90%
being measles.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I had one week of
rash, and then it resolved.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that their
recommendation was

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
to keep the child home
for quite a long time

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.610 align:middle line:84%
after the experience
of measles in order

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:84%
not to pick up secondary
bacterial infections.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.180 align:middle line:84%
It was in March or April, so
it was still very cold outside,

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and so I stayed home from
school for about a month.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But it was convalescent
so I wasn't sick.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I was just convalescing
from my measles

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and enjoying that
break from school.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And rubella happened when
I was about 15 or 16.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually going
through some testing,

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.450 align:middle line:84%
flying to United
States to colleges,

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.986 align:middle line:84%
and I would just
go to do the tests

00:28:40.986 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:90%
while I was having rubella.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't even stopping
me from pursuing my life

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:51.070 align:middle line:90%
and going about my studies.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And the last one
was whooping cough.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.586 align:middle line:84%
Actually, no, whooping
cough preceded rubella,

00:28:54.586 --> 00:28:58.340 align:middle line:84%
so I think whopping cough
happened when I was about 14.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it
wasn't a big deal.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:84%
As far as symptoms
were concerned,

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:06.140 align:middle line:84%
yes, the whooping cough
experience is unpleasant,

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.690 align:middle line:84%
but there would be a long
time in between those whoops.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was expected to
go to competitions,

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.400 align:middle line:84%
academic competitions,
compete for my school,

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.910 align:middle line:84%
while I was having
a whooping cough.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So nobody was making any deal
out of these childhood diseases

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.840 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in believing
in this theory,

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and according to this theory,
you cannot have a disease once

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:84%
you are vaccinated, because
you already have an immunologic

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.860 align:middle line:90%
memory from that vaccine.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, the
theory is that even one

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:43.270 align:middle line:84%
shot of that vaccine is enough
to last a life a lifetime.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, later
on when I realized

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that that wasn't
the case for me,

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I started looking a
little bit deeper,

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and I found out that
there is actually--

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.640 align:middle line:84%
this is not a closed
chapter in immunology,

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and there is actually dissent
within immunology itself,

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:84%
within conventional
immunology, whether

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.370 align:middle line:84%
immune immunologic
memory equals immunity

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.380 align:middle line:90%
or it does not equal immunity.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And there are very
prominent immunologists

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.960 align:middle line:90%
who speak against that theory.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
did experiments,

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:84%
which are published,
that prove that it's not

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:22.140 align:middle line:84%
immunologic memory that
gives you immunity.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.770 align:middle line:84%
I am aware that vaccination
doesn't equal protection

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.520 align:middle line:90%
from disease for life.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.800 align:middle line:84%
At first, I thought
that my measles--

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I got measles to
start with, plus

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:84%
it was pretty severe, that it
was because my parents didn't

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.100 align:middle line:90%
vaccinate for it.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.020 align:middle line:84%
But later, I realized
that was not the reason.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
happened is, at some point,

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.970 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking with a
medical doctor, my friend who

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.510 align:middle line:84%
grew up in Israel, and we
started talking about measles.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, wasn't that
one of the childhood diseases

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.140 align:middle line:90%
that was easiest to go through?

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And my experience of measles
wasn't that, so I was thinking,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
are you talking about
the same disease?

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.550 align:middle line:84%
How can my measles be
so severe, and you're

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:14.750 align:middle line:84%
saying that your measles was
the easiest disease to handle?

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And that got me thinking, why
is it that in Africa children

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.280 align:middle line:84%
have different
symptoms of measles

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.590 align:middle line:90%
than what I had in Ukraine?

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And a child who
grew up in Israel

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:30.620 align:middle line:84%
would have a totally
different experience

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.180 align:middle line:84%
of measles and
thinking about measles

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.330 align:middle line:84%
as the easiest childhood
disease to go through?

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So then I started of looking
at how the immune system deals

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:41.484 align:middle line:90%
with infections.

00:31:41.484 --> 00:31:44.410 align:middle line:90%


00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.720 align:middle line:84%
What I realized is that
there are innate pathways

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:84%
in the immune system
that are very much

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:90%
dependent on certain nutrients.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.940 align:middle line:84%
For example, there
is antiviral pathway

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.536 align:middle line:84%
that really depends
on vitamin A.

00:31:57.536 --> 00:32:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And if that pathway
is not working,

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.570 align:middle line:84%
then you would have
predisposition to diarrhea,

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.320 align:middle line:84%
because your mucosal immunity
in the gut is not working.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Also, you would have
a more severe measles,

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.140 align:middle line:84%
or any viral infection
spread through the body.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.730 align:middle line:84%
You would also
have eye symptoms,

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:20.110 align:middle line:84%
because the body will try to
pull vitamin A out of the eyes

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:23.210 align:middle line:84%
to deal with immune
response to that virus.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you are starting
as vitamin A deficient,

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:29.770 align:middle line:84%
you would have eye symptoms,
of which include redness,

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and photo phobia,
such that children

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.960 align:middle line:84%
even need to sit in a
dark room during measles.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, that wasn't
happening for me.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:84%
When I had my measles, I didn't
have to sit in a dark room.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.890 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any eye symptoms.

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:46.660 align:middle line:84%
What I had was very strong
respiratory symptoms, a very

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:50.500 align:middle line:84%
strong cough, and when
I looked into what's

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.850 align:middle line:84%
responsible for
respiratory symptoms,

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.750 align:middle line:84%
so what vitamin deficiency
is responsible for that,

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.430 align:middle line:90%
it's vitamin D deficiency.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why we are having
flu during winter months

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.750 align:middle line:84%
when we are insufficient
on vitamin D.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And in Ukraine, we
had tons of food

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:12.360 align:middle line:84%
which are rich in vitamin A.
We had grass fed butter, organ

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:84%
meats, and we we're doing
that on a regular basis

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.520 align:middle line:84%
as a traditional diet,
so children were never

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:23.710 align:middle line:84%
vitamin A deficient in Ukraine
the way they are in Africa.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:27.240 align:middle line:84%
When you approach
immunology conventionally,

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.060 align:middle line:84%
it might look like a very
complicated and boring science.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is because the way
it is presented to students

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.710 align:middle line:84%
of immunology, to
medical doctors,

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:40.260 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do
with reality, really.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.380 align:middle line:84%
You cannot figure out
from studying the textbook

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:47.520 align:middle line:84%
of immunology how to improve the
function of your immune system.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.820 align:middle line:90%
It's functioning, in theory.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.490 align:middle line:84%
But, for some reason, in
reality, it's not functioning.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And doctors are not trained
from that textbook of immunology

00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.410 align:middle line:84%
on how to make it
function again.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:10.620 align:middle line:90%


00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Open mindedness is the
way to advance science,

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as we close our
mind and we say something works

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.989 align:middle line:84%
and that's the only way
that it works, and we

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:25.170 align:middle line:84%
don't want to look any further,
that's the end of the journey.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.940 align:middle line:90%


00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.219 align:middle line:90%
It starts with a mindset.

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:32.080 align:middle line:10%
It really starts
with whether you

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.210 align:middle line:10%
want to believe that
there is a different way,

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.969 align:middle line:10%
or that there is something
that you still don't know,

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:10%
or you want to believe
that everything that's

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:42.080 align:middle line:10%
in the textbook is all
that there is to know

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.570 align:middle line:10%
and there is nothing
you can do beyond that.
