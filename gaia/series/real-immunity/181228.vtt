00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So immunity,
natural immunity.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:10%
You know, in
chiropractic, we recognize

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:10%
that normal physiology is
the greatest evidence based

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:10%
science there is and that the
body knows what it's doing.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:84%
One aspect of
chiropractic didn't really

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.454 align:middle line:84%
buy into the germ
theory of disease.

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:84%
That's something
where, oh, it's a germ,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to
be afraid of that.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And we've been brought up to
be germ phobic and, of course,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.319 align:middle line:84%
we have the effects
of that with all

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
the antibacterial
soap backfiring on it,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:90%
because life is intelligent.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:90%
So are those little bacteria.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we kill them,
and they come back,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and they morph as
stronger organisms

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:90%
to be able to survive.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Life is about surviving.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
killing them, it's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.040 align:middle line:84%
about learning how to
interact with them.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:90%
What a concept.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I think we as people can
learn a lot from that, too.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So we have these germs,
these organisms, and B.J.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:10%
Palmer, the developer of
chiropractic, one of the things

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:10%
he said was, if the germ
theory of disease was true,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:10%
we'd all be dead.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's really kind of true.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:84%
It's, you know, a little
sarcastic but true.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 50s, when
antibiotics were really,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, wow, the miracle, the
miracle coming along, he said,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.340 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see
the effect of this.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to know that this
usage, back then it was just

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.160 align:middle line:84%
usage, but even
using them at all

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:90%
is going to affect everything.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And those bacteria
are going to morph

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:90%
into more damaging bacteria.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:90%
How did he know that?

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't the
science to say that.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
But what he was
doing was deducing

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.580 align:middle line:84%
from a principle
about intelligence

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:90%
and normal physiology.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was deducing that
if we kill this life,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
it will come back stronger,
because that's what life does.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, being introduced
to chiropractic, we knew,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
what can we do to strengthen
the immune system?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And we were really
fortunate, Tom and I,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
to be in chiropractic school
right before we had kids.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And we learned about
the immune system,

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and we learned that when
the immune system comes

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
in contact with these
organisms, it does a dance.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And natural immunity
is to overcome

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.880 align:middle line:84%
the ability of that
organism to take over us.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:90%
It's designed that way.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:10%
>> So once you
reduce one bacteria,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:10%
when you're seeking out reducing
one bacteria and forsaking

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.880 align:middle line:10%
the others, what happens is is
you end up with a microbiome

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:10%
or a bacteria imbalance.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with that is
is antibiotics are wonderful

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
if you have a bacteria
that's going to kill you,

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't really
differentiate in a lot of ways

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:84%
between a pathogenic and
a non pathogenic bacteria,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
a Group A+ bacteria,
or a Group B+ bacteria,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.900 align:middle line:90%
or anaerob or an aerob.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't differentiate.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So you are taking
an antibiotic that

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
is wiping out whatever
it is designed

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
to wipe out across the
board indiscriminately.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that can offset the
balance of the microbiome,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:84%
both in the gut, and we
know that the covering

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:84%
of the microbiome in
the gut is exactly

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:84%
the same as the covering in our
brain, and also in our vaginas.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So the microbiome research
is relatively recent,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.580 align:middle line:90%
maybe the last five years.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
I think there was
a statistic that

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
said we learned more about the
microbiome in the last five

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
years than we had
in 250 years prior.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So we know that that microbiome
is our unique imprint.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:84%
But the research is showing us
that what goes on in the gut

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:90%
goes on in the brain.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:90%
It's the same mechanism.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So we know that serotonin,
which is our happy hormone,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
is produced in the
gut and in the brain.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the only two places
in the body we can find it.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're learning more and
more about the bacteria

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that we know that help us
absorb minerals and vitamins

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and help us make
neurotransmitters,

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and all of that
go on in the gut,

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
have a direct translation to
what is going on in the brain.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So if we are healing our gut,
we know we're healing our brain.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, what we want to do
is make the terrain healthier,

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:10%
so that's the aspect of the
counterpoint of the germ

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:10%
theory.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:84%
The germ comes along and
eats and attacks the terrain.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
The other theory is, let's
make the terrain as strong

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
as we possibly can to resist
these organisms that we're

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.840 align:middle line:90%
in touch with everyday.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
there, and that's OK.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So what can we do to
strengthen the terrain?

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And now with the current
science that we're seeing

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
is that the nervous system
and the immune system

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:84%
are really, sort of
kind of one, system.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
They are so interrelated,
so that if you

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:84%
have a healthy
nervous system, you

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:84%
have a healthy immune
system and vice versa.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you're taking
something like vaccination,

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:84%
you are seeking to
adapt, to mutate,

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and exploit a biological
agent that's sophisticated

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:84%
collectively,
viruses or bacteria.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And you think that you
have mastery over those,

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.390 align:middle line:84%
that you can wage war
on infectious disease

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:90%
and hope to win?

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Then you are a fool.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.997 align:middle line:84%
So when antibiotics first came
along, they were a miracle.

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:90%
And, yes, they were.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.880 align:middle line:10%
They transformed the
history of syphilis.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:10%
They almost eliminated
syphilis, which

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:10%
had been a plague that
had, sort of, raged

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:10%
throughout the developed
world for so long.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
They changed the outcome
of battlefield injuries.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Gangrene became suddenly
treatable or preventable.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:84%
But the dream became a
nightmare so rapidly.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
It became a nightmare for
three principal reasons.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:84%
One is that you are dealing
with highly sophisticated

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
biological agents that have the
ability to mutate and adapt.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:90%
That is, they are conditioned.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
They are set up to
do exactly that.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:10%
So if you do something that is
going to stop them succeeding

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle line:10%
in their ability
to reproduce, they

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:10%
will find a way around that,
and that's exactly what they do

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:10%
>> What happens to our
health when we go to war?

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.690 align:middle line:10%
War never serves anyone well.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:84%
There are economic effects
with debt, taxes, inflation.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.970 align:middle line:84%
There are physical effects with
injury and emotional upheaval.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And the social effects
are far reaching

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.705 align:middle line:84%
when you consider PTSD and the
severe toll taken on families.

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Being at war with
disease is no different.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.630 align:middle line:84%
The mindset just
doesn't serve us at all.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:84%
In the words of
Dr. Debra Gambrell,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:84%
"Fear is just a prayer
for what we don't want."

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.490 align:middle line:84%
For real immunity to flourish,
we must lose the fear.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are central
to our well-being.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:84%
They influence our
health, our actions,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.187 align:middle line:84%
and even our level
of consciousness.

00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Emotions don't just go away.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
The fear we hold inside
has a way of manifesting

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
in our outer experience, but
how do we let go of fear?

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
With information,
because it empowers us.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
With intuition,
because it guides us

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and helps us to choose
our best course of action.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And with love, because love
helps us to lose the fear so

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:84%
we can make wise choices for
ourselves and our families.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look now at being
empowered by real immunity

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
as experts share with us
the link between emotions

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and health where
healing can happen.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:10%
>> The other aspect
that's really important is

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.199 align:middle line:10%
our emotions and its effect
on the nervous system

00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:16.990 align:middle line:10%
and, therefore, right
on the immune system.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, Candace
Pert was the first person

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
to really blow this
out of the water

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and open up this concept
that our emotions affect

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:90%
our physiology so directly.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to a concept
that we've talked about.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're in an
emotional state of fear,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:90%
you're in fight-flight.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:90%
That is survival mode.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
You can't grow and
you don't adapt

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:90%
when you're in survival mode.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:56.090 align:middle line:84%
You grow and adapt when
you're in a state of ease,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and that comes by
recognizing, I'm

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:84%
not going to let people
outside of me frighten me.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to trust that my
body knows what it's doing.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Step back and let's be awestruck
by what the body knows to do

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.137 align:middle line:90%
for us and in us all the time.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.850 align:middle line:10%
>> First, we need to dispel
the myth that the immune system

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.500 align:middle line:10%
works in isolation.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:10%
And this myth has predominated
conventional immunologic

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:10%
thinking for a very long time.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is clear that the immune
system depends on nutrition,

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:90%
just like I described.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:90%
It depends on microbiome.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.640 align:middle line:90%
It is regulated by microbiome.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It is regulated by
stress and by sleep.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we have now the
whole new area of immunology

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:54.190 align:middle line:84%
called psychoneuroimmunology
to bring attention to the fact

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.890 align:middle line:84%
that everything
is interconnected.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to take good
care of the immune system,

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
one has to take good care of
everything else in your health,

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and then the immune system
will thrive, as well.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:12.967 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.967 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:10%
>> So when I talk to parents
about the developing immune

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:10%
system, before the age of
one, you need some help.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:10%
Your immune system is immature.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:10%
There's more than
just antibodies.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to lead a health
and wellness lifestyle.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:84%
We think about how some kids
will have their immune system

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:84%
disrupted, whether
it's vaccines,

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
or McDonald's, or just
lifestyle in general, right?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:84%
They're sleeping in
a smoke filled room.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.114 align:middle line:90%
They are eating processed foods.

00:12:42.114 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:84%
They've been on antibiotics,
after antibiotic,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:84%
after antibiotic, and
those are the sickest kids

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:90%
I take care of.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And so if I can talk about the
immune system in stepping back,

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.999 align:middle line:84%
it's meant to develop
really on its own,

00:12:55.999 --> 00:12:57.290 align:middle line:90%
unless we get in the way of it.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.630 align:middle line:84%
When we get in the
way of it, that's

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:90%
when things start going wrong.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.050 align:middle line:84%
The sickest kids
I take care of are

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.270 align:middle line:84%
the ones who have
been vaccinated,

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:84%
compared to no vaccines, and I'm
happy to share that with you.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:08.967 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to share data.

00:13:08.967 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
The sick kids are
the vaccinated ones.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
The healthy kids
are not vaccinated.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
The healthy kids are
the ones who are not

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:90%
eating all the processed foods.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:10%
They're eating more
whole foods diet

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.270 align:middle line:10%
and haven't been on
antibiotic after antibiotic.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Once we start messing
with the immune system

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
under the age of
one, I believe we

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:84%
create very unhealthy
children who

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:84%
are probably going to be
unhealthy for years thereafter.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, we have some ways
of helping them recover,

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.710 align:middle line:84%
but we take something that
should be natural and very

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
complex, and I didn't learn
about that in medical school,

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and we mess it up, and then
we keep them as our patients

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:10%
>> We have two immune
systems, interestingly enough.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:10%
One is called the cell-mediated.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:10%
It's sometimes called
the innate immune system.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And the other is called
the humoral immune system.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the way it
works, if you take

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:84%
an example of a disease
like chicken pox,

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:84%
so if you encounter a
virus that you've never

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to before,
it infects your cells.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So you have thousands,
or maybe even millions,

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:90%
of cells that are infected.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And your body mounts
a white blood cell

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:84%
cell-mediated response
to digest and eliminate

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.485 align:middle line:90%
those infected cells.

00:14:24.485 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, the important thing about
that is that creates symptoms,

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
fever, rash, mucus, all those
things that we call being sick.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
The important point about that
is what we call being sick

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:90%
is the cell-mediated response.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not from the
chicken pox virus.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:84%
The chicken pox virus is
the stimulation for you

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:90%
to mount a response.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Now, how do I know that?

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Because you could give
somebody with chicken pox

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle line:84%
prednisone, and
so that stops them

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.090 align:middle line:84%
from mounting a
cell-mediated response,

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:90%
and they will not be "sick".

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:84%
They might die from chicken
pox, but they won't be sick.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And, on the other
hand, you can stimulate

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:84%
a cell-mediated
response with chemicals,

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and no virus or infecting
agent is necessary,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:90%
and the person will be sick.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's how our innate
immune system works.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But you can notice
it by just observing

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:90%
what happens to a person.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:84%
That which you can see, that's
the cell-mediated innate immune

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:90%
system working.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Then, once that
happens, and you clear

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the virus and the
dead cells, and you're

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:90%
better than you were before.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So you've actually
improved your health now

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:90%
that you're done with this.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:90%
You've cleansed your body.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Then, you make antibodies so
you remember what happened,

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.840 align:middle line:84%
so if you encountered
chicken pox again,

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.920 align:middle line:84%
you tag it and eliminate
it before it has a chance

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:84%
to infect your cells, so
you'll never get sick again

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.590 align:middle line:90%
from that virus.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And those two working
together for eons

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.160 align:middle line:90%
is how the immune system works.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:27.330 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Fear impacts our immunity,
from my perspective,

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:10%
by way of how it changes
the whole internal dynamic.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.420 align:middle line:10%
I mean, fear
creates, what I call,

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.150 align:middle line:10%
kind of, a condemning
fear creates

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.940 align:middle line:10%
chemicals that start to
affect the immune system

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:42.907 align:middle line:10%
and suppress it.

00:16:42.907 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
If we have a healthy
fear, that's different.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
It usually just comes
and goes, but if it's

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.230 align:middle line:84%
a condemning fear, something
that brings about anxiety,

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:84%
panic attacks, things that
I see a lot in the clinic,

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.260 align:middle line:84%
then it starts to
suppress the immune system

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.250 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And then people
come to me, and they

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
don't realize that the symptoms
that they're dealing with

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:84%
are actually tied
to a road of fear.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So it can directly impact both
innate and adaptive immunity.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me what it was
like when Henry was sick.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:10%
>> So Henry woke up with croup
in the middle of the night

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:10%
and I thought it was going to be
something that he could easily

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.810 align:middle line:10%
walk through.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:10%
And very quickly, it
changed and shifted

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle line:10%
into very scary bouts of
strider and croup cough,

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:38.090 align:middle line:10%
where everything we were using
to support him wasn't helping.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we decided
to go into the doctors.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, they
suggested we head to the ER.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And what happens to you when
you're in that kind of fear?

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>> All senses shut down.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:10%
Everything is shut down.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing you
know is to head to the ER.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- it's
almost debilitating.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:12.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Fear produces cortisol, and
a cortisol response is a hormone

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.310 align:middle line:10%
that our body uses in a
fight or flight situation.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:10%
And fear, when it's
a negative fear,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:10%
will produce that
response, and the brain

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:10%
goes directly to the adrenals,
through the hypothalamus

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:10%
and pituitary gland,
to make that happen.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It bypasses other
nervous system responses

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:84%
so that the fight
or flight response

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.520 align:middle line:84%
can happen instantaneously,
and even sometimes before we're

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.500 align:middle line:90%
even knowing that it's there.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>> The ER offered a few things.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:10%
And the rescue inhaler,
which is a corticosteroid.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:10%
No, like an epinephrine.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember what it was.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
We did it, and it
worked very well.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Very quickly, it
worked very well,

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to do a
systemic corticosteroid

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:90%
that I was hesitant about.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Knowing what I know,
there would be rebound.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So it'd get better
for that night,

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and then the next
day and the next day,

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:84%
we would then have
symptoms again.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:90%
So that was hard.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I had, of course, Googled
very quickly the steroid

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:90%
they were suggesting.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the study, it
showed a lesser amount

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:90%
showing the same benefit.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I had asked for that,
and they said no.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.880 align:middle line:84%
It only comes in
the higher dosage.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.040 align:middle line:84%
We had a shift
change of doctors.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I asked for the
lower dose again.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:36.940 align:middle line:84%
He consented to it, not happily,
but he did consent to it.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And we administered the
corticosteroid and it worked.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:84%
We had a pretty restful night,
a little bit of strider,

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
nothing to be worried
or concerned about.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, he
was a little bit off.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And that night, it started, and
we were back at the same place

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:05.580 align:middle line:84%
that we were at when we first
went to the doctors the day

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>> So the symptoms came back?

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:10.802 --> 00:20:13.460 align:middle line:10%
>> So when we think about our
immune system, it, to be fair,

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.670 align:middle line:10%
is probably a couple of days
as we learned about the immune

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:10%
system.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:10%
And I faintly remember
how things work,

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:10%
but we don't apply that
knowledge in practice, right?

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Here's how you heal
yourself with antibiotics,

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:84%
or here's how you stimulate
your immune system

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:84%
with a certain medicine,
or how you suppress it

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:84%
with another medicine,
all symptom control.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>> A perfect example I give my
patients a lot is to describe

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.169 align:middle line:84%
them being in a car and
driving down the highway.

00:20:52.169 --> 00:20:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
getting cut off or something

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.320 align:middle line:84%
unexpected happens,
and they happen

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.470 align:middle line:84%
to be eating some food
or something in the car.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:10%
And they, all of
a sudden, now here

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:10%
comes that stress response.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.580 align:middle line:10%
I just got cut off, shocked,
and now, all of a sudden,

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.582 align:middle line:10%
my heart's palpitating, you
know, 1,000 miles an hour,

00:21:09.582 --> 00:21:12.040 align:middle line:10%
and I'm trying to figure out
how to modulate that response.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just trying to
consciously wrap my head

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.440 align:middle line:90%
around what just happened.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But subconsciously, my
mind is taking snapshots

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:84%
of every bit of the
five sense input

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.200 align:middle line:90%
that's coming into the brain.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.140 align:middle line:90%
And that logs in cell memory.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So when that stays in the cell
memory, or in the amygdala,

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:84%
now my body is going to
respond potentially negatively

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:90%
to those frequencies again.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.085 align:middle line:84%
Like, for instance, if
I was eating a banana,

00:21:33.085 --> 00:21:34.649 align:middle line:84%
and next time I'm
exposed to banana,

00:21:34.649 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
my body's going to
go, wait a minute.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Last time we were there, and
that frequency was there,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.140 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't such a good thing.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.100 align:middle line:10%
>> As soon as fear
is the reason to act,

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:50.620 align:middle line:10%
you can just be sure that the
action will not the have that

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.140 align:middle line:10%
you are hoping for.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we create with
fear the one we are afraid of.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we tried to
avoid something,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.660 align:middle line:84%
then we do the kind of
things that will actually

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.540 align:middle line:90%
kind of manifest it.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And so based on that, if
you're talking about diseases

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and the prevention or treatment
of diseases, what you see

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:84%
is that if people are
being made afraid, then

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:84%
either on that fear, they don't
dare to take any vaccination.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Or based on that
fear, they don't dare

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:90%
to not take any vaccination.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.970 align:middle line:90%
And so they're kind of--

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
there's no middle
ground then for them

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:84%
to make a well informed
choice based on freedom.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And not only the freedom
given by the society

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.680 align:middle line:84%
to make your own choice,
but also the inner freedom

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.030 align:middle line:84%
to make that decision
that feels right for you.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:10%
>> And I think that's probably
why the vaccine program is

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:10%
created, right?

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:10%
Like, you can't
do it on your own.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.169 align:middle line:10%
You're going to die if
you're not vaccinated.

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:84%
All the babies in
the world are going

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:84%
to die if they're
not vaccinated.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
trick the immune system

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:84%
into being prepared for diseases
that you haven't seen yet.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:90%
And what does that do?

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:11.650 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.816 align:middle line:84%
We don't receive training
in that in medical school.

00:23:13.816 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea
what happens other

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:84%
than you've created
antibodies to an illness

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.440 align:middle line:84%
that you might or might
not be exposed to.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what's
funny is I found--

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I, kind of, found my
rhythm again as a mom.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And that internal mama gut,
that internal voice, returned.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So it was no longer
in a hysterical moment

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:51.490 align:middle line:84%
of getting him to the
ER, but I was in a place

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.790 align:middle line:84%
where I was going to
help him through this.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have the tools
that we need, that we use,

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that that'll help him
process through it.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:13.380 align:middle line:90%


00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Fear disables our ability to
make good choices for the very

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:10%
fact that when fear comes into
a person's eyes, let's say.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They see fear coming
at them, or they

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:84%
anticipate a fearful
circumstance, or a person,

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.060 align:middle line:90%
or a conversation.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.310 align:middle line:84%
People that don't like
conflict, for example,

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.100 align:middle line:84%
they will go ahead
and anticipate

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:84%
that conflict coming
and that brings fear.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Fear in the eyes is what
we call it at the clinic.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.490 align:middle line:84%
It causes the brain to shut down
in parts of the limbic system,

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.089 align:middle line:84%
because the body knows
it's going to be stressed.

00:24:45.089 --> 00:24:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And so, therefore,
it has to rally up

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.460 align:middle line:90%
to deal with the stress.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, and
it shuts down our ability

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:84%
to see things in life
through the full filter,

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:84%
we call it the full filter
in the frontal brain,

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:59.620 align:middle line:84%
then you're not able to make
a very balanced, peaceful

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:90%
decision.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's very difficult.
And a lot of people

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.206 align:middle line:84%
will come to me,
especially parents

00:25:05.206 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that are trying
to make decisions

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:84%
about their kids in
sports, or their academics,

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.430 align:middle line:84%
or even vaccines, or what
doctor do I take my children to,

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.170 align:middle line:90%
or what do you do here.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Every time we are confronted
with helping people

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:84%
to educate them, it is mainly
about helping them know that

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:84%
as long as you
have the knowledge,

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.590 align:middle line:84%
then you can make an
educated decision.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.020 align:middle line:90%
And you will do it without fear.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:90%
You'll have peace.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.540 align:middle line:90%
