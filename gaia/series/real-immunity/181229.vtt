>> Stacking piles of stones
atop one another is an ancient

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
practice that's taken
place throughout the world.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:90%
These piles are called cairns.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a Gaelic word meaning mound
of stones built as a landmark.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And cairns marked the
way for travelers.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:84%
They indicated stashes
of food or supplies.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Or when they were painted white,
they were used along the shore

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:90%
to aid navigation.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I know it brought a sense
of comfort and security

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:84%
to see one of these
cairns looming ahead.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:84%
We all want to know when
we're on the right path going

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:90%
in the right direction.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:84%
We turn to family or
friends for advice.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Or we read research
to gather information

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:90%
hoping we're on track.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:10%
There have been times in my
life when something just clicks.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:10%
I know with certainty that
I'm on the right path.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I've compared it to the
feeling of flowing down

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.370 align:middle line:84%
a river as opposed to rowing
upstream against the current.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling of surety similar
to seeing a cairn up ahead

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that the path will
open up as I move forward.

"Passage to Real
Immunity" will hopefully

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.710 align:middle line:84%
provide you with some real
stone cairns of your own.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:11.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>> This system of fear has tried
to make you forget what you

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And deep inside of
you is the truth

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:90%
has come through the ages.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:84%
The greatest medical tool
you have is your intuition,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.534 align:middle line:84%
is your heart and
your understanding.

00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And I say that, I
mean, that there

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:84%
may be someone that
could be in a room

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:90%
and think I don't know why.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But I really feel like I
need to vaccinate my child.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't tell you to go
against that if that's what

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.230 align:middle line:90%
naturally is coming to you.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:84%
There may be a situation
where a vaccine is

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:90%
appropriate for your child.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Because that as a parent
and that connection is what

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.742 align:middle line:90%
you are being called to.

00:02:47.742 --> 00:02:51.520 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.472 align:middle line:84%
But if inside if something
is saying do not do this,

00:02:57.472 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:84%
there should be nothing
in the world that

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:84%
makes you override that because
that is your creator, that

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
is your creation, that is your
spirit, and that is your child

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:90%
and you in the communication.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
That is the most important
communication act.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you break that, if
you go against the outcome

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:90%
can be catastrophic.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Don't put yourself
in that situation.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:10%
>> It wouldn't be in our
physical body if there

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:10%
wasn't something to work with.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:10%
We couldn't evolve
spiritually if we

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:10%
didn't have our physical body.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
We need our physical body to
encounter substance to grow.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:90%
The glass ceiling isn't real.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And we are not separate
from each other,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:90%
that illness is a blessing.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:90%
And we have health within us.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Health is not at
the end of a needle.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Health is not in a pill.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:90%
Health isn't even in food.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Health is what lives within us.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:90%
Health is how we feel every day.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.320 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The most important message
from the quest for real

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
immunity was to overcome fear
and to trust your intuition

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and to trust mother nature in
her design of both your body

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and benign childhood
diseases for a real purpose.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:10%
You can combine conventional
and alternative medicine

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.120 align:middle line:10%
or you can use both Eastern
and Western methods.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:10%
Or you can combine
any combination.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
You're the expert
for your family.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:84%
You can do this because
you only have one agenda

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and that comes from
unconditional love.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So do your homework and
then discern the right path.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.200 align:middle line:84%
In order to be
fully empowered, you

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
need to search things out in
both your heart and your mind.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll find your
stone cairns along the way.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear what Paul
Thomas has to say.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so funny.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.886 align:middle line:84%
Parents will come in having
done a Google search.

00:05:14.886 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody
gave me a cup--

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.200 align:middle line:84%
"your Google search
does not equal my MD."

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:84%
However, where do doctors
go for their information?

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
You can go to MEDLINE,
PubMed, but you can also

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:90%
just Google it.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can
oftentimes-- boom, you

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.450 align:middle line:84%
get to all the key articles
and important information.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.857 align:middle line:90%
It's at our fingertips.

00:05:34.857 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:10%
I think the difference
sometimes for parents

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.770 align:middle line:10%
is they don't have perspective.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:10%
So when you read
something online,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:10%
you don't have the
history of having

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:10%
taken care of tens of thousands
or hundreds of thousands

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:10%
of patients to put what you're
reading in perspective to what

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.420 align:middle line:10%
the reality is.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's where a good
integrative physician, somebody

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:84%
who really is open to all
information not just closed

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.132 align:middle line:90%
minded on some--

00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:90%
that's a good place to start.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Chinese medicine is a form of
medicine that is very different

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:10%
from what we're used to hearing
as medicine in the West.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:10%
The word medicine comes
with a few connotations

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:10%
that have to do with--

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.510 align:middle line:10%
medical interventions, invasive
interventions occasionally,

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:10%
or medication.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:84%
The way the Chinese look
at health in general

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:90%
makes the system work.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And the view of
health is we're part

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:84%
of a larger system-- the
microcosm and the macrocosm.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:10%
We're not separate,
so knowing this

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:10%
no one gets sick by lacking
medication or surgery.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Disease is not a lack of
medication or surgery.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So in this sense, the whole of
the Chinese medicine concept

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:84%
is knowing your place
within the larger system

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and supplementing what needs to
be supplemented to feel healthy

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and allowing the body to open
impedance is where they are.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Like if something is stuck
or not working, helping

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.872 align:middle line:90%
the body heal there.

00:07:48.872 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Usually, when people
hear about acupuncture,

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:84%
they think that it's something
separate from Chinese medicine.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:90%
There's two different systems.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe this is a
system in itself.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But basically
acupuncture is a tool

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:84%
within the Chinese
medical system,

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:90%
which is a complete whole.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.449 align:middle line:84%
Within it that has acupuncture
body work, herbal medicine,

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:84%
dietary therapies, and
all the other things

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:90%
we've mentioned before.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And you get the most
benefit from using as much

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:84%
of the entire system as you
can or the right therapies

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
within it, instead of just
going towards the headline.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
actually sounds very simple

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
is understanding how
breath affects my body.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Basic thing,
breathing, everybody

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:90%
does it to a certain extent.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, but most of us

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.010 align:middle line:90%
don't breathe enough.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:90%
The breath is tiny.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And instead of having a
full range of movement,

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.130 align:middle line:90%
our diaphragms just go--

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.850 align:middle line:84%
instead of flowing and
opening and closing normally.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And just being
aware of your breath

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and what happens to
it when you get angry,

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.060 align:middle line:84%
when you get
excited, when you get

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.610 align:middle line:84%
stressed about something,
when you're afraid,

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:90%
when you're happy--

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:84%
being aware of your breath
can change your life.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.251 align:middle line:84%
And it's a basic, basic
tenet of Chinese medicine.

00:09:21.251 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Allopathic medicine, it still
has a big impact on our health

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.730 align:middle line:90%
and survival as a human race.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And for sure, we
need all the trauma

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and the acute
interventions that we have.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
As you know, I've been
working in hospitals,

00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I can see how allopathic
medicine has saved lives

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:90%
right and left.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it does have
many rooms of improvement.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:10%
But I believe as we go
in knowing and educating

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:10%
our staff, physicians,
pharmacists,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.320 align:middle line:10%
nurses on not only
energy medicine but all

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:10%
the alternative medicine that
is also effective even in acute

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:10%
care.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:10%
>> My own education consisted of
four years of homeopathy school

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:10%
after my undergraduate degree.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.240 align:middle line:10%
Then I went on to earn a PHD.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.810 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.750 align:middle line:84%
From the moment I started
homeopathy school,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.810 align:middle line:84%
my entire philosophy
about health changed.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:84%
I was never the same
person after that.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.230 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Northwestern Academy
of Homeopathy

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:90%
is an excellent school.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:84%
It was founded by Val
Ohanian and Eric Solomon.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.760 align:middle line:10%
>> The beauty of homeopathy is
it can take that into account

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:10%
and help lift fear at the same
time as helping lift other

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.450 align:middle line:10%
things by bringing the
body back into balance.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:84%
People say things like
I'm not so afraid anymore,

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:84%
whether it's unreasonable fear
of fire, burglars breaking in,

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:90%
nuclear disaster.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And that lessening fear
gives them incredible freedom

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.560 align:middle line:90%
and the heal.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:10%
>> But for real healing to
happen the person has to heal

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.900 align:middle line:10%
themself and really that's a
lot of what homeopathy is about

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.920 align:middle line:10%
too.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:84%
My job is just to be present
and listen and create

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:84%
an environment where people
are able to go deep and access

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:84%
the information
that is inside them.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And it needs to come out in
order for healing to occur.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.675 align:middle line:90%
And it's an amazing profession.

00:12:08.675 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always grateful
that I get to do this.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, what we find is that
homeopathic medicines actually

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:10%
strengthen the immune system
to get it into balance with

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.650 align:middle line:10%
itself.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's critical.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So the immune
system doesn't under

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
react, leaving people
susceptible to illness,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.760 align:middle line:84%
doesn't overreact
causing allergy,

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:90%
and doesn't attack itself.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And so remedies
are designed to do

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that to support the
healing mechanism

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.400 align:middle line:84%
in the body and the immune
system is key in that.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:47.870 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Training in homeopathy is
not dissimilar from training

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that doctors get or physician
assistants get, in the sense

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that people have to have
some background in science.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And then spend
four years learning

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:84%
about homeopathic medicines,
what the medicines are,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle line:90%
how to match them to humans.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And then spend two years in
an intensive clinical process,

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.930 align:middle line:84%
where they actually
work with clients

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.199 align:middle line:90%
to help improve their health.

00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
four years, they're

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.906 align:middle line:90%
able to go out and practice.

00:13:16.906 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Homeopathy is
based on the law--

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.480 align:middle line:10%
we call it the Law of Similars.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And as I understand it, the Law
of Similars is based on love.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:90%
It's an expression of love.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So instead of fighting
something, pushing it,

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.960 align:middle line:90%
suppressing it--

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
it's being accepted
for what it is.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:84%
It's being mirrored
for what it is

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:90%
and is being embraced as it is.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And actually we are saying
with a remedy this is exactly

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:90%
as it should be.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:90%
And we just support this.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the paradoxical
response what we can see

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.720 align:middle line:84%
is that then the
situation can change.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.030 align:middle line:84%
As long we are suppressing
something-- try it

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.500 align:middle line:90%
with your kid.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
As long as you're suppressing
it, it will fight back.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
kind of accept it

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:84%
for what it is then
change can happen.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's an expression of love.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.630 align:middle line:90%
I believe that's what it is.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.260 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's true on many levels
like if you have a fever

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and because there is
an infection going on,

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
this fever is exactly
what it should be.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the organism's wisdom
to deal with the situation.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.270 align:middle line:90%
It knows how to handle.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to tell
it how to do that.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
All we can do is that
if the organism isn't

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
able to kind of overcome it,
we give it this is resonance,

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:84%
this similars to kind of support
it in what it's already doing.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle line:84%
But that's not only true
on the level of symptoms,

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:84%
it's also true on
the level of diseases

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and the role they play in
the evolution of mankind.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Diseases like malaria,
diseases like HIV/AIDS.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:84%
They bring about
change in humanity.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And there is a reason why
these diseases are there,

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:90%
whether intentional or not.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But you can just
see the consequences

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
they have not only in terms
of bringing about suffering

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and illness but also about
bringing about change

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.510 align:middle line:84%
in humanity, in society,
in the collective,

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:90%
and in the individual.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:10%
>> I love Harry's explanation
of like treating like.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:10%
Homeopathy really is a
deep method of healing.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:84%
The process is individualized
for each person.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.561 align:middle line:84%
I could take 10 cases, each
with the same diagnosis.

00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And they would receive 10
different remedies depending

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.600 align:middle line:90%
on their internal state.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.260 align:middle line:84%
The way we assess that state is
by understanding exactly what

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:90%
it's like to be that person.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Through this careful
case taking process,

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.230 align:middle line:84%
we learn what the person
likes and dislikes,

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:84%
what makes them
happy or sad, what

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:84%
the worries are, the history,
the physical symptoms.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:84%
What's the world
that they live in?

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Through this attentive
listening process,

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.350 align:middle line:84%
a person feels truly
heard and understood

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:90%
without any judgment.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.950 align:middle line:84%
This art and science of
understanding, truly being seen

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.810 align:middle line:90%
is impart curative as well.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:10%
>> I resisted homeopathy
with every fiber of my being

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:10%
because it seemed
ridiculous to me.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't want to go into
health care, but I got very ill

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:10%
and was in bed for two
years with something

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:10%
that was, a long
time ago, would have

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:10%
been diagnosed as chronic
fatigue syndrome most likely.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And after two years of
struggling to get well,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
going to doctors who
said there's nothing

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:90%
we can do with you.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:90%
We think it's psychological.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Go to a therapist--

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't a
psychological problem.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And, finally, I met someone
who said you need homeopathy.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, "Oh, no."

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:90%
but I was desperate.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a doctor who could
see that my symptoms were very

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.640 align:middle line:84%
clear, gave me the
homeopathic medicine that

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.619 align:middle line:90%
matched my symptom state.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:20.069 align:middle line:84%
I was on my feet in a
week and well in a month.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was intrigued,
so I started studying

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and found it is really a
reliable system of healing.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:41.550 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:84%
A few decades ago, if
your kid got the measles,

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.509 align:middle line:90%
it was a cold with spots.

00:17:46.509 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:90%
You send your kid to bed.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Good, you'll never get it again.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.420 align:middle line:90%
He's got it.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:84%
There were
developmental milestones

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
that come along with getting
the disease and so forth.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a positive thing,
not something to be feared.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.540 align:middle line:10%
But now that we have
a multi-billion dollar

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:10%
international vaccine
industry, something

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.410 align:middle line:10%
on the order of
$30 billion a year

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:10%
and projected over the
next five to eight years

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:10%
to more than double to
somewhere around $70 billion.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Way too much money to let
something like science or truth

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:90%
get in the way.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.713 align:middle line:84%
And I'm being a little
facetious, of course,

00:18:16.713 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:90%
but there's some truth to that.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In light of some of the
facts that Alan brought up,

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I think lots of parents are
really struggling with this

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:84%
decision about whether to
vaccinate or not vaccinate.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Instead of polarizing around
this topic, what if there were

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:84%
a solution that was
both safe and effective

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and has been around
for over 200 years

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.316 align:middle line:84%
and endorsed in many
other countries?

00:18:40.316 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>> So a little background--

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:90%
I am a chiropractor.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So I come from a very
naturally minded background.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:10%
And so when we found
out we were pregnant,

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't really
interested, especially

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:10%
in the full vaccine schedule
as the CDC has right now.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
My husband, though,
that's all he knows.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we started off just
with conversations about what

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.947 align:middle line:90%
we want to do with her.

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I knew I didn't want
to do the CDC schedule,

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.570 align:middle line:84%
but I was open to
other interpretations.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.610 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't sure where
he wanted to be.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of started doing
some research together.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
He started looking up all of
the vaccines in his schedule.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:84%
What's in the vaccines, the
purpose of the vaccines.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.785 align:middle line:84%
And he came to the
conclusion by herself

00:19:31.785 --> 00:19:36.155 align:middle line:84%
that he also was not interested
in the current CDC schedule.

00:19:36.155 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:10%
>> My oldest son born in 2012
had a reaction to the DTap.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
At the time, we had
questions about vaccination.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I did my research, my
digging, asking questions

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.600 align:middle line:84%
of family history, just
wanting to be clear

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:90%
because I had my reservations.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:84%
But I went ahead and did it--
fear outweighing my intuition.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.960 align:middle line:84%
The first change
was an interruption

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:84%
in the gastrointestinal
processes.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:90%
He stopped being able to go.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
He would go for two weeks
without having a bowel

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.950 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:84%
He didn't necessarily have
pain, any visible pain.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:84%
But you could tell
that he was stopped up.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.080 align:middle line:90%
He was very stopped up.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:90%
And he wouldn't eat.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:10%
He was breastfeeding
primarily at that time.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:84%
A pediatrician I took him
to said, oh, this is normal.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.370 align:middle line:90%
You're giving him breast milk.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like clean burning fuel.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:84%
It's OK, it's OK, give him some
apple juice or some prunes.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.620 align:middle line:90%
This is normal.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And everything in me said, how
can this possibly be normal?

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.965 align:middle line:84%
This is an interruption of a
very important detoxification

00:20:59.965 --> 00:21:00.765 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:21:00.765 --> 00:21:21.300 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:10%
>> There is no stronger force on
this Earth than a mother's love

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:10%
for her child--

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.130 align:middle line:10%
none.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:10%
I have felt it with
my own children,

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:10%
and I've seen it in my clients.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I have seen mothers
who have lost

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.250 align:middle line:84%
sleep, who have slept
on the floor, who

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:90%
have held sick children.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
There's just nothing
stronger than a mother's love

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.950 align:middle line:90%
for their child.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.620 align:middle line:90%
And that instills trust.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a visceral response
between mother and child.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:84%
It's an actual
physical response.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:84%
If your child is
hurting, you hurt.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And if your child is
happy, you're happy.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And its physiological--
it's not something

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:90%
you can stop from happening.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese have a saying, if
you want to cure the child,

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:90%
heal the mother.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> With encouragement,
I gave the second DTaP.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we saw
neurological changes.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.020 align:middle line:90%
He stopped babbling.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:84%
He was a very vocal, very
active, very interactive child.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:84%
All of that stopped within
48 hours of that second DTaP.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
He would make kind of
gritting motions with his jaw.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And his musculature
seemed to be trapped.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, like I said,
he stopped babbling.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:90%
He just seemed unhappy.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
He became more withdrawn
for a six-month-old.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
He would react intensely
to loud noises.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And actually to
this day he still

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:84%
has some sensory things that
go on for him-- loud noises,

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:20.060 align:middle line:84%
certain lights are a
problem for him to this day.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So I prompted my husband
to get certified in HP.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
He being a homeopath
could do that.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And once the detoxing
protocol was complete,

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:84%
we started doing
HP with our son.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
doing HP with him

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:84%
brought out a little more
detoxification opportunities.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I noticed he
would take a remedy

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and that particular
remedy, especially

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
if it was something with
the respiratory system,

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:59.130 align:middle line:84%
he would react in a way kind
of detoxing part of that DTaP.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:12.890 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Homeoprophylaxis is
a subset of homeopathy.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:10%
Homeopathy itself is the
treatment of like with like.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Hippocrates himself saw
that if a child fell down

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:84%
with seizures, he could give
a plant called hyoscyamus.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And that plant, which causes
seizures, could cure the child

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:84%
or it would kill the child
because it was too strong.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So along came Samuel Hahnemann,
a medical doctor, a chemist,

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
a linguist, who recognized
this and decided

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:84%
to dilute that
hyoscyamus or any element

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.650 align:middle line:84%
in nature so that there
were no molecules left

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:51.970 align:middle line:90%
of the original substance.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And by giving that
solution, you then

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:59.560 align:middle line:84%
give the energy of that
plant or mineral or animal

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:90%
without anything material.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So that there's no
danger there's no side m

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:84%
but there's a curative
process that takes place.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
basis of homeopathy--

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.780 align:middle line:84%
small doses, like treating like,
and looking at the whole case

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:18.570 align:middle line:84%
to determine what in
nature matches this case.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Homeoprophylaxis is the use
of diluted disease products

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.630 align:middle line:84%
to familiarize the
system with the disease

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:84%
prior to encountering
it in nature.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So that when you do
encounter it in nature,

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.680 align:middle line:84%
you can either mount
an immune response

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:84%
or you can repel the
disease completely.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.260 align:middle line:90%
