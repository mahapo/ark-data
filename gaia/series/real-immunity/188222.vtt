00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Years ago, my husband
and I spent 10 years living

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:10%
in the South Pacific on a
tiny island called Kwajalein.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Kwajalein was about 2,500
miles southwest of Hawaii.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lush
tropical setting.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Kwajalein was surrounded
by crystal clear waters.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:84%
The island itself was
about a half mile wide

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:90%
and five miles long.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:90%
There were no private cars.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.242 align:middle line:90%
We rode bikes everywhere.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And there was time to stop
and talk to your neighbor,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:84%
sit on the beach to
watch the sunset,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:90%
or be alone with your thoughts.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
We had one small grocery
store, called Surfway.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was open for a
few hours in the morning.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:84%
We pay for our
groceries, and then we'd

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
write our house
number on the bags

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and leave them in a cart
outside the front door.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Delivery guys would
load them onto a truck

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and hand deliver them to
our house, placing them

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:90%
all the way inside the door.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they arrive before
I could pedal home on my bike.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:90%
It was a simple lifestyle.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And there weren't very
many choices to make.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.350 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
makes people choose

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:84%
a different path, a
road less traveled?

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:10%
I want you to meet
a few healers who

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:10%
have my admiration for
following their choices

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.688 align:middle line:10%
and the unique paths
that they've chosen.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:46.178 --> 00:02:17.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Tony, it's great to be
able to be here with you,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:10%
talk with you, and come pick
your brain a little bit.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.880 align:middle line:10%
So I appreciate you
sitting down with me.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your
kind invitation.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm interested in your
experience regarding coming

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:84%
into medicine and medical
school for you and what it means

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:90%
for you to be a healer.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:90%
What's that definition for you?

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe I can start my
description of what it is to be

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:90%
a healer from being a child.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And at the age of
about 10, 11 years old,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
my mom took me to
our regular doctor.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:90%
And I had a chest cold.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor gave
me a prescription.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.780 align:middle line:90%
I looked at it.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And I had 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 medications.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And as a 10, 11-year-old,
didn't really

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:90%
understand what they were for.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So I asked the doctor, hey,
doctor, what are these for?

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they are for
what you have, so take them,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:90%
and walked away.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I followed him down the hallway.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, doctor,
can you please tell me

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:90%
what these are for?

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I already told you,
so take them, and walked away.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I
looked down the hallway.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:90%
I saw my mom.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:90%
I saw a trash can.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I walked up to my mom,
ripped up the prescription,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:90%
and threw it in the trash can.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So I believe this
set the stage for me

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:84%
later on in my
life when I became

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:84%
a physician, a
healer, that I didn't

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:90%
want to be like that guy.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't see healing
qualities in him, right?

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So for me to be a healer means
when we use all of our senses,

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge that we
gain in medical school--

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.580 align:middle line:84%
which that's another story,
right-- the knowledge

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
we've gained in medical school,
and then use your heart.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Use that inner sense that--
we could call it karma,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
we could call it intuition,
we could call it gut feeling.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it, you know,
the Holy Spirit guiding me.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And so when you do
that and you realize

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:84%
that medicine and
healing is an art.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not a prescription
and, here, take this.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So healing, in summary, for
me, is addressing the person,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
taking care of the person
in a holistic way, where

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
we not only work on the
physical, of course,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.546 align:middle line:84%
but also the spiritual
and the mental aspect.

00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:50.514 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:50.514 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Originally, when
I went into medicine,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I was really following
someone else's dream.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure
that was actually

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:90%
the right career choice for me.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And after I got into
conventional medical school,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I found that I really
didn't like it.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't like, so much,
what I was learning.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And I really didn't
like what I saw

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.390 align:middle line:84%
going on in the hospital
with the food they

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.600 align:middle line:90%
were feeding people.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And I really don't
know what I thought

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.908 align:middle line:90%
it was going to be all about.

00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But it was just so many drugs,
just repeated, antibiotics

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:90%
and steroids.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I
just didn't like it.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.097 align:middle line:84%
So at a certain point,
I took a hiatus.

00:05:38.097 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:10%
I actually took a year
off of medical school

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.597 align:middle line:10%
to do some soul
searching and figure out

00:05:41.597 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:10%
if I wanted to continue
in this career.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
started investigating

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of alternatives,
from chiropractic

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.950 align:middle line:90%
to midwifery to nutrition.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I really researched
a lot of things

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and just had a glimpse of
homeopathy at that time.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really know what
I would do when I went back.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:84%
But I made a commitment
that I would go back, finish

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
my training, and then I would
do something natural, holistic,

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:90%
or alternative in the future.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.350 align:middle line:90%
So I kind of set my path.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to get through
the rest of the training

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:84%
before I could actually become
a holistic pediatrician.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.260 align:middle line:84%
The reason I decided
to go into pediatrics

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
is because I was
really frustrated

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
with every other specialty
that was available.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Internal medicine, it
was just all about drugs.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Surgery, at the time,
was kind of dominated

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:84%
by male chauvinists and
obstetrics, gynecology as well.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Psychiatry was all about drugs.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And they were so
mean to the patients.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So I figured, I'll
go into pediatrics.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:84%
You're starting out
with healthy pregnancy,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.085 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to
promote good nutrition,

00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:84%
breastfeeding, and raising
up the children healthy.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.830 align:middle line:84%
At least that's what I
thought it was about.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's what
it's always been about.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.073 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.073 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Conventional Western
medicine does

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:84%
a great job for emergencies
and acute problems.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
But for treating
chronic conditions,

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:84%
it's really, in my opinion,
pretty much of a disaster area.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to find some
method of treating children

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and adults, for
that matter, as well

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.448 align:middle line:90%
that I felt comfortable with.

00:07:04.448 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
And I discovered homeopathy.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And that became my primary
treatment modality.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:10%
As you know, you can
do so much with it,

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:10%
treating acute conditions,
coughs, colds, vomiting,

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.338 align:middle line:10%
diarrhea, ear infections,
urinary tract infections,

00:07:18.338 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:10%
you name it, and then getting
into chronic prescribing, which

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:10%
is more involved, more
difficult, more complex.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.610 align:middle line:10%
But you can really
transform people's lives.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think getting in
to HP, Homeoprophylaxis,

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.087 align:middle line:84%
was sort of a natural
outgrowth of that.

00:07:33.087 --> 00:07:35.472 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.160 align:middle line:10%
>> What do you think happens
to a person's family,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.480 align:middle line:10%
their community, when they
choose an alternative method

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:10%
and they start becoming
empowered by making choices

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:10%
on their own and not
listening to the consensus

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:10%
for their medical treatment?

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's interesting.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when patients decide
to do alternative therapies,

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:90%
it's sort of a challenge.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Because first, the
conventional world

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.000 align:middle line:84%
will pooh-pooh a lot of the
non-approved, conventional

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:90%
therapies, right?

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Approved, meaning by the
system, by the medical system.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that word
Fear comes into play.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't do this or do
that, then you're going to die.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I heard,
and I'm sure you

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.828 align:middle line:84%
have also, when people have told
us that, that their doctor told

00:08:33.828 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
them, if you don't do
what I'm telling you,

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.510 align:middle line:84%
you're going to die, and
it's going to be miserable

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.310 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So fear is a big
component of that.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And no one should make a
decision of a health path

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.120 align:middle line:90%
or journey out of fear.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Because then that's
not healthy, you're

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.430 align:middle line:84%
going in there for
the wrong reasons.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have to separate
that fear and eliminate it

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:90%
from a decision-making process.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Secondly, the family members.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:90%
They're well-intended.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And they want the best for you,
friends, loved ones, family

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But also, they might not be
in the same space as you are.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So we had a patient here at
Hope4Cancer, a breast cancer

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:84%
patient, extensive metastases
in the liver and lung.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And she came here after
failing conventional therapy.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So a year later, yes, a
year later, I asked her,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.220 align:middle line:84%
what was the biggest
change you had to make

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.020 align:middle line:90%
when you went back home?

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:84%
She said, I had to
tell my best friend

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:84%
of 25 years in a
loving, caring way

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:84%
that we had to separate
from each other.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that was this
loving, caring longtime friend

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
who happened to also be a
nurse was a toxic relationship

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.290 align:middle line:90%
for the patient.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:90%
She loved her.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But she said, well, why don't
you go in a clinical trial,

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:90%
you should do more chemo.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So she wasn't
respecting the decision

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.560 align:middle line:84%
that the patient had made to
look at alternative therapies.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't respecting
her choice.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And so, the patient had,
when she left Hope4Cancer

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:84%
after her initial stay,
she asked her best friend

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, they
needed to separate.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:84%
About a year after that, the
patient was at the clinic

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:90%
for follow up.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.640 align:middle line:90%
And I happened to be there.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that she
was with a companion.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:90%
And that was the nurse.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:90%
That was her best friend.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So now things have
turned around.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:84%
The nurse saw, hey, you
know, she's doing so well.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And now that relationship
was not toxic.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So please be aware that
toxic relationship.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And these are tough
decisions, right?

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a 25-year-old
relationship and friendship.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's important.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.992 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:02.992 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>> When did I feel called?

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:10%
I had devoted my life
to building a family.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:10%
I also had a degree in dance.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking towards
a Fulbright scholarship

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and a master's
degree in Ireland,

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
where I would study
ethnochoreology.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, a pediatrician
saw my son for asthma

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and sent me to a
homeopath for treatment.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
When I saw how effective
homeopathy was for his asthma,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:84%
that was the fork
in the road for me.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:84%
We pulled up stakes and moved
2,000 miles across the country

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:84%
for me to spend the next four
years embarking on an education

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.550 align:middle line:90%
in homeopathic medicine.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:52.550 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:10%
>> What led me to study
homeopathy after many years

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:10%
of practicing allopathic
medicine was a growing level

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:10%
of frustration.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:10%
As a medical student
and even as a resident,

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:10%
I just took in
everything I was taught.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:10%
And I thought,
this is the truth.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Then once I got
out into practice,

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:28.172 align:middle line:84%
I started to see some things
that didn't always jive.

00:12:28.172 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But one of the biggest issues
was that over the years,

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:90%
things would change.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Something that I thought was
a safe drug, all of a sudden,

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.910 align:middle line:90%
there would be problems with it.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that
was disconcerting to me

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
is as they started adding
more and more vaccines

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.030 align:middle line:84%
into the vaccine
schedule, I didn't always

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.763 align:middle line:90%
see the need for those vaccines.

00:12:50.763 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.480 align:middle line:84%
The hardest part about
my homeopathic training

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:05.180 align:middle line:84%
was going back to my allopathic
practice on Monday morning.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So the way I did my
homeopathic training

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:84%
was at Northwestern
Academy in Minneapolis.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And once a month, I would
go there for four days

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:90%
to study homeopathy.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And that long weekend was
such a breath of fresh air.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:84%
That's really what kept me
going during those years.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
The hardest part was
I had this new way

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about things
that really made so much

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
more sense to me than
the way that I'd been

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.090 align:middle line:90%
taught to practice medicine.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So the hardest part
about it, really,

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:90%
was still being in that world.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.204 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I felt called.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't heed the
call for a long time.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.890 align:middle line:10%
But once I did, I found,
really, the power in homeopathy,

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.310 align:middle line:10%
not just in my own experience--
that wasn't enough--

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.690 align:middle line:10%
I needed to see how
it worked in people.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And I got some training and
applied that training and saw

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:84%
people get well and more people
get well, and then thought,

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I can't treat everybody, I
can't take care of everyone

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:90%
who needs care.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's when the decision
to create a school started.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:90%
The school started in 1995.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So we've been at this 22
years, graduated 11 classes.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Not large numbers compared
to a large university.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:84%
But almost everyone is
practicing and helping people.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:84%
The school is an
accredited school.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, running a school
on a shoestring budget

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:90%
is a challenge.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And the thing
about homeopathy is

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:84%
these people who
work in homeopathy

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.290 align:middle line:90%
will work hard for it.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Because they see it as being
a true form of healing.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:84%
But probably the most wonderful
thing for me, as a teacher,

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:84%
has been to wander
down the street,

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:84%
go into a club or a coffee
house, coffee shop, or a party,

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.130 align:middle line:84%
strike up a conversation
with somebody,

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:90%
and they find out what I do.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, your
former student, so-and-so,

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:90%
saved my family's life.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how
gratifying that is.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And that keeps me going
through the hard work

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
to really get a sense
of how many people

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.559 align:middle line:90%
are impacted by this medicine.

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:38.515 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:38.515 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:10%
>> When I decided to go
to homeopathy school,

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:10%
I decided I was going to get
the best education I possibly

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:10%
could.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And I got myself a list of
all the homeopathic schools

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:90%
in the country.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And I started
calling each of them

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and asking to speak
with the instructors

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and asking if they could give
me names of several students.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And I would call the
students and talk to them.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And through that
whole process, I

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:84%
alighted on Northwestern
Academy in Minneapolis.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest thing
that was so different

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.960 align:middle line:90%
there was the clinic experience.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's a four-year program.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's still
pretty much the same

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.090 align:middle line:84%
that it was when I attended
back in the early 2000s.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:84%
The first two years
were in the classroom.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
two years were

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
spent mostly in the clinic,
where we would actually

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:47.260 align:middle line:84%
be seeing patients and
working in conjunction

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:84%
with the instructors
to analyze the cases.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I knew I had made
the right decision.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:10%
But the fear was
there, because I

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:10%
felt a tremendous
responsibility to my clients.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And my sensitivity to their
pain was overwhelming.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So I had to learn how
to separate myself

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and to care less in order to
help them and be objective.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Over time, you learn to
step out of the equation

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and allow people the freedom
to heal on their own.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:90%
No one can fix any other person.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of being
present with a person,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:84%
caring about them, seeing
them, and understanding

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:84%
them enough so that
they're inspired to heal.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's through that contact,
that close understanding that

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.965 align:middle line:90%
helps other people to heal.

00:17:41.965 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.810 align:middle line:84%
In my life, those people who
have loved me unconditionally

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:84%
have been the most
healing in my life.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I have an inherent
belief in people

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that they have the capacity
to move towards perfection.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that, I enjoy being

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:90%
part of that journey with them.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So the decision
to make this film

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:84%
was the understanding
that I only

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:84%
have so many hours in a day, I
can only reach so many people.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And media is something
that reaches many people.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And if I can do that, then
it's worth all the resources

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.080 align:middle line:90%
that I have.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:90%
It's worth my time.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:10%
It's worth everything I have
to give in order to reach

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:10%
the greatest number of people.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't get a lot
of sleep these days,

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:84%
because I feel a tremendous
responsibility for what

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And I reached a point where
I realized that, this is not

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:90%
mine, this is not up to me.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I have to pass this along
to a greater power, whatever

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:84%
you want to call it,
to drive the bus.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Because there are some
things going on in the world

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:90%
that can't continue.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:90%
And change needs to happen.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm here with my resources,
with my skills, my abilities.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to contribute
what I have to contribute.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.830 align:middle line:90%
But I can't drive the bus.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So I need direction
from the universe.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Direction came for me very
abruptly in January of 2019

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:90%
with my cancer diagnosis.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we think
we are choosing.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.880 align:middle line:90%
But life chooses us.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I was initially
filled with fear.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Despite years of teaching
others not to have fear,

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:90%
it was humbling.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:49.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that's very important
to know that, first of all,

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:10%
there is a choice,
and you can choose.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:10%
And knowing that sets you apart.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It breaks that paradigm that we
sit in in conventional society,

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, if someone is
given a diagnosis, whether it's

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.820 align:middle line:84%
cancer or any chronic
disease, autoimmune disease,

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.920 align:middle line:84%
anything with immunity, we just
have to know, be still first,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:84%
do your research, and then
ask for that discernment,

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:90%
that wisdom.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:90%
And then follow your gut.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, us doctors,
we think we know a lot.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:90%
And we maybe do know a lot.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.470 align:middle line:84%
But there is a lot more
that we don't know.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:10%
So partnering with a team of
doctors that can work together

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.360 align:middle line:10%
and give us those
different options.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it's
for the individual

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:84%
to choose what path they want
to embark in and with what team,

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:90%
because it is a journey.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a person who
has a disease or the patient.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the group that
is going together

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:90%
in this healing journey.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:10%
>> So, Dr. Tony, you possess
a rare and precious quality

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:10%
of humility, which we don't
see very often in the world.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And my question to you is,
what signs would someone

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.150 align:middle line:84%
look for in choosing
their team that indicates

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.270 align:middle line:84%
there is knowledge,
there's humility,

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.420 align:middle line:84%
there's wisdom, all
of those qualities

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.830 align:middle line:90%
that make a good healer?

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first we have
to know that they do have

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:84%
the education, that they
have a good reputation within

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.220 align:middle line:90%
the medical community.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's also good
if you know someone

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:84%
that has been to this doctor
or this healing place.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.580 align:middle line:90%
So references are good.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:90%
And have an interview with them.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.453 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, patients can
fire their doctor, right?

00:21:44.453 --> 00:21:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So have an interview with them,
especially when someone is

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:90%
dealing with a chronic disease.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Because chronicity
means long term.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's very few opportunity
to have an overnight healing.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:90%
It can happen, of course, right?

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:84%
When we raise our consciousness
and do many things,

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
healing can happen
in a split second.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.470 align:middle line:84%
However, usually it
entails a lifestyle change

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:90%
and a process of the journey.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So have a team that
is willing to travel

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:90%
that journey with you.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.230 align:middle line:10%
For example, here
at Hope4Cancer,

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.910 align:middle line:10%
when our patients come
for three or four weeks,

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:10%
this is intense treatment.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.720 align:middle line:84%
The nurses, the medical
staff, the overall staff

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:90%
is walking with the patient.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when they go
back home to their reality,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:84%
to their environment,
to their home, right?

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.750 align:middle line:84%
This is where we, as
Hope4Cancer, as a team,

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:84%
need to be there for them and
help them walk in that path.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.160 align:middle line:90%
So that's very important.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing,
if someone is

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.780 align:middle line:84%
going to a medical doctor
for a consultation,

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.230 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't stop there, right?

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:84%
It translates to what
they do at home as well.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> When I made my choice
to come to Hope4Cancer,

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:84%
I was confident in my choice
but faced lots of questions

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:90%
and worries before I got here.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Once I arrived, the
spirit that everybody

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.630 align:middle line:84%
works in at the clinic, the
welcoming, supportive, kind

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.920 align:middle line:84%
outreach they give to all
the patients was amazing.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.390 align:middle line:90%
And I cried hard when I left.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew that I was
leaving that environment

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.774 align:middle line:90%
and going back home.

00:23:26.774 --> 00:23:29.244 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:29.244 --> 00:23:57.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Once upon a time ago, I was
nearly died by colitis, yeah?

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:10%
Bleeding blood a lot.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:10%
I was 38 kilograms, it was.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.400 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I was dying at that time.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:20.290 align:middle line:10%
But that time, I wonder why
I too much working hard.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:10%
Because I had the belief that
I had to work for the company.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:10%
Because I got money
from a company,

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:10%
I have to give the loyalty
of my life to 100% them.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:10%
So working, working,
working so hard.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.120 align:middle line:10%
Where come from such
kind of an idea.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.890 align:middle line:10%
My mother thought that
you have to work hard.

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:10%
Humans should be working
hard in order to get money.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:10%
OK, do you understand?

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:10%
Even women work hard.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:10%
This is my mother.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:10%
My mother is so
hard, like a soldier.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:10%
So she hasn't got any
love, softness, kindness--

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:10%
Toroko, come.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH] Never.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:10%
Always, she hitting me.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:10%
Not a hard worker.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:18.920 align:middle line:10%
Also, if I not get a 100% mark
in mathematics, she hit me.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:10%
So therefore, such kind of
teaching from mother, life

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:10%
was very difficult, Toroko.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:30.770 align:middle line:10%
In order to overcome, you have
to do so hard study, hard work.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:10%
This kind of wrong
information, forget it.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:10%
This is your information,
your thinking, not me.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:42.560 align:middle line:10%
So I overcome this one.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:10%
Since then, I'm so healthy.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.810 align:middle line:10%
Mother, don't tell me anymore.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:51.080 align:middle line:10%
Because I want to
be my own life.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:10%
I have my own soul.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:26:00.440 align:middle line:10%
So my body, my heart,
also, my soul, this is me.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.720 align:middle line:10%
Not belong to you.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for making this body.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:10%
However, my soul, my
heart is nothing with you.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.550 align:middle line:10%
No, no.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:10%
it's me!

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:90%

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:10%
My life is I want to
get my life myself.

If you do this, your immune
system so up, because God

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:10%
help you.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:32.700 align:middle line:10%
And then I become a homeopath.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.200 align:middle line:10%
I love this job.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:10%
This is my fate
to be a homeopath.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:10%
So thank you for my
ulcerative colitis.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.860 align:middle line:10%


00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.955 align:middle line:10%
Through the disease, I
met a man, Martin Miles,

00:26:51.955 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:10%
who is my homeopath.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:56.040 align:middle line:10%
He's dead seven years ago.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.600 align:middle line:10%
But he is a nice man.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:10%
So kind.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:05.160 align:middle line:10%
He listened, what's
the problem in my life?

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:14.670 align:middle line:10%
One hour-- he listened one
hour without any disturbing.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:10%
He listened to me--

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:10%
oh, I have a hard time.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.300 align:middle line:10%
Listen, I have
been hit by mother.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:10%
He listened to everything.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm so pleased, this one.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:10%
None of the people listen
to me, even five minutes.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:10%
So therefore, homeopathy
job is a so great job.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.370 align:middle line:10%
Tell me your life.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:10%
I will listen from heart.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.200 align:middle line:10%
So that's the kind of a
job I wanted to have it.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:10%
So I'm so happy now.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.450 align:middle line:10%


00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.234 align:middle line:10%
>> That's beautiful.

00:27:52.234 --> 00:27:53.526 align:middle line:10%
That's a beautiful explanation.

00:27:53.526 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:10%
That's real immunity.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Good.

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:56.720 align:middle line:10%
Real immunity.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.690 align:middle line:10%
That's right.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:10%
Be yourself.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.448 align:middle line:10%
This is immunity.

>> When parents go to
conventional pediatricians,

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and their views are being
trashed or not listened

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:31.540 align:middle line:84%
to or they're being denigrated
for their belief systems,

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.040 align:middle line:84%
they feel terrible
about themselves.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Pediatricians are telling
them, you're a bad parent,

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.428 align:middle line:84%
you want your baby to die,
literally, things like that.

00:28:40.428 --> 00:28:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Then they come to see me.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:10%
And I say, relax,
let's talk about this,

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:10%
let's spend a little time,
let's address the fears.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.520 align:middle line:10%
And they feel so
much better just

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.670 align:middle line:10%
having someone who listens
to their point of view

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:10%
and confirms their
point of view.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if
anything is actually

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.100 align:middle line:84%
different in what's
going to happen to them.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:84%
They're going to encounter
the same bacteria.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
live the same life.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.540 align:middle line:84%
But they feel better
about themselves.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And they feel better
about their choices.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
think mindset comes in.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:84%
When we live in fear, we
have traumatic experiences

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:90%
from being in these situations.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:90%
That weakens the immune system.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself can
cause people to get sick.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:84%
But when their
confidence is built up

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and they start to feel
like someone is listening

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and they have an ally, someone
who's supporting their choices,

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:90%
they start to gain confidence.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And they gain more
confidence in their choices.

about making choices for
our real innate immunity?

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first thing is
to know that you can choose.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how or what
the doctors have told you

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.830 align:middle line:84%
about your immune system,
autoimmune diseases,

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, there
is always hope.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.140 align:middle line:90%
And there are always options.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.800 align:middle line:84%
When a doctor tells you,
there's nothing more I can do,

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.670 align:middle line:84%
you know, I ran out of-- you
know, my tool box is empty,

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:28.950 align:middle line:90%
look for another way.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
always an option.

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.340 align:middle line:90%
I've traveled the world.

I've been blessed to travel
to over 70 countries.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.550 align:middle line:90%
And there's many options.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And so just realize that there
are opportunities for you.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.050 align:middle line:90%
You can choose.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:47.880 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
know, not believe.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.400 align:middle line:84%
We need to know
that we can heal.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.200 align:middle line:90%

For me, I recognize the need
to overcome my own mind.
