00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza started
his career as a chiropractor.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.460 align:middle line:10%
After sustaining a
debilitating injury,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.010 align:middle line:10%
he declined surgery
and proceeded

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:10%
to heal himself in 12 weeks with
meditation and visualization.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:84%
He then vowed to devote
his life to studying

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:90%
that mind-body connection.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And he's a pioneer
in bringing students

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%
to higher consciousness
through meditation.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I participated in a
week-long meditation retreat

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Joe.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.880 align:middle line:84%
There, I learned about the
power that our own mind

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.470 align:middle line:84%
has over our physical body, our
health, our immunity, and even

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:90%
our unborn children.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think that if people
were educated on how our genes

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:10%
really work, they probably would
assign more meaning to the way

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:10%
they think, the way they
feel, and the way they act.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And so genes are like a
Christmas tree lights.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
They're signaling on and
signaling off all the time.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And when the signal
reaches the cell,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:84%
the cell selects
and instructs genes.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.640 align:middle line:90%
And genes make proteins.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And proteins are responsible
for the structure

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:90%
and the function of the body.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And the expression of proteins
is the expression of life.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.830 align:middle line:84%
By the same means, if a
person's living and reacting

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
in survival, in emergency
mode, in stress,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and no organism can
live in emergency mode

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:84%
for too long, because it
taps the body's vital energy,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:90%
its vital resources.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the more we react to the
conditions in our environment,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
it's not a time for growth,
it's not a time for repair.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:90%
So the gene down regulates.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And it starts making a
cheaper protein or protein

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:84%
that no longer is as expressive
in terms of health in the body.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:84%
That means our genes can
be regulated and moderated

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.575 align:middle line:90%
on a moment-to-moment basis.

00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But we're thinking the same way
and we're feeling the same way,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
we're keeping the same genes
on and the other genes off.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense we're
headed for genetic destiny.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.860 align:middle line:84%
If by the same means, we're
thinking the same way,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
making the same choices,
doing the same things,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
recreating the same experiences,
producing the same emotions,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.260 align:middle line:84%
the very same thing
happens because there's

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
no new experiences
that are information

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:84%
from new sensory experiences
in the environment that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
begin to select and
instruct new genes.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the person's headed
for a genetic future

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:90%
or genetic destiny.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.280 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that
sperm and the egg

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
have an immediate connection
to the memory of what

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
the mother or father is
experiencing in the moment.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Real immunity can take
place even before conception.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Jeannie Ohm in the
quest for real immunity

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.460 align:middle line:10%
talks about the
intelligence of life

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:10%
when two cells come together
and miraculously form a baby.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Leslie explains
the deep influence

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:10%
we have on our unborn children.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joe also illustrates how
some indigenous cultures have

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
an awareness of these influences
and they create rituals

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
around conception to assure
the best possible result.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:10%
>> If the seed and the egg are
that sensitized to thoughts

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.010 align:middle line:10%
and feelings, then the thoughts
and feelings moments before

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:10%
conception have a direct effect
on the expression of those very

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:10%
genes before conception.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:10%
So very, very
ancient tribes that

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.510 align:middle line:10%
had a strong value on
culture and leadership

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:10%
understood that when they
separated the male and female,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:10%
it wasn't to increase
lust, it was a process

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.050 align:middle line:10%
of bringing your
best to consummate

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:10%
and connect and unify
in this state of love.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And what is of the
spirit is born in spirit.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
What is of the flesh
is born of the flesh.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So if the organism is perceiving
some type of threat or danger

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:84%
in the environment, the
stronger emotion they feel,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.420 align:middle line:84%
the more they're moving
into that survival state,

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:84%
it's going to signal those
genes because there's

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:84%
better chances of survival
if the offspring is

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
in the same
environmental conditions.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's a signaling
so that there's

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
some type of evolution to the
environmental experiences.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, if
there is consummation

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and there's an exchange of
genetic information, the 23

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
chromosomes from
sperm, 23 chromosomes

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:90%
from the egg cross link.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to
exchange information

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:84%
for the combination
of the greatest

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:84%
expression in the environment
that the progenitors are

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.190 align:middle line:84%
actually living
in or perceiving.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's implantation and
the mother's blood supply

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:84%
is intimately connected to
the development of the embryo.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And its thoughts
and feelings also

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
begin to further select and
instruct genes in another way.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's research that
shows that it literally

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.220 align:middle line:90%
molds the body.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So if the parents are in
poverty or living in lack

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.540 align:middle line:84%
or living in fear and living
in constant survival or stress,

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:84%
the head circumference
of the child the smaller.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a larger hindbrain
and smaller forebrain.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:90%
The adrenal glands are larger.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.620 align:middle line:84%
The body has been
shaped and molded,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:26.070 align:middle line:84%
again, equal to the
interaction in the environment,

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:84%
so that there is even further
signaling for the greatest

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:90%
expression in that environment.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
then there's partition.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:90%
There's birth.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And now, the environment is
a strong signal once again.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So now, the child's
brain is so neuroplastic

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:84%
that it's deeply involved
in learning everything

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.070 align:middle line:84%
in its environment as quickly
as possible and to navigate

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.834 align:middle line:90%
in a new body.

00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:54.786 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:54.786 --> 00:07:03.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:10%
>> So the biology is the one
that it's going to actually

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:10%
rule the body.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:10%
So once they know, oh, the
environment wasn't as I thought

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.610 align:middle line:10%
and as I felt. Sorry for mom.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Then they know the truth.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.910 align:middle line:90%
They can heal.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:84%
There is no conflict between
what I think and feel

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and my biology, and then the
body doesn't get sick anymore.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:90%
That's like autoimmune system.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's say one
thing, one example.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
The mom gets pregnant in a
very difficult situation.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And the mom says, I want to die.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Just one thought.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid of this
situation, and I want to die.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, that child will
keep repeating the pattern I

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:90%
want to die, I want to die.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to live.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to live.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And in some point, they could
develop an autoimmune system

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.540 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:84%
That could be coming from
mom's fear or mom's emotions

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:90%
of wanting to die.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:90%
And this is not even the child.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So that child never knew
that the mother wanted

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
to die when she got pregnant
because she's afraid of hurting

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:84%
the child by
telling him I wanted

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
to die when I knew
I was pregnant.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.950 align:middle line:84%
That would make an
impact on the child,

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
so the mom thinks I should
never tell him my feelings.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Once the mom tells
the child, you know,

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid I was not
going to be able to make it.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid of not
being a good mother.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I was in fear of
having you, and I

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.169 align:middle line:84%
felt I would have been
better for me to die.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:90%
But I'm sorry for that.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad you are here.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:90%
And I love your existence.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:90%
No conflict.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:10%
>> So in your
clinical observation,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:10%
do you see this pass through
multiple generations?

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:10%
Can something like this
impact immunity from two,

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:10%
three generations back?

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Bible talks I think
if I'm recalling correct six

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.010 align:middle line:90%
generations.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:90%
So, of course.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:84%
As we carry in our
genes, we carry

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:84%
the color of the hair,
the eyes, the skin,

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:84%
we also carry emotional
trauma from our ancestors.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So it is very important to
know about our background.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Where are we coming from?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.630 align:middle line:84%
We cannot just say, I don't
want to talk about my family.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to talk about
anybody, because that

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:90%
is denying your existence.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:84%
That is denying something that
is in you that you are not

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:90%
recognizing.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And we should always
honor our ancestry,

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:90%
so we can honor ourselves.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, the more we know of
our ancestors, the better.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And there is this
connection between like if I

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:42.280 align:middle line:84%
am number two in
my number of birth

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and miscarriages
and abortions count,

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and they have to be between
the same mother and father.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:84%
But if I find what's my
number, what's my spot,

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and then I look
for everybody that

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:84%
is the same number in my
family, I could be connected.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I am two and
my grandmother was two, then

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
if she didn't resolve
something, maybe I

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.040 align:middle line:84%
will have to resolve it
through a journey of a disease.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So we have the opportunity
to resolve these things

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:90%
and heal generations--

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course--

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Going forward.

00:10:16.638 --> 00:10:19.602 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:19.602 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:10%
>> So it tends to model and
pay attention to behaviors.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's neurons in the
brain called mirror neurons that

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
are actually priming
the brain to demonstrate

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:90%
the same behavior.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And when a female lioness is
teaching her cubs how to hunt,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:84%
she doesn't say,
OK, you go that way.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.060 align:middle line:90%
You go that way.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go this way.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:84%
She basically changes
the way she does things.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And it catches all
of their attention.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:84%
She's no longer
mom in that moment.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:90%
She's now a predator.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And they all put all of
their attention on her.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And they are used to
neurologically doing that,

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.970 align:middle line:84%
so they have the
circuitry in place.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, she starts
to move in an environment.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And the same neurons
in their brains

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:84%
are turning on as if
they were hunting.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:90%
She's priming their brain.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:84%
She's selecting and instructing
neurological networks

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and saying, don't pay
attention to what I'm saying.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Notice what I'm doing.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And mirror neurons
are empathy neurons.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:90%
They emulate behaviors.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the children
in our environment

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:84%
that we're raising
in a specific place

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:84%
are being raised by parents with
the same genetic propensities,

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.940 align:middle line:84%
the same automatic programs,
the same emotional reactions.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally
what is beginning

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:84%
to subconsciously program them
through their mirror neurons

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time lay the
foundation of their identity

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:90%
and personality.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're basically
modeling our behaviors.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.285 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:17.285 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.020 align:middle line:10%
>> So there was a study
done on visualization,

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:10%
visualizing your immune cells,
visualizing your T cells,

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:10%
your macrophages.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Macrophages are
like Pac Man cells.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're focused on cancer
cells, bacteria and virus.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:49.390 align:middle line:84%
They gobble them up and,
you know, dispose of them.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And so this visualization
study was done for patients

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:84%
blood test was taken
prior to the visualization

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:90%
and then after.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And they found a significant
improvement in immune cells

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.860 align:middle line:90%
just from visualization.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So the patients would just
imagine their T cells, B cells,

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.160 align:middle line:84%
macrophages, dendritic cells
attacking cancer cells,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:84%
attacking viruses, attacking
bacteria, and also,

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.850 align:middle line:84%
in autoimmune diseases,
regulating the immune system,

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:84%
getting to a balanced
state, a regulation state.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So that was a nice, very well
done study on visualization.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So the thoughts, the
emotions, all this

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:41.260 align:middle line:84%
has a very important
role in immune integrity,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:84%
because every cell is
communicating with each other.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
information transfer.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is at the root
of health and/or disease.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So when information
that we bring inside

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:84%
from the external
environment is positive,

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:84%
it's uplifting, it's
loving, then these cells,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:90%
that's what they know.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're going to
communicate with each other.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is disfavorable
to a disease process.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So it sounds like you're
saying that making our own

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:84%
choices and thus empowering
ourselves has a tremendous

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:84%
effect on the immune system
that's scientifically

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:90%
measurable.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
when you say empowerment,

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
my thought right there
was just healthy thoughts,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, healthy attitude,
because that's really

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:84%
what empowers us,
right, showing love.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And chronic disease
patients, in my experience

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.210 align:middle line:84%
of almost 30 years in this
field of holistic, integrative,

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.390 align:middle line:84%
alternative medicine, is
that chronic disease patients

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:90%
are more givers than receivers.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to learn
how to receive also.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's empowering because
most of these patients

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.610 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen, they're
just givers, givers.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.887 align:middle line:10%
And so it's empowering also
to learn how to receive.

00:15:07.887 --> 00:15:11.366 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:11.366 --> 00:15:22.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we measured cortisol
levels, the stress hormone.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.900 align:middle line:10%
We measured immunoglobulin
A. We wanted

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:10%
to see if a person's living
in survival and stress

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:10%
and their cortisol
levels are up,

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:10%
their immune system
is suppressed.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.120 align:middle line:90%
It dials down.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But if we could teach them how
to create an elevated emotion

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.370 align:middle line:84%
like gratitude and that
they were safe enough

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.360 align:middle line:84%
to open their hearts could
they begin to down regulate

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:84%
the gene for cortisol
production and up regulate

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:84%
the gene for a
stronger immune system

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
equipped to deal with greater
environmental challenges.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So that we're immune to the
conditions in our lives.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And cortisol levels
dropped 16.25%

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and IGA levels went up
49.5% in the collective.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And the worst thing that could
happen to us if we get grateful

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and move out of survival is
that we'll begin to heal.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:84%
People do the best with what
they think is available.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you have the limited
understanding that there's

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
only one solution to a
condition or problem, then

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:84%
more than likely
you've closed your mind

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.731 align:middle line:90%
to other possibilities.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:10%
So, Dr. Leslie, explained
to me a little bit

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:20.830 align:middle line:10%
about heart coherence.

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:21.630 align:middle line:10%
What is that?

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.220 align:middle line:10%
And how does it work?

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.559 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, coherence
itself it's connectivity.

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:90%
It's connection.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:90%
We are all connected.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm connected with
you, you with me.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.950 align:middle line:84%
We create these
net of connections.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So coherence, the
heart coherence,

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:90%
is whatever you feel.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:84%
People around you can sense
it, will be influenced by it.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And the mother and child
are very connected.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they say
that you can feel

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:84%
what mom is feeling even though
you are in different places.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:90%
That's the heart coherence.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.160 align:middle line:84%
When you just sense
something's wrong

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and then you make a phone
call, it's like I was right.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Mom is not feeling well.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think that coherence
never goes away,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.850 align:middle line:84%
because moms and kids and
babies, we're connected.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And it depends of
what the soul journey

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.390 align:middle line:84%
needs to learn that will
connect with different people

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:90%
in different levels.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:10%
And the coherence
of the heart is

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:10%
one of the ones that
gets locked when

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:10%
we get caught in this matrix
of the external world,

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.570 align:middle line:10%
when we are not focused on
what we feel, what we are,

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:10%
our inner light.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:84%
When we are so
much in the out, we

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:90%
forget about that connection.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's when we feel lost.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.484 align:middle line:84%
So it is very important
to connect to the heart.

00:18:49.484 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Well the first thing that
feeds me is my spiritual

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.360 align:middle line:10%
connection with God, because
that's where we come from.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:90%
That's the essence of our being.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I've been around patients
who are near death.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And whatever religion they are
or even if they're atheists,

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:84%
one of their last
words or thoughts

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
that they expressed
verbally is "God, help me."

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So I think at a
deep, human level,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:84%
we do know that
there is a creator,

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:90%
that there is an almighty being.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So to ground, to
empower myself, we

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
need to go to what some call
the source, the source of it.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And what happens then
is that you're at peace.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.510 align:middle line:90%
You're free.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:90%
You can heal.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:90%
You're in a state of healing.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And disease doesn't
like this because this

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:90%
is of not of the dark side.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:90%
This is light.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:90%
And we want to be in the light.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:90%
So that will be my first thing.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And to empower myself,
being around cancer patients

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and patients with chronic
disease for so many years,

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I have to actively
and physically

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
do something that
will empower me

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
in knowing that,
hey, I'm not just

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
sitting around hoping
that I don't get

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:90%
a disease or a chronic disease.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So detoxification, the
seven key principles

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:84%
that I talk about in my
book "Hope for Cancer,"

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:28.050 align:middle line:84%
seven principles to
remove fear and empower

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:90%
your healing journey.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:90%
So we talk about oxygenation.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:90%
We talk about detoxification.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the emotional
and spiritual part

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.060 align:middle line:90%
of health and healing.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So all these seven
key principles

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:84%
that we outline in the book
very thoroughly empower us.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we're not just
hoping, right, waiting that--

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:84%
because my father had prostate
cancer, I hope I don't get it.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:55.170 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm empowering
myself proactively

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:84%
to decrease significantly
my risk or possibility

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.187 align:middle line:90%
of acquiring cancer.

00:21:01.187 --> 00:21:03.175 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:03.175 --> 00:21:04.670 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> A simple thing that doesn't
cost anything is laughter.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Laughter, smiling,
happiness in our lives,

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
This is clinically
and scientifically

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:84%
proven how it up regulates
our immune system immediately

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:90%
and lasts for some time.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So just being happy,
laughing, greatly

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:90%
stimulates our immune system.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Secondly will be to get a proper
night's sleep, because we know

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that from 10:00 PM
to 2:00 AM is when

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.920 align:middle line:84%
our body heals, regenerates,
and repairs ideally.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to be in bed and
asleep in those time frame.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Thirdly is, of course,
to detoxify, eat

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:90%
healthy, drink plenty of water.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Make good, healthy
nutritional food choices--

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.530 align:middle line:90%
no GMOs, free of pesticide.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're not increasing
the toxic burden

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:06.908 align:middle line:84%
that we may have already just
from living in this world.

00:22:06.908 --> 00:22:09.403 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:09.403 --> 00:22:22.880 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, who I--

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:10%
in my work, in everyday nature,
I live a lot in my mind.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
But I think the existence of my
daughter in a personal levels,

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:42.230 align:middle line:84%
she's the one that opened my
other me, which was my heart.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And by that I'm able to
connect with both of them.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So for me, my safe spot
of opening up my heart

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:90%
is children.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:90%
That's where I feel safe.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And animals, nature,
that's where I feel safe.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So by that, I think it's an
everyday thing by connecting

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.890 align:middle line:90%
and wanting to help.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So my real connection
is feeling that

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:84%
wholeness where I feel
connected and where

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I'm being
useful to others.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.630 align:middle line:10%
>> So there's no doubt
whatsoever that our thoughts

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.260 align:middle line:10%
and emotions play a very
strong role in our health

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.370 align:middle line:10%
and immunity.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
As we learned in the
quest for real immunity,

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:90%
germs are not the culprit.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Health and immunity reside
within us, not outside of us.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.480 align:middle line:10%
Throughout the "Real
Immunity" series,

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:10%
we've learned that information
is the antidote to fear.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're afraid, you just
need to do more research.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Learn more.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Know more.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Understand more.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Joe would agree.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.920 align:middle line:10%
>> I think the number one
thing we have to do is educate

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:10%
ourselves about the truth,
about how powerful and strong

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.660 align:middle line:10%
our immune system is.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have to trust our innate
intuition that we can adapt

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:90%
and that we can heal.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's a delicate
balance between intention

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:90%
and surrender.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you have the
intention, but you're

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.380 align:middle line:84%
in lack or separation,
we try harder.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the solution.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And we could
surrender, but if we

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle line:84%
don't have a clear
intention, then we

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:84%
become lazy and lethargic
and we don't really

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.060 align:middle line:84%
do anything to set our mind
in the right direction.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you begin
to marry those

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and you walk that
razor's edge, you

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:84%
teach people how to
trust in health and trust

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:84%
in well-being, trust in the
body's innate capacity to heal,

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.070 align:middle line:84%
to believe that your body's
immune system has a memory.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And then number two, teach
your children the truth.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Tell them germs do
not create disease.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Tell them the majority of
the bacteria in their bodies

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:90%
are alive.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're called
opportunistic bacteria

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:84%
because they're waiting
for an opportunity for you

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.440 align:middle line:84%
to get out of balance,
for you to go back

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.280 align:middle line:84%
into survival and stress and
suppress your immune system.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.800 align:middle line:84%
If you were to change the
way you thought and the way

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.550 align:middle line:84%
you felt, that truly you
taught them how to do that,

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:84%
then they would have the
natural capacity in the belief

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.120 align:middle line:84%
that their immune
system has a memory.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.425 align:middle line:84%
It's the rudimentary
nervous system.

00:25:30.425 --> 00:25:31.225 align:middle line:90%
It has a memory.

00:25:31.225 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:90%
It memorizes invaders.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And when it's coherent and in
balance and we are feeling safe

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're feeling
present, it gets stronger.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if we teach
our children the truth about it,

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:84%
they'll begin to rely less on
anything outside of them, that

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:84%
to change how they
feel inside of them.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think they'll
be less seduced

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:84%
into a pharmaceutical
model that has

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:90%
its benefits in the short term.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:84%
But with chronic
health conditions

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that require a
lifestyle change means

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to have
to actually do something

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and to participate in our own
healing and in our own health.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:28.500 align:middle line:10%
So I think learning and
experimenting and being

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:10%
able to not only understand
that, but be able to express it

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:10%
and to say it in a
coherent and clear way,

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:10%
I think it makes
us better equipped

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.610 align:middle line:10%
to then defend our new belief.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And that gives people
permission to do the same.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And by teaching our
children the way

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:84%
it is, I think it helps
change the future.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:90%
I've never immunized my kids.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:90%
I never would.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And I went through that
period talking to educators,

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:84%
talking to administrators
about all of it.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think, you
know, it's information

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.833 align:middle line:90%
is getting out there.

00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:15.791 align:middle line:90%

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I shared my most recent book,
"There Is a Choice," with Dr.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Joe.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was very curious about
the studies in the book.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And he was also familiar
with homeoprophylaxis.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:10%
In "Passage to
Real Immunity," we

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.580 align:middle line:10%
took a closer look at
parents and doctors

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:10%
using homeoprophylaxis
and also spoke

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Isaac Golden, the
world's leading researcher

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.510 align:middle line:10%
for homeoprophylaxis.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:10%
Homeoprophylaxis
is also called HP.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:90%
It's been around for 200 years.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Is about 90% effective
across the board.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
it removes the fear

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that's the biggest impediment
to our real immunity.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.780 align:middle line:10%
>> We can't face these
problems in fear,

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:10%
because that's
going to weaken us.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:10%
We have to face them in courage.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And we can't do
what's been done.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:90%
We've got to do it differently.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So nice fast track
to enlightenment

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
is be the very thing you
want your children to be,

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.700 align:middle line:84%
because you can't say
to your child stop

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.490 align:middle line:84%
being such an
emotional basket case,

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.730 align:middle line:90%
because they're witnessing you.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:84%
They're paying attention
to who you're being.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And our mirror neurons,
modeling neurons,

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:84%
that emulate behaviors
I think are always

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.410 align:middle line:90%
active in most human beings.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what kind of creates

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:52.460 align:middle line:84%
this mass consciousness, maybe
even mass limitation or mass

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:84%
unconsciousness, in the way that
we believe we're so limited.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And our research shows that
10 minutes of gratitude a day,

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:84%
three times a day for three days
strengthens the immune system

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:90%
by 50%.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.740 align:middle line:84%
That we begin to produce
a chemical called

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.770 align:middle line:84%
IGA, immunoglobulin
A, your body's

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:84%
primary defense against
bacteria and viruses.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the body's
natural flu shot.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's better
than any flu shot.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout "The Real
Immunity" series, Quest,

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Passage, and now Choosing,
I've tried to communicate

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:37.250 align:middle line:84%
the importance of letting go of
fear, trusting your intuition,

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and making the most
conscious choices possible.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:44.690 align:middle line:84%
My own cancer diagnosis threw an
enormous challenge in my path,

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:84%
calling me to follow
my own advice.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.980 align:middle line:10%
I've struggled with balancing
intuition with surrender,

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:10%
just as Dr. Joe describes.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.380 align:middle line:10%
I've come to understand
that real immunity is

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:02.840 align:middle line:10%
a dynamic process, one that
calls us to be our best.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.930 align:middle line:90%
No one can give you immunity.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.420 align:middle line:90%
You already possess it.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.060 align:middle line:84%
No one can tell you what's
best for your health

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.350 align:middle line:90%
or your children's.

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Only you know that.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly,
life has intelligence.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And we all have access
to that intelligence.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:28.700 align:middle line:84%
We all have access to the
amazing power of real immunity.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
All of our questions may
not always be answered.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning that maybe it's
a matter of living gracefully

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.550 align:middle line:90%
with some of the questions.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.752 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, first of all, never
be afraid of connecting

00:30:42.752 --> 00:30:44.960 align:middle line:10%
to the heart, because the
heart is going to bring you

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.790 align:middle line:10%
to connect to your soul.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And once you
connect to the soul,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.630 align:middle line:90%
it connects to the source.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's where immunity
comes from feeling protected.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.890 align:middle line:90%
We are all protected.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:58.850 align:middle line:90%
There is God.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And there is no way to feel
that you can't protect yourself

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Once you are in your light,
you connect to the source,

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and you shouldn't be
afraid of anything.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:23.600 align:middle line:90%
