00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.680 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that we
have, as a society,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:10%
given up our idea that
we can heal ourself.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.360 align:middle line:84%
We go to the doctor
for the answer.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that,
we give up that idea

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that the healing
lives within our body.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as we
give up that image,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
the healing doesn't
live in our body.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:90%
And we might go to the doctor.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And we might get better
for two weeks, four weeks.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as the doctor
isn't managing our illness,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
we get sick again because
we're depending on the doctor's

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:90%
consciousness to heal us.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, the empowered
part, I'm not sure we ever start

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I know from that
first phone call

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:84%
into the doctor's office
saying, I think I'm pregnant,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
there is doubt in hesitation
in you calling and saying that.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a very curious thing.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And so you're asked to
come in and confirm it.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.415 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's confirmed
with the exact same test

00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:90%
that you do at home.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's a process of no
longer you being a part of it.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.130 align:middle line:84%
You're only a part of it
when you're in their space,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%
in that clinic space,
then you're pregnant.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But there's no way you're
pregnant outside of this space.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think it kind
of starts there.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And you have to kind
of take it back.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And finding the right providers
that actually support this.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.374 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are
plenty of providers.

00:01:56.374 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
We have been
fortunate enough here

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
to find a couple of them
that are really amazing

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and use verbiage like,
well, what do you see,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:84%
rather than us being kind
of at their mercy for what

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:90%
they think.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a long process,
but I have found it.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think the biggest
thing that I've come to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
is that these little
babies, I'm their healer.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm their mom.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting teary
eyed thinking about it,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:84%
but it's my job
and no one else's.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Just mine.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And your love for your boys
qualifies you to be able to do

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.425 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially when
patients have a diagnosis,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:84%
they tend to go into a
fearful, PTSD type of state.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
It's much harder to
use your intuition

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:90%
when you're in a state of fear.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.220 align:middle line:84%
We give up our power to the
person in the white coat,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
forgetting that we're really
the only ones who have

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle line:90%
all the answers for ourselves.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Looking outside of
ourselves for healing

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.940 align:middle line:84%
is misguided because
when we depend

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.577 align:middle line:84%
on the consciousness
of another, it detracts

00:03:05.577 --> 00:03:06.660 align:middle line:90%
from our own inner wisdom.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
But the diagnosis is
completely an illusion.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not accurate.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Doctors say this word and then
the word has incredible power

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:90%
to control you.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most doctors
are trained to identify

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and eliminate symptoms,
rather than the underlying

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:90%
cause of an illness.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Our symptoms are the
expression of the physical body

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
that provide clues
about the nature

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:90%
and origin of the disease.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.815 align:middle line:84%
Acute symptoms then serve as
event for the deeper pathology.

00:03:38.815 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:84%
When they're suppressed,
they're driven

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:84%
deeper and much more
serious illness can occur.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.838 align:middle line:90%

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>> We see this all the time.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:84%
People are generally
afraid of their symptoms.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
We rush to take a pill, calm
a fever, suppress a cough.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
When in reality, those
symptoms are the body's way

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
of combating an illness
and speaking to us.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What are your resources,
Andrea, that you use?

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we use
quite a few of them.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:10%
One, you, as a homeopath.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:10%
And you've guided me as well
in that journey and learning

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:10%
for myself, which has been
great and it's been amazing.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:90%
But chiropractic care.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:90%
We use essential oils.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:84%
We use solid nutrition
supplementation.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And being a licensed
acupuncturist,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I will use some of those
modalities as well, if need be.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:90%
But it's seeing all your tools.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:84%
You need to find a little
bit of objectivity mixed

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:90%
with a little bit of intuition.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is a representation
of our health in a health

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:90%
helix.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And coming in here at
birth, we naturally

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
experience ear infections,
colds, flu, minor infections,

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:90%
fevers, rashes.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you support the
system with natural modalities

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:84%
like chiropractic,
homeopathy, Chinese medicine,

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:84%
then the vitality increases as
you move upward in this spiral.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:84%
If you suppress symptoms
with over the counter meds,

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:84%
or psychotropic medications,
antibiotics, vaccinations,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
it suppresses the symptoms and
they go deeper into the body.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So you might start
with simply eczema

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and as you suppress that,
it will go towards the lungs

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:90%
and we see asthma.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The vitality is
decreased at that point

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:84%
because you're suppressing
the system trying to express

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:90%
all of these symptoms.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And you see deeper and deeper
chronic illness result.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:10%
So we might start with
eczema, but then you

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:10%
see asthma, acid reflux, then
behavioral issues, maybe ADHD

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:10%
or other spectrum disorders,
into autoimmune disorders.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:10%
And the deepest would be
neurological or mental

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:10%
illnesses.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:10%
This helix is a
great representation

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:10%
of either support to the
system expressing itself

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:10%
or expressions from the
system, causing vitality

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:10%
to be pressed down
and diminished.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:10%
>> So what happens with fear
is people are afraid of, oh

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:10%
my god, something horrible
will happen if I have a cell

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.840 align:middle line:10%
mediated response.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't know that
this is almost always

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:84%
a controlled
response of the body.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they make a horrible
mistake, which is to thwart it.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter the
technique that you thwarted.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:84%
You could give Tylenol,
or Motrin, or aspirin,

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
or stick somebody
in a cold bath.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's probably better.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But any way you thwart it is
almost always because of fear,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:90%
usually an irrational fear.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not founded
in any information

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.040 align:middle line:84%
that you're about to
have a bad outcome.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, we know
that the outcomes are worse

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:90%
if you get rid of the symptoms.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
That has been shown in study
after study for decades.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So this fear leads you to
make really horrible decisions

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:84%
about you or your
child that actually

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
make your possibility of getting
over this acute situation less

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:84%
likely and pushes you
towards chronic disease.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's a bad mistake.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:57.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Why do they worry
about diseases too much?

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:10%
When you got croup, this
is cleaning up your body.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:10%
Once a year, why
not to have a fever?

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:10%
Why not to have a cold?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:10%
Croup?

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:10%
It's a good thing,
cleansing up your body.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for fever.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for rash.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you get a
splinter in your finger

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and you don't take
it out, you get pus.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:84%
It's clear in that
example the pus is

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.600 align:middle line:90%
the therapy for this splinter.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And even most doctors
would probably

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:84%
appreciate that and not
give you an antibiotic

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:84%
because you have an
infection in your finger.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's also clear that
the only therapy for that

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.100 align:middle line:84%
is to either let the pus
get rid of the splinter

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.060 align:middle line:90%
or take the splinter out.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:84%
But then it gets more
complicated if somebody smokes.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Essentially they're putting
splinters in their lungs.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And then they get pus, which
means cough, wheeze, mucus,

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:84%
fever, which is there
to flush out the debris

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.080 align:middle line:90%
that you put in your lungs.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, that seems
to be beyond the doctors

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:90%
to understand that.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So they think that the coughing,
and the fever, and the mucus

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.760 align:middle line:84%
is a disease called bronchitis
and they give you an antibiotic

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.500 align:middle line:90%
to stop it.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Now that the repercussions
of that erroneous thinking,

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, is that
you do that twice a year

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:84%
for 20 years, which is
about average for smokers,

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and then they end
up with lung cancer.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate it's
a little simplistic

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:90%
what I'm about to say.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's basically two
causes of lung cancer.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:84%
One is you put
debris in your lungs.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And two, which is in some
ways even more important,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:84%
if somebody stopped you from
getting it out of your lungs.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.646 align:middle line:90%

Such kind of dogma or
beliefs we have to change.

a symptom is thank you God.

here's both sides
of the information.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.360 align:middle line:84%
You have one side
and this is what

you're getting predominantly.

Here's other information,
studies, and also

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.290 align:middle line:84%
resources that you can entertain
and look into for your children

before you make an
educated decision.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't believe that
we can make educated decisions

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.380 align:middle line:90%
without both sides.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So that I can decide, well,
I'm going to think about that.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm going to decide based
on my children and their health

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:90%
situations what's best for them.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, how can I
do that if I only

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.900 align:middle line:84%

feel comfortable doing?

>> You need information and
you need objective information.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.140 align:middle line:10%

there is no invested interest.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And luckily these days
with the internet,

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.640 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that kind of
information is there.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
feel like you're

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:84%
being pushed into a
certain direction,

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I think you need
to abort from that.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Look at that kind
of information where

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:84%
you can feel like this
is just information.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that is trying to push

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:90%
you one way or the other.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
that on all sides.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:84%
In that sense, homeopathy
is no different from what

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:90%
we call the allopathic world.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We're all believers and
we think we are right.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So look for that kind of
information, which has

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.840 align:middle line:90%
that kind of objectivity to it.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Which rings true to you.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.550 align:middle line:90%
The main thing is to keep quiet.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, any thought
that comes up

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.400 align:middle line:84%
in me which causes
anger, or fear,

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:84%
or whatever kind of emotion
which is not pleasant,

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:90%
I know the thought isn't true.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So I need to inquire that
thought and look what is true.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And our systems
for that, as Byron

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Katie, for instance, with the
work that many people probably

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:90%
know--

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
it's a beautiful way of looking
into those kind of things.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Like OK, you have this fear.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Make an inquiry into it and
see what is true for you.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.400 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, we see a lot of
polarization and we see a lot

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:10%
of fear happening.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:10%
We see a lot of defensiveness.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And to the question, how
do you fight the fear,

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's the
correct question because you

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:90%
don't want to fight it.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Resist not evil is a
very wise statement.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you resist it,
you're in the same energy of it.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And so then you didn't
do anything, but just

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.750 align:middle line:90%
join the energy.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.180 align:middle line:84%
You can't get out
of that energy.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Einstein says you
can't solve a problem

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:84%
at the same level of thinking
that you're stuck in.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:84%
We've got to find times
and places to be still.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn to
respect each other.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.070 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
sayings is from Einstein.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "The
greatest decision

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
we will ever make
in our lives is

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:84%
whether we perceive we
live in a hostile world,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:84%
or a happy world, or
a friendly universe."

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.170 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:14:55.170 --> 00:15:00.510 align:middle line:84%
That decision is
moment to moment.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Every second of our lives
we make that decision.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Is it hostile or are
they out to get me?

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Or no, what's the gift in this?

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.599 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:15:10.599 --> 00:15:11.640 align:middle line:90%
What's the new adventure?

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:90%
What's the fun?

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:19.980 align:middle line:84%
We make that choice to perceive
outside of ourselves what's

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And we can flip, you
know, like a dime.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But if we're
conscious that we are

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:84%
the ones who make that
choice of perception,

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.482 align:middle line:90%
the whole world opens.

from within you based on what

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:10%

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.870 align:middle line:10%
by the periphery.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:84%
But I really, truly believe
that there's a better way.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that, as humans,
we are absolutely designed

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:90%
to work in synergy with nature.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And that It's a perfect balance
and perfect relationship.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe
that the human body

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:84%
is designed to work in
nature with perfect harmony.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> As a human, we are
given the ability to heal.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:84%
It's within us when there's
things out of balance.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And so in my practice I
call that the whisper.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
If you listen to those whispers
and you balance the body

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.640 align:middle line:84%
from those places,
then you never

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:90%
have to hear the body scream.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.315 align:middle line:84%
And so we look at the scream
in naturopathic medicine

00:16:41.315 --> 00:16:42.115 align:middle line:90%
as disease.

00:16:42.115 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.880 align:middle line:84%
The most gratifying
thing about my practice

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:84%
is being able to help
families listen to the whisper

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.520 align:middle line:84%
so that it doesn't
get to a point

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.570 align:middle line:84%
where their body is screaming
with disease or imbalance.

says, this baby

that from fear?

fear telling you
to do something,

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:84%
or your intuition telling
you to do something?

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:84%
This is what I say to my
patients all the time.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:84%
They're depending on me
to give them answers,

but answers lie within them.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:90%
I can be a support system.

I can be a cheerleader.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:90%
I can be a guide along the way.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:84%

listening to their inner voice.

>> Yeah, that's that
gut, that gut feeling.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:84%
What I've learned, I think,
experience fuels intuition.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:53.060 align:middle line:84%
But being able to
remove the hysteria,

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and hone in on your experience,
and then come from that space

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.640 align:middle line:84%
is really about
finding that intuition.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:84%
But what I've learned
is the paranoid thought

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:10.070 align:middle line:84%
that gets stuck on a
reel is not intuition.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the fear-based.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What I tell my kids or what
I told them when they were

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:16.590 align:middle line:90%
little.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:10%
I said, right here
you have some fur.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:90%
It's fur, OK?

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Just like a cat has fur.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And you know when you rub a
cat in the direction of the fur

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.670 align:middle line:90%
it's smooth.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you rub a cat
in the other direction,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:90%
oh, it kind of bristles.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I said right in here
you have that fir.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.350 align:middle line:90%
And so go to it all the time.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.516 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you, as
parents, go to the fir.

00:18:44.516 --> 00:18:49.100 align:middle line:84%
For all the decisions that
you have, feel the fur.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:84%
It's deeper than the
outside contrived fear.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:90%
It's inherent within you.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Is the fur rubbing in
the right direction?

00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:90%
Is it bristling?

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Stop, look, listen,
find out more.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you can apply
that with your children,

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
with all your choices, with
your decisions, things go well.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:90%

>> When I was 16, my mother
was diagnosed with cancer.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And she proceeded to embark
on chemotherapy, radiation,

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:90%
the conventional treatment.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
my sister started

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:90%
exploring natural medicine.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Vitamins, supplements, and it
wasn't very popular back then.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:90%
This is in the 1970s.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So she would drive
my mother everyday

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:03.040 align:middle line:84%
to her chemo or
radiation treatments

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and wait for her in the car
and my mother would come out.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And my sister started
giving my mother

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.820 align:middle line:90%
vitamins and supplements.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:10%
And she was rallying.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.080 align:middle line:10%
She was doing great.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:10%
And her doctors were saying,
you're doing fabulous.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.860 align:middle line:90%
You're doing very well.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, in her
innocence, said, yeah,

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
my daughter's giving
me supplements.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And her doctor said
to her, you have

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to stop that right away
because that's interfering

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:90%
with your treatment.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:84%
My mother came out of that
treatment crying and explaining

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:90%
to my sister what had happened.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And of course, she stopped
all her supplements.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And about three weeks
later, she was dead.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So her death was the
beginning of my awareness

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:90%
that there is another way.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.297 align:middle line:90%
There isn't only one way.

00:20:50.297 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I just think it's really
important for people to know

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:10%
that the other way to conquer
fear is love and love is

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:10%
the only thing more
powerful than fear.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:10%
And I think that if people are
loved when they are cared for

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:10%
or loved when they're
treated, that they will

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:10%
see a much more healing
response and environment

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:10%
internally and externally and
make it a lot easier for them

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.670 align:middle line:10%
to go into a healing state.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So real immunity
is something that I

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:84%
am very passionate
about for all people.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful
that you were

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:90%

>> What's the best
practitioner for you?

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of them is sitting
right next to me right now.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, I have found a
lot of wisdom in your advice.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, you're right,
I do take everyone's advice.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.110 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest piece is that
finding the right practitioner

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle line:84%
has to do where you
are as a parent.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we had
spoken one time, remember,

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and I had said that I
realize I'm their healer.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.750 align:middle line:90%
My boys, I am their healer.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I am the person to process
this information for them

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:90%
and give them what they need.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And not to just hand
them over willingly

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:84%
to someone who doesn't have an
invested interest in my child.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:90%
They may.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:90%
It may be of different interest.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, they're
not the one holding them

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:90%

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Very scary.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:90%
They're just not.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:90%
It's me.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:90%
So the best practitioner.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:90%
One who listens, of course.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
One who is going
to be straight up

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.570 align:middle line:90%
about what they have to offer.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:84%
One who talks openly
about the side effects

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.030 align:middle line:90%
of what they're offering.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:90%
One who is open to modality.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And rather than giving
me the, well, I've

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.700 align:middle line:90%
heard it works a little bit.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Instead of giving me that, they
gave me the, you know what?

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.860 align:middle line:84%
You're his mother and
you know what's best.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like you're
well-informed about this.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:10%
That was a switch
where I thought,

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.660 align:middle line:10%
this is a practitioner
who is listening,

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:10%
who's paying attention.

the fact that I

You're the ideal client because
you take responsibility.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Because you listen
to your intuition.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And you make some
decisions on your own.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And you reach out
for the support

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:84%
that you need without expecting

Doesn't matter

I'm going to tell you
what your condition is.

I'm going to tell you
which medicine will relieve

not going to heal you,

to fix your symptoms so you'll

feel better.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:10%
as you think is fair because
we have a broken health care

system.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:10%
And then you move on.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.980 align:middle line:10%

a doctor, at least

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.847 align:middle line:10%
when I made the decision
to become a doctor,

00:24:10.847 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:10%

was about healing.

I thought it was about

that.

00:25:26.812 --> 00:25:28.520 align:middle line:84%
We don't want people
to be afraid to talk

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
about their needs, to
talk about their journey,

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.060 align:middle line:84%
or to talk about their
goals for health.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.084 align:middle line:84%
And if their goals
or their needs

00:25:34.084 --> 00:25:35.750 align:middle line:84%
are different from
what I was expecting,

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.550 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be OK, too.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And so we serve with a humble
heart, which is number two.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:90%
We're an ego-free clinic.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.442 align:middle line:84%
Everybody that works
here has enough training

00:25:45.442 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and enough experience
to have the biggest

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.390 align:middle line:90%
ego that you would ever meet.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:50.015 align:middle line:84%
But that's a requirement
to being here.

00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:51.447 align:middle line:90%
That you have to be humble.

00:25:51.447 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to check
the ego at the door.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Had some brilliant practitioners
that interviewed with me,

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:84%
but the ego was what kept
them from working here.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.250 align:middle line:84%
The fourth thing that
we do is that we're

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.166 align:middle line:90%
a values-based clinic.

00:26:00.166 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So we all align--
everyone who works here

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:90%
are aligned to their values.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And the outcome of our
values is that we're

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.302 align:middle line:90%
going to love our patients.

00:26:06.302 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:90%
And we have great news.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:90%
It's unconditional love.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.613 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to love us back.

00:26:09.613 --> 00:26:12.466 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:12.466 --> 00:26:21.270 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.410 align:middle line:90%
So we do four things different.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:84%
We have patients that drive
quite a ways to come here.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen some
of those tears.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:84%
We have one mom that drove
nine hours to come here.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
She had written off
Western medicine forever.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
She was never going
to go back to an--

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:90%
certainly not a pediatrician.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Her child was vaccine
injured and her doctor

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.870 align:middle line:90%
didn't believe her.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:45.350 align:middle line:84%
They witnessed regression
into autism after vaccines.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:48.790 align:middle line:84%
A perfectly healthy
child, autism.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.467 align:middle line:90%
And she was done with doctors.

00:26:50.467 --> 00:26:52.550 align:middle line:84%
But she heard about our
clinic and made the drive.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And I still remember
walking into the room

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.200 align:middle line:90%
and she just burst into tears.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I figured it's because I was
late or something was wrong.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Just a relief to
have a safe place.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.208 align:middle line:84%
So you said a couple of things
that really resonate with me

00:27:04.208 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:84%
because as homeopaths
what we're trained to do

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.520 align:middle line:90%
is be unbiased observers.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And with that
unbiased observation,

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:90%
we don't make any judgments.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't have an agenda for
how a person is supposed

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:84%
to heal because we don't
know at the front end what's

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.150 align:middle line:90%
meant to be.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So when you can have that
unbiased observation,

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:31.690 align:middle line:84%
you can be present with
that unconditional love.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's what attracts
people to your clinic.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And I know some of my patients
who do drive hours to see you.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So what do you
receive from that when

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.550 align:middle line:90%
you give that kind of care?

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.350 align:middle line:90%
What's it do for you?

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether it's the right
place or time to say it.

00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:53.210 align:middle line:10%
Recognizing how important
it is that we all

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.660 align:middle line:10%
work together and respect
each other as professionals,

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:10%
I think, is my hope for
the future of health care.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.957 align:middle line:84%
Recognizing that it's OK
that things I don't know.

00:28:01.957 --> 00:28:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I know things
that you don't know.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:04.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know or not.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.431 align:middle line:84%
Probably not with you
because of your experience,

00:28:06.431 --> 00:28:08.600 align:middle line:84%
but other providers
in the community.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.750 align:middle line:84%
If we can complement
each other, then we're

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:90%
providing real health care.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Some of our mutual patients
that we have and we've both

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.455 align:middle line:90%
seen that.

00:28:15.455 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:84%
That they're better because
they're working with us

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.710 align:middle line:90%
and we're working together.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:21.920 align:middle line:90%
I love seeing those outcomes.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.830 align:middle line:90%

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:84%

in the right capacity, right?

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Rather than coming
from a place of fear,

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:56.070 align:middle line:84%
you kind of look at it from
rather than a real focused

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:84%
space, you kind of
move back up outwards

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and you look at it
from a, I don't want

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:90%
to say objective point of view.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But you kind of
remove the hysteria.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:10.740 align:middle line:90%
You remove any of self-doubt.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.664 align:middle line:90%
And you look at your tools.

00:29:12.664 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:90%
So you've come up from here.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.192 align:middle line:90%

of all life, including

we've assumed that
we are superior.

doing something in the same
