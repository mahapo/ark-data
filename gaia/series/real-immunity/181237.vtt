00:00:33.932 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:10%
>> I was born an
homeopathic family member.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:10%
My father was a
homeopathic doctor,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:10%
so I grew up with homeopathy
and prophylactics.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.190 align:middle line:10%
Homeopathic prophylaxis
was just part of my life.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:10%
There were no other options.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:10%
>> We didn't vaccinate
our children,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:10%
and we didn't even speak
about the topic because it was

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.660 align:middle line:10%
so clear for us that we
didn't want to vaccinate them.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:10%
But then we realized that
the children of our friends

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:10%
got seriously sick
after the vaccination.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:10%
And then we started to
do something about it.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.810 align:middle line:10%
We started to treat
the vaccine victims,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.810 align:middle line:10%
and then we started
to train people

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:10%
in how to protect your children,
vaccine free for from diseases.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:10%
And we started that--

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.335 align:middle line:10%
>> In the 1980s.

00:01:27.335 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.770 align:middle line:10%
We were not aware
about the need when

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:10%
we started to get children.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:10%
But then the reality was
different than our thinking.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.860 align:middle line:10%
And we wrote lots
of books about it,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:10%
how to protect your
children with homeopathy.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:10%
Altogether we wrote
four books mainly

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:10%
with the subject
about protection.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:10%
In all other books, and we
have written about 20 books

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:10%
as a homeopathic guides,
we mention the possibility

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:10%
of protecting yourself
with homeopathy.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:10%
And now rediscovered
a new method,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:10%
a little bit like homeopathy,
but it is with flower chakra

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:10%
essences, and they are
also a tremendous help

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:10%
to detect vaccine damages.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.550 align:middle line:10%
With homeopathy it's a booster
to activate the immune system.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:10%
>> We have reached thousands
and thousands of people on this

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:10%
subject of homeoprophylaxis,
through us and through

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.270 align:middle line:10%
our students and
through our books.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:10%
The first book which we wrote
was a homeopathic travelers

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:10%
guide, and that has sold over
100,000 copies until now.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:10%
>> And many institutions,
groups, schools,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:10%
and so we have reached
maybe a million people.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:10%
>> The city we live in, the
place we live in is called

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:10%
Murnau, and it is the city where
the least people get themselves

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:10%
vaccinated, the most conscious
city about vaccination.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.372 align:middle line:10%
And it is called "The
City of Healers" now.

00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:10.405 align:middle line:10%
>> We are very proud to
be a part of this country.

00:03:10.405 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:10%
I would like to
add that people who

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:10%
take the homeopathic
prophylaxis are

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:10%
in general very healthy
against all kinds of diseases,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:10%
and very happy and--

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:10%
it's different kind of people.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:10%
And we also see in
families, as people tell us,

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.275 align:middle line:10%
that when parents have
vaccinated their first child,

00:03:38.275 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:10%
or their first children,
and then they stop that,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:10%
and the others take the
homeopathic treatment,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:10%
has a tremendous difference in
the health of these children.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:10%
And nowadays there
are the children

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:10%
who show their parents
through their diseases

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:10%
which way they should go.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:10%
And we want to support these
incoming generation to grow up

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:10%
healthy on this planet.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:10%
This our wish.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:27.523 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most wonderful
parts of my journey in this

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:10%
since 1985, was the time that
I spent with the Cuban doctors

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:10%
and scientists, the
collaboration with

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:10%
the professionals from the
Finlay Institute in Havana,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:10%
which is the Institute
actually responsible for making

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.626 align:middle line:10%
vaccines, but also for
controlling infectious disease

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:10%
outbreaks throughout
the country.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It started in 2008,
where they invited me

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
to a conference
in Havana to talk

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:90%
about homeopathic immunization.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was, of course,
a real surprise.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I had no idea
what they were doing.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:10%
So I basically got up and
presented my two talks,

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.150 align:middle line:10%
and then the Cubans got up.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And to my absolute amazement
and joy, I can say,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.700 align:middle line:84%
they talked about the use
of homeopathic immunization

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:84%
to prevent leptospirosis, which
was a real problem in Cuba

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
at the time, seasonal
problem, hurricane

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:84%
season, to prevent leptospirosis
in over 2.2 million people.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So typically, in the
hurricane season,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
we find that the eastern
side of Cuba is worst hit.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was in 2007
and also in 2008.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So they presented mainly the
2007 data at that conference.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the 2008 data
is even more impressive.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, I was like
a kid in a lolly shop.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I'd been dealing with thousands
of families, thousands

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:84%
of interventions, and
here were the Cubans

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:90%
talking about millions.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So I went back again to Cuba in
2010, 2012, and 2014, working

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
principally with Dr.
Gustavo Bracho, who

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
was vice president of
the Finlay Institute, who

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:84%
was the person mainly in charge
of the homeopathic immunization

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:84%
programs, but also with Dr.
Concepcion Campa Huergo,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.360 align:middle line:84%
the president of Finlay, a
most wonderful person, the most

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:90%
wonderful humanitarian.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I used to think
of her, actually,

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.990 align:middle line:90%
as the Mother Teresa of Havana.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:84%
She was just absolutely
selfless in what

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:90%
she gave to the community.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And she was the one,
with Dr. Bracho,

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.800 align:middle line:84%
who were instigating these
massive immunization programs.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
The largest one in
Cuba was in 2010

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
when the government instructed
Findley Institute to immunize

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:84%
the whole country over 12 months
of age, 9.8 million people,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:84%
against swine flu when that big
scare hit the planet in 2010.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were hardly any
cases or deaths from swine flu.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, what they did,

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:84%
they also immunized against
pneumococcal disease.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And when Bracho and
I plotted the data,

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.960 align:middle line:84%
we saw that there was
a level of disease,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:84%
2010 had drop dramatically,
came back up again in 2011,

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:90%
and proceeded onwards.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:84%
So it showed, unambiguously,
that the intervention

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:84%
against pneumococcal
disease was very successful.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.970 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't tell how
successful the intervention

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
against swine flu was,
because even though they only

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:84%
had very, very few
cases, we didn't

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.620 align:middle line:84%
know how many people brought
the disease into the country

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:90%
and what the spread was like.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:10%
>> We didn't like the reaction
that Asher, our eldest,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.850 align:middle line:10%
who was born prematurely,
was having to conventional

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:10%
vaccines.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:10%
So we did several of
them and then we stopped,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:10%
and I thought,
well, what do we do?

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I know I can't
continue, because we

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.380 align:middle line:84%
don't like seeing the
response he was getting,

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.810 align:middle line:84%
but we knew we had
to do something

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
because we felt responsible,
as like a collective whole,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
that we should be
doing something.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I like the idea that
there is a full program, too,

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:84%
so there was a clearing
of the vaccine out,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and then there was the
bringing in of the HP program,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and it was a full system, and
we could go from start to finish

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:84%
with one thing, and we're
still protecting our children

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
and doing the things that
we feel necessary, too,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:90%
not just not doing anything.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that I was very--

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I had my doubts at first,
maybe a little bit, as well.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit?

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.184 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.184 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Growing up, we
went to the doctor,

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and what the doctor
said is what you did.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I still feel like
that's hard for me

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
to overcome sometimes, because
that's 40 years of doing that.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what you do.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:10%
And we still go to the doctor
for if you break an arm,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.644 align:middle line:10%
or you know, things like that,
where it's not anti-doctor

00:09:54.644 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:10%
or anything like that.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:90%
But I've seen homeopathics work.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Ear infection for
Leo, I think it was?

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Was one of the first ones.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And you know, he's starting
to be in pain and cry,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:90%
and Andrea picked out--

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and maybe she
called you-- she was

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:84%
able to pick out the right
remedy and give it to him,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:90%
and it stopped.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very cut and dry
pretty much that way.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.585 align:middle line:90%
So then let's try again.

00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, then it worked
again, and then you

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:84%
start to actually
understand it more

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and look into it more and
believe it more, and so

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.456 align:middle line:90%
that's where we're at now.

00:10:32.456 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I'd say I was a
little bit hesitant at first.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, hesitant is
not strong enough.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:84%
He was hands down
not on board at all.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%
It was some drag out, like, it
was drag out fighting, arguing.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
I had to find evidence.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:90%
I had to find information.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> This like, mother intuition
for him wasn't floating it.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:90%
Like it wasn't enough for him.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Although, if I push hard
enough it would've been enough.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
But with your class and with the
information I was able to find,

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.590 align:middle line:84%
he slowly, very
slowly, opened up

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.880 align:middle line:90%
to the idea of using homeopathy.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:90%
It all feels right.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a moment of
hesitation when it happens.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Oh, when I was at
your class, yes.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I was there listening
to describe health

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and being stuck in
that healing loop,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that that's where
our first son was stuck in.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Every time he was inoculated,
there was a healing loop,

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and he'd go and he'd get
stuck, and he'd get stuck,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and he'd get stuck.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle line:90%
And it described it perfectly.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And so now we also see things
that we speak of are healing,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.340 align:middle line:84%
or whatever comes up, whatever
illness or little cold,

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:84%
which aren't many, we
do see that process.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And we see full healing
and full circle,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
which I think that was
that big moment where

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I remember seeing on
the board that circle,

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, and it had
a center in there,

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.098 align:middle line:84%
and that's what it was,
I think, that completion.

00:12:14.098 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I think the biggest
part is actually

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:84%
understanding what disease
is, and understanding

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.410 align:middle line:84%
our immune system,
and what that means,

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and how they interact
together, and how

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.690 align:middle line:84%
it's a transference of
information between disease

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.460 align:middle line:90%
and immune system.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's all about that process.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
It's about that building up
that strong adult in many ways,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
not only just emotionally
and having a good family,

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
good sound family, but having
a strong immune system.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've had parents ask me
before what homeoprophylaxis

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:84%
is, and it's real
simple what homeopathy--

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:90%
it's an energetic left--

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.391 align:middle line:84%
you know, the residue
left on a nosode,

00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
it's introduced
energetically to the body,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
the body receives
that information,

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
it reacts to the information,
it builds its own immune system

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
in response to it without
any other extra adjuvants

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:84%
or any other, I guess,
what do you want to say,

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:84%
chemicals, that are
irritating the system.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And people somewhat--
they get it.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And usually parents
who ask me are

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.910 align:middle line:84%
parents because they're
there and they're

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.420 align:middle line:90%
ready for the information.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're not there and you're
not ready for the information,

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.800 align:middle line:90%
it falls on deaf ears.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.554 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the biggest thing.

00:13:37.554 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think there is a thing, you
know, if you see a chiropractor

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.595 align:middle line:84%
and you're eating
organic, you're

00:13:41.595 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:90%
ready to hear the information.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:90%
That's not always true.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But it gets you closer to that
point where you can hear it,

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:90%
you can listen to it.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.258 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be like,
oh, OK, it makes sense.

00:13:51.258 --> 00:13:52.058 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:52.058 --> 00:13:57.806 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.806 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:10%
>> I wanted to explore
the HP program because I

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.580 align:middle line:10%
wasn't totally satisfied with
the safety of the vaccines

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.660 align:middle line:10%
and the research for that.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:10%
So I wanted to find and explore
some alternative solutions

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.545 align:middle line:10%
for our family.

00:14:12.545 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the reason
why I wasn't on board was

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:84%
because there was much research
out there about having vaccines

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.600 align:middle line:84%
that I just felt more
comfortable with it.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:84%
But then I think there
was a gut feeling where

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Helen was so certain that we
wanted to go unvaccinated,

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:84%
because we were really confident
with the amount of research

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:84%
that was out there
about vaccine safety.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we were always
exploring different ways

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that we were
building our immunity

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and then also making
sure that we were

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.580 align:middle line:90%
building Zach's immunity, too.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.497 align:middle line:84%
>> What took for me was really
just Helen's confidence.

00:14:53.497 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:84%
She was the one that
was doing the research,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.996 align:middle line:84%
and she was the one
that was making sure

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that she was going out
and kind of digging

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:84%
deep until all these
different vaccines,

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.201 align:middle line:84%
and then also, what's
the alternative

00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:06.050 align:middle line:90%
to building the immunity.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.754 align:middle line:84%
I pretty much pushed the
research over to her,

00:15:09.754 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and so she was one that was
making all the decisions

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.410 align:middle line:90%
about our family's health.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.386 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.386 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So what made me go
with HP program is first,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:84%
I like that there was no risk
associated with the HP program.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It's very gentle, very
safe, but you still

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:84%
get the benefits of
educating the immune system.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who, she did
the HP program with all three

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:84%
of her children, and they're
so healthy and happy.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:90%
It's so nice to see.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:90%
So I heard about the HP program.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do more
research on it.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I found out there were
so many other countries that

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:84%
use the HP program, that
helped me solidify my decision.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.110 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
We definitely got a lot
of support from you,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and it was very clear,
the instructions how

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
to give it to my
son, at what time,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
like the timing,
the schedule of it.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.040 align:middle line:90%
He absolutely loves taking them.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I call them the
little snowman food.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So he asks for
them all the time.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.585 align:middle line:90%
He loves it.

00:16:19.585 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it was more
about the certainty of it.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I can remember
Zach having 105 fever,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and we're thinking about
like, what do we do?

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was Helen's
level of certainty and kind

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:84%
of having a method
to go to, was really

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:84%
kind of why we
decided to go with HP.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>> But having that support from
you was super important when he

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:84%
did get sick and get
the cold and the flu.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.950 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:90%
He's super healthy.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:90%
He's happy.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:10%
Even if he has a cold
he's still playing.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And he's in school, and he
doesn't get sick very much

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.560 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:84%
To other parents, I would
say, do your research.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:84%
Find some other parents who
have gone through the HP program

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:17.359 align:middle line:84%
with their children, and
ask lots of questions

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and then make a
decision for yourself,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and not to be
scared if you choose

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.409 align:middle line:90%
the non-conventional way.

00:17:26.409 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So my level of fear
surrounding being a parent has

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:90%
significantly gone down.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to have somebody
who is so confident in HP

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:40.121 align:middle line:84%
and has done her
research, that it kind of

00:17:40.121 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:90%
gives me a level of certainty.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I would have caved
if it wasn't for her really

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:84%
going and doing her research and
working with you to make sure

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.670 align:middle line:84%
that, you know,
that Zach is kind

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:56.125 align:middle line:84%
of having this kind of method
of robust kind of study

00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:90%
that has been around.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So we feel like we are being
proactive about his immunity,

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and not just sitting back and
waiting for things to happen,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle line:84%
even though we chose not
to vaccinate our son.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:84%
We have a baby coming
in June, and we've

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.440 align:middle line:84%
decided to go ahead with the
HP program with this baby yet

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:84%
We really have more confidence
in our body's natural ability

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:84%
to heal and overcome
disease, and really

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
build that real immunity
up for the baby.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Parents are always asking me
why homeoprophylaxis isn't more

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:10%
utilized since it's
safe and effective.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
There are many answers,
and Dr. Isaac Golden

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:90%
will address some of them.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But I can speak
to the resistance

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:90%
from classical homeopaths.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a well
used method we all

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:84%
use as classical homeopaths, and
it's called genus epidemicus.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
When there's a disease
outbreak or an epidemic,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:84%
we look at what remedies
most effectively treat

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.190 align:middle line:90%
the symptoms of that disease.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Then we're able to
distribute that remedy,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's called the
genus epidemicus.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
This method has been used
for cholera, typhoid,

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and most recently, for the
Spanish flu in 1918, 1919.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Classical homeopaths sometimes
contend that genus epidemicus

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.940 align:middle line:84%
is the only classical
method to use,

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.750 align:middle line:84%
that HP, homeoprophylaxis,
is not classical.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Genus epidemicus is a great
method, and very effective.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:84%
But what if someone can't
withstand a disease?

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:90%
What about the weakest among us?

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.780 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it better to be proactive?

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And homeoprophylaxis
can be just this.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:10%
One of the main reasons
why homeopathy is not

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:10%
used more in general
for treatment, but also

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:10%
in particular for
disease prevention,

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:10%
like homeoprophylaxis,
is simply because

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:10%
of the intense resistance by
the pharmaceutical industry

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.220 align:middle line:10%
and its minions
around the world,

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:10%
including in my own
country, Australia,

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:10%
against any form
of natural medicine

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:10%
which doesn't really
bring them in a dollar.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, that may sound like a
conspiracy theory to some,

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
but it's been proven by esteemed
researchers time and time

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:36.570 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, there are
very deliberate attempts

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:84%
to marginalize all forms
of natural therapies.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Homeopathy is, of course,
one of the easiest targets

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:90%
to start with.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we prepare medicines
past Avogadro's number,

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:84%
past the point where
there are molecules

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.180 align:middle line:90%
of the original material left.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So you know, for
an orthodox person

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, there's
nothing there.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:90%
How can nothing work?

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:90%
It's an easy target.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, we know, in
natural therapies in general,

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.150 align:middle line:84%
that we are more than
just our physical selves.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:90%
There is an emotional self.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.880 align:middle line:90%
There's an intellectual self.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.330 align:middle line:90%
And God only knows what else.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:36.452 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.452 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:10%
>> The lectures that I've heard
on homeoprophylaxis have been

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.430 align:middle line:10%
compelling.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:10%
They're fascinating.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:10%
And particularly,
I was introduced

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:10%
to the Cuban experience of using
homeoprophylaxis for prevention

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.050 align:middle line:10%
of infectious disease there by
the public health doctors, who

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:10%
came to this
naturally skeptical,

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.136 align:middle line:10%
and invested in vaccines,
which they didn't

00:22:00.136 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:10%
have available at the time.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to defer to
some other way of protecting

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:90%
the population, and it worked.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And it worked
specifically, and best,

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.876 align:middle line:84%
in those who had received
the homeoprophylaxis.

00:22:11.876 --> 00:22:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So I found that
absolutely fascinating.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.260 align:middle line:84%
It's always much more
interesting, more compelling,

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.020 align:middle line:84%
when you have skeptics
dragged kicking and screaming

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to something and
saying, wow, that's

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.372 align:middle line:90%
really interesting that worked.

00:22:23.372 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, not being
allowed to continue to do it,

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.940 align:middle line:84%
because it's in conflict with
the pharmaceutical industry's

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:90%
interests.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.407 align:middle line:84%
There's no money
in home prophylaxis

00:22:31.407 --> 00:22:32.740 align:middle line:90%
for the pharmaceutical industry.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So I am fascinated
by the concept.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's
almost impossible

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.890 align:middle line:84%
to define how it works,
because it's probably

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:90%
sufficient to say it work.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not inducing antibodies.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not inducing, as
far as one's aware,

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:90%
cell mediated immunity.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:84%
But what it is doing is, in a
statistically significant way,

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.745 align:middle line:84%
protecting a population
from infectious disease.

00:23:01.745 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we don't
know all the answers.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And understanding of infant
immunity and immunity

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:84%
in general is still
in its nascency.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we're trying
to judge it according

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:90%
to our current understanding.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.370 align:middle line:90%
We may be missing the point.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Much more important,
pragmatically,

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.861 align:middle line:90%
is that it's working.

00:23:25.861 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Unfortunately, now in Cuba,
particularly with the passing

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:10%
of Fidel, who was very, very
supportive of complementary

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:40.830 align:middle line:10%
medicine, and who is a very
dear friend with Dr. Campa,

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:46.320 align:middle line:10%
the Cuban HP program
is now on hold.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And Finlay Institute
has reverted back

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.840 align:middle line:84%
to mainly being a
vaccine manufacturer.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
what the future

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:90%
will hold for HP in Cuba.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Of course, god willing, I hope
they will pick it up again.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Because it was such a great
success, and virtually no risk,

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and very, very little expense
to the whole Cuban community.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.736 align:middle line:90%
But time will tell.

00:24:14.736 --> 00:24:22.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Integrity is coming from
a place of authenticity,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:10%
a place of truth as
you understand it.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I think, a deeper aspect
of that word or concept

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.752 align:middle line:84%
is recognizing that
truth is relative.

00:24:36.752 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that with regard

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.685 align:middle line:84%
to the vaccine
controversy is this

00:24:39.685 --> 00:24:44.420 align:middle line:84%
is not just a black and
white question of, oh, now

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.760 align:middle line:90%
you know you've been lied.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.502 align:middle line:90%
Now what's going on?

00:24:47.502 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, a small number
of committed people,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:84%
whether they sought
to be martyrs or not,

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:84%
risked doing so by
standing up, speaking out.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And each time
another person does

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.510 align:middle line:84%
that, a small group of
people who wanted to

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:05.570 align:middle line:84%
but really couldn't, now have
the strength to join them.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And when they do that,
a bigger group who

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:12.210 align:middle line:84%
wasn't ready to go there until
the smaller group did it,

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:90%
stand up.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're seeing now.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the snowball
effect, if you will.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Awareness is growing.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.072 align:middle line:84%
And to use the snowball metaphor
again, we're pushing it uphill,

00:25:22.072 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and it's a hard push
right now, but we're

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:90%
getting close to the top.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.284 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, we're
going to push it over the top

00:25:29.284 --> 00:25:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and gravity is
going to take over.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:43.768 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.768 --> 00:25:47.890 align:middle line:10%
>> I hope you've gained a
deeper understanding about what

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:10%
homeoprophylaxis is, how
it's applied, who's using it,

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:10%
and what kinds of
studies have been done.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly, I hope
you've gained an understanding

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:84%
about how safe and
effective it is,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and how respected it
is in many countries.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to share the next
film with you in the "Real

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Immunity Series,"
and it's called

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.430 align:middle line:90%
"Choosing Real Immunity."

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.790 align:middle line:10%
We'll hear from holistic
pediatricians Janet Levitan

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:10%
and Linda Baker, Jeanne Ohm,
the CEO of the International

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.020 align:middle line:10%
Chiropractic
Pediatric Association,

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:10%
and Del Bigtree will be back
talking about what fear can do.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.160 align:middle line:10%
Torako Yui, whom you saw
in the first film, who

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:10%
has trained hundreds
of homeopaths in Japan,

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:10%
will share her personal
path of choosing homeopathy.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.770 align:middle line:10%
Andreas Bachmair, Sally
Fallon, and Jerry Johnson

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:10%
will tell us how they're
moving health freedom forward

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:10%
in their own work.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:10%
You'll meet Dr. Angie Graper,
a functional chiropractor,

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:10%
and also Lauren Hubele,
an expert in gemotherapy.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.420 align:middle line:10%
You'll listen in as Paola
Brown, the president

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.260 align:middle line:10%
of Americans For Homeopathy
Choice, chats with me.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, we'll take a look
at the role consciousness

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:84%
plays in our ability
to make choices.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Join me soon for
choosing real immunity.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:29:01.696 align:middle line:90%
