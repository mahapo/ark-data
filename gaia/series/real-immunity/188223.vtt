00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:10%
>> So, levels of consciousness,
I like to talk about them

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:10%
in terms of levels
of understanding.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:84%
A level of consciousness can
be viewed as the understanding

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.730 align:middle line:84%
that we've been able to come
to thus far in our lives.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So at a certain
point in my life--

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I you'd always like to
use myself as an example--

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:90%
is I was very angry, right?

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a lot of antagonists
all over the place.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I could recognize them
very quickly and easily.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.410 align:middle line:84%
The level of
understanding that I

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:84%
had come to at that
point in my life

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:84%
was that these
antagonists are very real.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't see them,
you're not seeing reality.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
For me, people that were
seeing things and saying they

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
were rosy, and
things were perfect,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I always considered
them to be people

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.490 align:middle line:84%
that are going to get
punked, where they're

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
going to have a lot of
problems because they're going

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:90%
to get victimized in some way.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, though, that
each level of consciousness

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:84%
carries with it a
different reality.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And until you change your mind
and get a new understanding,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.500 align:middle line:84%
that new reality just doesn't
exist, or it seems false.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
These go for a sense
of reality that

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:84%
is below our level of
understanding-- for example,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.580 align:middle line:84%
if you're at the level of
understanding of shame,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and I look at you,
I'm at the level

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:84%
of anger, which is a little
bit higher than that.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And you say, gosh,
why are you in shame,

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:84%
you have no reason to
do that, forget them,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.090 align:middle line:90%
that type of thing.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So what's below me
seems ridiculous,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:90%
and what's above me as well.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's say someone who would
be forgiving, if you're

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
someone who's in anger, and
you look at forgiving people

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle line:84%
as, boy, that's really stupid,
because you know what they're

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:90%
going to do to you again.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.248 align:middle line:84%
So that's how the levels
of consciousness work.

Dr. David Hawkins did
great work on something

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.550 align:middle line:10%
that he calls levels
of consciousness.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:84%
He started off by
doing muscle testing

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:84%
to kind of validate
the different findings

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:90%
that he would come up with.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.710 align:middle line:10%
It starts off at
a level of shame.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:10%
This is the very
lowest level of energy.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:10%
You have so low energy,
and shame, and humiliation,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:10%
that this is where a lot
of suicides take place.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:10%
It goes up from shame, guilt,
grief, fear, anger, desire,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:10%
and then pride, which
interestingly enough

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:10%
is how we see things
in the United States,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:10%
is that's kind of the
highest level is pride.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
threshold at which

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
something huge happens, when we
go from fear to power or love.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And this change-- he gave
a numeric value to each one

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.410 align:middle line:90%
of these--

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
it starts off at about 20,
and then it goes up to 50.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:10%
And then at about
level 200 is pride.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And this is a logarithmic scale.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So every jump up in
one number is worth

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:84%
an awful lot of additional
power, if we will.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:84%
When we cross over
beyond the fear

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
base or all the willful
things that happen below 200,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:84%
we start to engage in a world
that's more synchronistic.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:10%
Below 200, all of the
things that happen

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:10%
are happened by effort, force
of will, or it happened to me--

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:10%
either I'm doing it or
somebody is doing it to me.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:26.770 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:10%
>> The only way we have a
chance is if God is with us,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:10%
that if there's something bigger
than all of us going on here.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:10%
And so though this
moment seems scary,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:10%
or this could
undermine us, I have

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:10%
to assume that
that, too, is God.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I use a little
rougher language.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
But I would say, either God
is with us or we are screwed.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's just the--

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and so every time it looked
like something was going wrong,

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I just said, this
too must be God,

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
it's going to take.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:90%
And I think that fear--

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.737 align:middle line:90%
what did I fear?

00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:03.070 align:middle line:90%
I didn't fear making the choice.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But I will say
there were times--

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.700 align:middle line:90%
I think I come across--

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and I am a pretty
calm, relaxed guy.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time, I
think I had panic attacks,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:90%
like a couple of times.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Right when the movie
was about to come out,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and then when it came out,
I'd be landing in the airport

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:84%
or driving, and suddenly it
was like this black fluid

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:84%
ran from the top my
head down on my feet.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Like I would be suddenly
just filled with fear--

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:84%
they're watching me,
I'm putting my family

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:84%
at risk, all of sort of
those thoughts, to the point

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.252 align:middle line:84%
where I remember,
once, I was in my car.

00:06:39.252 --> 00:06:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I had to get off the road, and
pull over, and just breathe.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
what is going on?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And I look at the Bible a
lot in different ways, sort

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:90%
of metaphysically at times.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And you think about this battle
with Satan, of this battle

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.700 align:middle line:90%
with this sort of dark side.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And what I think is
interesting, and some things

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I try to get through to people
is that even your best thoughts

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.350 align:middle line:90%
can be dangerous.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized that that
fear was that I felt alone.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly felt vulnerable,
that I was all by myself.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And what would usually
talk me off of that ledge

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.505 align:middle line:84%
was, OK, let's
take it back, Del.

00:07:15.505 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Right now you're thinking you're
responsible to save the world.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:10%
And you're-- you know,
this whole thing.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.930 align:middle line:10%
And I would go back and say,
all you are is a filmmaker, Del.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:90%
All you did was set up a camera.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:90%
You put people in front of it.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:90%
They spoke their truth.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And you edited those things
together, and you made a movie.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Now what everyone's
saying that movie

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.380 align:middle line:84%
is doing, what
they're saying you're

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%
responsible for, and
the pedestal they're

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.650 align:middle line:84%
putting-- all of that
is out of your control.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:90%
That is not who you are.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And I think that now--

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.270 align:middle line:84%
it's been probably a year
and a half since something

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:90%
has happened.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.807 align:middle line:90%

00:07:48.807 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:90%
I see the danger.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.555 align:middle line:84%
And it starts with,
I got to do more.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.665 align:middle line:84%
You got to see these kids,
these autistic children

00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:58.030 align:middle line:84%
with their parents, or
these injured children.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's an anger and
there's a frustration.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I just keep
thinking, I've got to do more,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I, I, I. Without me
it doesn't change.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And those thoughts
are debilitating.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.340 align:middle line:90%
And they're not accurate.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I think fear only has
come in at those moments where

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm doing something.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I get back to the
fact that I'm just a vessel,

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:84%
that I'm simply just allowing
what is desired by, I think,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.260 align:middle line:84%
this moment, this time, then--
and we're all just vessels.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:84%

to keep yourself in check

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.459 align:middle line:84%

you're not doing it.

the streetlights out?

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:10%
Something felt wrong.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought, that's
not my usual state of being.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Something's going on.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And I just turned around
and got off that street.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Another time on the
subway, someone got on,

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and the energy just
suddenly did not feel right.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I think you
can't feel that shift

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:90%
if you're in a place of fear.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:84%
You're constantly living in a
place of darkness and coldness.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll have no
awareness of danger

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
when it's actually
in your presence.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.520 align:middle line:84%
It's better to carry yourself
with a positive energy

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:90%
and know you're safe.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll know,
and you'll feel it.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Your intuition will let you
know something just shifted.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Listen to that.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not that
you're never afraid.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
But be aware of when
that has shifted.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:90%
And then act on that.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:10%

of fear being generated

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.900 align:middle line:10%

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.630 align:middle line:10%

this like the fever

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:10%
in a robust immune system.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.270 align:middle line:84%
It's necessary to have that
fever rise in order for healing

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:90%
to take place.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:10%
It's uncomfortable,
but it's building

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:10%
to an eruption that
happens before a resolution

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.400 align:middle line:10%
and healing--

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:10%

at the same goal.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.730 align:middle line:84%

pushback now because we

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.950 align:middle line:84%
are creating a defensive
nature on the other side, too.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that we need to believe
in the now, in the moment.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.702 align:middle line:90%
1,000 people in the room.

00:11:50.702 --> 00:11:53.090 align:middle line:84%

more people didn't show up.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:84%

one person right here

that knew somebody that

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:90%
went and changed everything.

go of their perspective,

from multiple perspectives.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:84%

is most common.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:84%

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:90%
in just one place.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And at the emotional
level is something

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think that
everybody takes care of,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and we do.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think we see the being,
the person as a whole,

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and not just as a physical body
that they need to be healed,

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:84%
in a natural way or
the less-harm way,

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:09.840 align:middle line:84%
but also as a mind, as
a heart, and as a soul.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:84%
We need to connect
to that spirituality.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And one of our
purposes-- or my purpose

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:90%
is to take care of that part.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And my purpose is to bring
people into this connection

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:90%
again, to the source.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>> You definitely do that.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Because your influence
is extremely positive

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:90%
here at the clinic.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, everybody feels
very comforted by that.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think
it's a lot of love.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:90%
We all love what we're doing.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.470 align:middle line:90%
We love being here.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.080 align:middle line:84%
We feel that we're
doing the right thing.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think once you know
you're doing the right thing,

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:84%
there is no way you can not
feel happy and protected.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you project
that with the patients.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:58.600 align:middle line:90%
They feel that way.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.858 align:middle line:84%
When you know you're doing the
right thing, you feel happy.

00:19:01.858 --> 00:19:03.767 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yes.

>> Just as fear can be
an impetus to awakening,

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:10%
my own fear led me to make
choices regarding changes

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:10%
in diet, meditation, different
practices and alternative

radiation, chemo, or surgery.

The expansion of my
own consciousness

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:84%
has motivated me to
seek greater coherence.
