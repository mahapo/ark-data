00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here today with
Liana from "The Earth Diet"

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and also, her new book,
"Cancer Free With Food."

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to be
talking about the top 15

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.350 align:middle line:84%
foods you can eat to help
prevent and reverse cancer.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.990 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be something
you do not want to miss.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:84%
It is a disease that touches
just about every family

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.580 align:middle line:90%
and person on this planet.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And to learn how to use
nutrition to nourish your body

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
important tips

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.520 align:middle line:84%
you can have to help prevent
cancer in your family.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I hope you enjoy this interview.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.675 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Liana, how you doing?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much for having me.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm excited to chat.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm excited, but I also want
to take a little bit of gravity

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle line:84%
to this conversation, because
cancer is something that

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.043 align:middle line:90%
affects everybody.

00:00:52.043 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody on
this planet that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.543 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have a relative
or a loved one or somebody

00:00:55.543 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:84%
they know who has been
touched by cancer.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I know that within the
"Food Matters" community,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:84%
this has been a big topic
for a number of years.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:84%
We've supported different events
and we have many documentaries

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:90%
on FMTV that cover this topic.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And increasingly, we
hear more and more

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:84%
about how powerful food can
be to help prevent and fight

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.193 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, what was
it that gave you

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:84%
the impetus or the inspiration
to wanted to write this book

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and start specializing, from
a nutritional perspective,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:90%
on this topic?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was first touched
by cancer from a young age.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So both of my grandparents
passed away from cancer.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And also, I grew up in Alice
Springs, in outback Australia.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So from age 5 is
when I can remember

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:84%
being taught about nutrition
and about food and healing.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the
Aboriginals believe

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:90%
that you can heal anything.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So if whatever sickness
or whatever is going on,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:84%
in the Aboriginal community,
you could get together

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and you could heal that with
prayer and also with food,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and so their whole concept
as food as medicine.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So from a young age,
that was instilled in me.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in the
Aboriginal community,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:90%
what is the cancer rate?

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:90%
0%.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.603 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these things
clicked from a very early age.

00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I watched
my grandfather,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:90%
who had an opposite diet.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:84%
He would eat McDonald's
and milkshakes and popcorn

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and lollies and
chocolate, and you know,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
he was obese and then eventually
passed away from cancer.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So then the next time I
was touched with cancer

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.800 align:middle line:84%
it was when I moved
to Brisbane City.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:84%
I went to university
and I started

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
to indulge in a fast food, junk
food, processed food lifestyle,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and I quickly became
very addicted to it.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So if I craved gummy bears for
breakfast, that's what I ate.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.035 align:middle line:90%
I would eat chocolate for lunch.

00:02:37.035 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
I would eat pizza,
McDonald's, KFC,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.660 align:middle line:84%
like every type of junk food
I was craving, I would eat.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And I did that every day for
five years until I myself

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:84%
ended up in hospital with a
golf ball sized lump in my neck.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the doctors did a
biopsy, and results came back,

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
which is on my website,
and I had a 3.7 centimeter

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.535 align:middle line:84%
tumor in my lymphatic system,
so very early stages of cancer.

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I was obviously
grateful it wasn't stage four.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:84%
They weren't like, you're
going to die next week.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But I was like, whoa, this
is a major wake up call.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Now I actually need to
go back to my roots,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:84%
apply everything I
learned as a child,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and actually get
healthy once and for all

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and stop eating all this
food that has no nutritional

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:90%
value at all.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I did, and
the first thing I did was I

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:90%
started juicing.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, what's
the fastest way

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:84%
to restore nutrition
back into my body

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and pump nutrition
back into my cells?

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I had knew
for so many years

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:84%
I'd deprived myself
of nutrition.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So I learned about
vegetable juicing,

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and I drank six
vegetable juices a day.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Game changer.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, game changer,
life changer, wow.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:90%
I felt better on the first day.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I also had to replace
all these cravings that I had.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So every time I had a
craving for something

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.850 align:middle line:84%
like chocolate or chicken
nuggets, pizza, burgers,

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, how
can I make this

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:90%
in a much healthier natural way.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.913 align:middle line:84%
Because this was 10 years ago
and this was in Australia,

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
so we didn't have
like a big Whole Foods

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
we could just go to and get
organic peanut butter cups

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:90%
or a like organic cookie dough.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So I got in the kitchen and
made everything from scratch,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and I started to heal
my body that way.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
And after three months
of this, the tumor

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
was completely dissolved,
completely gone.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:90%
And I felt so energized.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.695 align:middle line:90%
I felt so much better.

00:04:27.695 --> 00:04:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
I wanted to do

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.897 align:middle line:84%
is share all of these
recipes and these foods

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and these healing
tips with the world.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I've done
for the last decade.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It's in our darkness or it's
in this sort of language that

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the body speaks to us that
we get signs about what to do

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.120 align:middle line:90%
in our life I feel.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, it seems like your
calling has been to wake people

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.452 align:middle line:84%
up from all demographics
on how powerful food

00:04:50.452 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:90%
can be to transform the body.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's take this to a
granular sort of perspective,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:90%
this discussion.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.875 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
these types of foods

00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
that you've done quite
a bit of research

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:90%
on to put into the book.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
This 15 foods you've listed in
here that I want to talk about.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:90%
First off is broccoli sprouts.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think, you know,
early on in the day,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.310 align:middle line:84%
when I was doing some research
for creating the "Food Matters"

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:84%
documentary, I mean, sprouts
always stood out to me as like

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:90%
a hyper powerful food.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Why broccoli sprouts
in particular?

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to find out
like, what is the number one

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:90%
anticancer food on Earth?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I did so much
research into all the studies

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
that were out there and
the one that kept coming up

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.650 align:middle line:84%
was broccoli sprouts, and
it's because broccoli sprouts

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of sulforaphane.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's that compound
in broccoli sprouts,

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
that sulforaphane,
that kills cancer cells

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:90%
and reduces tumors.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And they've actually
done a lot of studies

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:84%
on mice and also
humans where they just

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:84%
get the sulforaphane extract
from the broccoli sprouts

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:90%
and inject it into tumors.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And I found that fascinating,
because every single tumor

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.220 align:middle line:90%
reduced.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
There was no tumor
that held its form when

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:90%
injected with sulforaphane.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:90%
So what does that tell us?

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that, you know, if
you're diagnosed with cancer,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
you definitely want to
start consuming broccoli

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.450 align:middle line:90%
sprouts every single day.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And how do you have them,
on a salad or straight up?

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're quite
peppery, right, from memory?

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.030 align:middle line:90%
They got a little bit of a bite.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.905 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit sour.

00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:90%
A little bit sour and peppery.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.542 align:middle line:84%
So my motto is like sprinkle
broccoli sprouts on everything.

00:06:21.542 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Except breakfast cereal,
which you probably shouldn't be

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.168 align:middle line:84%
eating breakfast cereal
when you're diagnosed

00:06:26.168 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
prevent cancer anyway.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Or a different type
of breakfast cereal,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:90%
like a chia seed cereal.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I have a recipe for
that in my book.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.978 align:middle line:84%
>> So I sprinkle it on if-- you
know, I'm a meat eater myself.

00:06:36.978 --> 00:06:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm mostly plant based, but
if someone is a meat eater,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:84%
definitely sprinkle broccoli
sprouts on everything.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're doing
chicken tenders or salmon,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.600 align:middle line:90%
you know, sprinkle it on there.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:84%
But also add it to
smoothies, that way

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.350 align:middle line:90%
you can disguise the taste.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:90%
And also, juicing as well.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:84%
But a really great way to
take broccoli sprouts is

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.460 align:middle line:84%
through supplements or
even a greens powder

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and just mix it in
water, and then you

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
don't even taste it, you just
get it down and feel amazing.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:90%
But fresh is best always.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Fresh is always best.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.012 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the
aboriginal standpoint

00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:09.720 align:middle line:84%
is if you can go out
to your own backyard

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and pick it straight from
the bush or the tree, that

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the most
nutrient dense, the most potent.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.862 align:middle line:84%
And it's also alive
with spirit too.

00:07:17.862 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So we definitely
want to get fresh.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Fresh is always best, exactly.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Next up was turmeric.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>> And why is it so powerful?

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I know it's been
quite hot lately.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's into the turmeric
lattes or the turmeric chai

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:90%
lattes.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're putting
turmeric in everything.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're staining
their favorite clothes,

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:84%
because they're using
it in the kitchen

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.222 align:middle line:84%
or juicing with it, which
makes you look like a smoker

00:07:41.222 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:90%
when you have orange fingers.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it really does.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So why is it so powerful,
and how do you use turmeric?

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's an anti-inflammatory,
so that's one of its best

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:90%
benefits.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's been studied so
much for all kinds of health

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:90%
issues, but especially cancer.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So they researched that a
lot of people with cancer

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:90%
are really inflamed.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:90%
So getting the body--

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:84%
like taking that inflammatory
stuff out of the body

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.180 align:middle line:84%
is obviously necessary
if someone has cancer,

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.040 align:middle line:84%
so eating turmeric
can help with that.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So I eat turmeric by
adding it to my recipes.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm making eggs, I'll
sprinkle some on there.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll also put it
in a salad dressing

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.455 align:middle line:84%
with some olive
oil and some lemon,

00:08:18.455 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and make like a
turmeric salad dressing.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I'll also juice it,
put it in smoothies.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:84%
But I also love to
take supplements,

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:90%
because it's not messy at all.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, you just get
it and get it down.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I also, to add to
your ways of using it,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.620 align:middle line:84%
chop it up into tiny cubes
with ginger and garlic,

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
and use that as a base
for making a curry paste.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh, love that.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, these Indian
curries are integrating a lot

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:84%
of these types of
spices as well.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Curry was the OG
for having turmeric,

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.710 align:middle line:90%
so we can't forget about that.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Most traditional.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:51.627 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:51.627 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
next one, which I think

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.822 align:middle line:90%
is broccoli, right?

00:08:54.822 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So the third
one is blueberries.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Blueberries!

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.230 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I've got the book
here too, so I can

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:90%
reference that for next time.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Blueberries, cool.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:90%
I had some this morning.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.480 align:middle line:90%
I love blueberries.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Organic's important
with berries.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Very important.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So why blueberries?

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're a super fruit,
and they have just so much

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:90%
antioxidants.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.353 align:middle line:84%
They're said to have
more antioxidants

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and vitamins than
any other fruit,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:90%
any other conventional fruit.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are
indigenous fruits out there

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that we do talk about and
I talk about in the book,

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:84%
like Kakadu plum
and stuff like that.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of like
a commercial fruit,

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:84%
blueberries have
the highest amount

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.370 align:middle line:84%
of antioxidants and
vitamins that they've found.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's also great
blood stabilizer.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And if someone's craving a lot
of sweets and a lot of candy,

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:84%
blueberries can help
fulfill that craving.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you
can't buy fresh,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:84%
because they're out of
season where you are, mostly,

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.753 align:middle line:84%
frozen blueberries are
almost everywhere now.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Everywhere in the
health food stores.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I also get fresh
ones, and if I'm not

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.675 align:middle line:84%
able to eat the whole
batch before they go bad,

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll put them in
the freezer too.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.925 align:middle line:84%
And that's always great
to throw in smoothies

00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:84%
or just eat as a snack
like a nice ice pop snack.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> My boy loves eating frozen
blueberries, and it ends up--

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.182 align:middle line:84%
anyway, I know what's
next, because I tripped up,

00:10:05.182 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:90%
it was broccoli, right?

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.120 align:middle line:90%
So number four is broccoli.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So also high in
sulforaphane, but not

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:90%
as much as broccoli sprouts.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:90%
And just so, so healthy for us.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, so many
health benefits

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:84%
from eating cruciferous
vegetables like cauliflower

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:90%
and kale and broccoli.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, one of my favorite
ways to eat broccoli

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:84%
is by making a broccoli
popcorn recipe.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's just massaging in
some nutritional yeast,

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.080 align:middle line:84%
some olive oil, and some
sea salt into broccoli,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and then roasting
it for 25 minutes.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.160 align:middle line:90%
And it comes out so buttery.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And like popcorn, it just
like pops in your mouth.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.680 align:middle line:90%
It's delicious.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>> That's nice.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I've been experimenting
with broccoli, because it's

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:90%
one of my favorite vegetables.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I like steaming it with
olive oil, lemon juice.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I also like frying
it a little bit

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.203 align:middle line:84%
in some oil or a butter or
something, just a little bit.

00:10:53.203 --> 00:10:54.620 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
different ways you

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:90%
can make broccoli taste good.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, totally.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Number five, flaxseed.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Flaxseed.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Old school.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:02.282 --> 00:11:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I feel like flaxseed
turned around.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.115 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
original superfood.

00:11:05.115 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:90%
The OG.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
studies on flaxseed

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:84%
in regards to cancer,
especially with breast cancer.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So they did one study where they
put just a teaspoon of flaxseed

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.180 align:middle line:84%
into a muffin and they
had women eat this muffin

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
every single day, and they
noticed a reduction in all

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.240 align:middle line:84%
of their cancers just over
a matter of a few weeks.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't realize
flaxseeds were so powerful

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:90%
until I was doing my research.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah,
flaxseeds are awesome.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'll add flaxseed
powder to muffins.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.095 align:middle line:84%
I make some great
anticancer muffins.

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:84%
A recipe for that
is in the book.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And then also add
it to smoothies.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Or if I'm making some
grass fed beef balls,

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.230 align:middle line:90%
I'll add it in there as well.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.850 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's
this sort of stacking

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.780 align:middle line:84%
the deck in your favor thing
happening in this conversation,

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's like if you can add
as many of these as possible

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
into your diet, you're
sort of like stacking up

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:90%
the anticancer effects.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're reducing your
risk of ever getting cancer.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:90%
So that's the goal.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.327 align:middle line:84%
If someone who's watching
doesn't have cancer,

00:12:02.327 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
then you want to keep
your body cancer free.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So these are tools and
foods to help, you know,

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.047 align:middle line:84%
make sure your risk of
getting cancer is always low.

00:12:10.047 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But if someone does
have cancer, these

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:84%
are all proven to help
kill those cancer cells.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Number six, classic, dark,
leafy, green vegetables.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.995 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, this is
like grandma, right?

00:12:20.995 --> 00:12:22.803 align:middle line:84%
I feel like, you
know, eat your greens.

00:12:22.803 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:90%
So which ones in particular?

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Any that we should
like focus on?

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So definitely collard
greens, kale, spinach.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And anything that grows
local in your area

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.970 align:middle line:90%
that's dark and leafy green.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is because it's
high in chlorophyll.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's the chlorophyll,
when we consume

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that, it goes into
our blood system

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and it creates a lot of
oxygen, it alkalizes the body.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.510 align:middle line:84%
It makes the body feel very
positive and very alive.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.135 align:middle line:84%
And so after I
healed I said, you

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:84%
know what, I'm
going to drink one

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:84%
green juice every single
day for the rest of my life.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:90%
I thought, why not?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Why not consume
chlorophyll every day?

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.418 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not something
they teach us in school.

00:12:58.418 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Like you need certain vitamins
and minerals and nutrients

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.520 align:middle line:84%
every day as a human being,
I was never taught that.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But since my healing,
I was like, yeah,

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:84%
that chlorophyll is going
in every single day.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So every day, I make sure to
get some green leafy vegetables

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
or a green juice or a smoothie,
or just a greens powder mixed

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.370 align:middle line:90%
in water.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely
believe it helps

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle line:90%
keep everything cancer free.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And you've also got here
watercress on that list.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.778 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, I love some watercress.

00:13:25.778 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's a good one.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one in salads too.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Romaine, not as dark you say,
but romaine's also delicious.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Parsley.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Parsley is a good
one, and cilantro.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Cilantro, or coriander,
as we know it in our country

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:90%
of origin, right?

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Coriander.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Number seven, garlic.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Garlic.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So garlic has a lot
of compounds that

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.570 align:middle line:84%
have been proven to help
heal cancer, especially

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:90%
bowel cancer.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.338 align:middle line:84%
So if someone doesn't like
the smell or the taste,

00:13:54.338 --> 00:13:55.880 align:middle line:84%
they can just take
garlic supplements

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.190 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, just swallow
like one little clove

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and it will just go
straight into the gut.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:01.773 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:14:01.773 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a gut bomb.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Swallow a clove a garlic.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:84%
First-- it's a first ever--
first ever, everybody

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.210 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:90%
I've never done that before.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh really?

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that a thing?

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>> It is, yeah.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:90%
You have to try that.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's like
its own supplement.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.843 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like it's
like you're taking--

00:14:13.843 --> 00:14:15.020 align:middle line:90%
like popping a big pill.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.148 align:middle line:84%
>> And it goes into your
gut and just explodes.

00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like a garlic bomb.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, cool.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:90%
I might try that.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:90%
I love garlic.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I've juice garlic
before, done some things.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:84%
People don't
necessarily like that.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:90%
I can handle it.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:29.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:29.623 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, it doesn't have as
much of a smell if you just

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:84%
swallow it whole, because it's
more straight into your body

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:90%
than if you're juicing it.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
But when my mom found out
she had breast cancer,

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.560 align:middle line:84%
she started juicing
right away and she

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.690 align:middle line:84%
put garlic into her
juice every single day.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.330 align:middle line:84%
She felt like that was really
helping to detox her body.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, my mom's been
cancer free now for six years.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:90%
So yay!

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.905 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:14:51.905 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel-- quick segue.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:84%
It's funny that, I mean,
you've helped your mom heal.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.130 align:middle line:90%
I've helped my father heal.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
In a way, you know,
this sort of information

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:84%
died off in the last generation
or two, and you know,

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to bring it
back a little bit more.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, totally.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I read the new stats
on cancer is one in two men

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:84%
are getting diagnosed
and one in three women

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.200 align:middle line:84%
in their lifetime, in the
Western world, in America.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's just way too high.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:90%
You know, cancer is an epidemic.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.723 align:middle line:84%
Like it's just--
it's not something

00:15:20.723 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:90%
that we need to suffer from.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:90%
It's awful.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you've
had cancer yourself

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and gone through that mentally,
spiritually, emotionally, it

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.520 align:middle line:84%
feels like hell
every single day.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
we can prevent with food

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.257 align:middle line:90%
and feel better with food.

00:15:36.257 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's an
important message we need

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:90%
to get out there to everyone.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I hear you.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Number eight here is mushrooms.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Mushrooms.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been hearing a
little bit about this lately.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I was recently chatting
with Ocean Robbins.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's a breast
cancer research lady here

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I think in California
who talks about the power

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.263 align:middle line:84%
that mushrooms and green
tea can have in combination.

00:15:56.263 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't even like
special medicinal mushrooms,

00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
it was like every
type of mushroom.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.342 align:middle line:84%
>> So what mushrooms are you
talking about, everything?

00:16:02.342 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Every mushroom, yeah.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ones that
are edible, obviously.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:06.650 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many
studies on mushrooms.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:90%
And they grow in the sun.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:84%
They're so connected to nature,
so many healing benefits.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:90%
So any kinds of mushrooms.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:84%
But someone should experiment
which mushrooms like really

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:90%
work for them.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And also, mushrooms
aren't good for every body

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.850 align:middle line:90%
type I've discovered also.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:84%
They are a top anti-cancer
food, but some bodies just

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:90%
don't work that well with them.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
experiment and see.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:31.910 align:middle line:90%
Also, I think--

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if
this is the case,

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.700 align:middle line:84%
but you know in the
doctrine of signatures,

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.492 align:middle line:84%
you know how the tomato
looks like a heart?

00:16:36.492 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:84%
The mushroom looks like
the breast tissue in a way.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Like the curve and the
little lines and things.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's so good for women,
for sure, with breast cancer.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I found that
study as well.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I love to drink mushroom
hot chocolate, actually.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's a reishi infused
cacao with some coconut sugar,

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:84%
or you know, no sugar for
people who want to cut that out.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:01.813 align:middle line:90%
And it's delicious.

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
taste the mushroom,

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:84%
but you're getting
those benefits.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:90%
Number nine, cacao.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:08.095 align:middle line:90%
Cacao!

00:17:08.095 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Chocolate's on the list?

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Chocolate is medicine.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.263 align:middle line:90%
>> What type of chocolate?

00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so it has to
be real pure cacao.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:84%
So this is cacao which is
just straight up cacao beans

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:90%
without anything added to it.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, no emulsifiers,
no sugar, no dairy.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so less
excitement everybody.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:90%
Less excitement.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Pull it back.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's just the
bitter, raw cacao.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Which you know, bitter medicine,
there's some truth in that,

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.470 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.290 align:middle line:84%
The bitter flavors, you
know, give us this indication

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.690 align:middle line:84%
that there are some powerful
compounds in the food.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, some health happening.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>> So raw cacao?

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.715 align:middle line:84%
>> But let's bring
the excitement back,

00:17:42.715 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:84%
because there's lots
we can do with cacao,

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and I actually have a lot of
chocolate recipes in this book.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And chocolate is- I say
juicing and chocolate were

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.860 align:middle line:84%
my two main things
that helped me heal.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I've-- I had so much
chocolate when I was healing,

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's because that really
helped me with the magnesium.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Helped to relax my
body, but also kept me

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:90%
excited at the same time.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So I made chocolate
peanut butter cups,

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:84%
but now, in the book, I say
make chocolate Sun Butter cups

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:07.980 align:middle line:90%
instead.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, chocolate Sun Butter
pie, chocolate smoothies,

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.853 align:middle line:84%
chocolate ice cream made
with cashews or almonds.

00:18:12.853 --> 00:18:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's so
many different ways

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:90%
that we can use cacao powder.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And I found that cacao actually
has anti-tumor activities,

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.472 align:middle line:90%
which was fascinating.

00:18:21.472 --> 00:18:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I've loved
chocolate for so long,

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:84%
but to find out that it's
an actual functional food

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.553 align:middle line:84%
and it's medicinal
is like, yes, now I

00:18:27.553 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
can have it-- keep having it
every single day for the rest

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.010 align:middle line:90%
of my life as well.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's one of the most
complex foods on the planet.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, if
you're lucky enough

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.450 align:middle line:84%
to live where it grows too
you can eat the cacao fruit

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and direct from nature,
so that's exciting.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.018 align:middle line:84%
Number 10-- this one's
a bit of an outcast.

00:18:48.018 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Bit of a newcomer to the scene.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Tiger nuts.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Tiger nuts!

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Whoo!

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Not really from a tiger
though, they're just--

00:18:53.922 --> 00:18:54.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:54.722 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>> No, they're not.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:56.300 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why our paleo
ancestors gave them that name.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I think because
they were like, oh,

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:84%
let's make them
have conversations

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.410 align:middle line:90%
about it in 200 years.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:90%
It'll be really funny.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But they're actually
not a nut at all,

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:90%
nothing to do with tiger nuts.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:90%
They're a root vegetable.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:90%
They're a tuber.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:84%
They have a long scientific
name on Wikipedia,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:90%
but their nickname's tiger nuts.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, apparently because
our paleo ancestors thought

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:84%
they looked maybe
like tiger nuts.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:84%
But there are some great
studies on tiger nuts

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that show they really
help protect the liver

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and they help to detox
the liver as well.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
So tiger nuts are really
high potassium and also iron.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So they're said to have the
same amount of iron as red meat.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're an excellent iron
source, especially for vegans,

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:90%
vegetarians.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And so if someone is
going through chemo,

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that's a great one to drink
every day is the tiger nut

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.680 align:middle line:90%
milk.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:90%
And they're quite easy to drink.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.760 align:middle line:84%
You just-- there's a recipe
for it in my book of course.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.170 align:middle line:84%
But you just mix a cup of tiger
nuts with four cups of water

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and that's it, that's
all you have to blend,

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and it comes out to be this
white, creamy, sweet milk.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.985 align:middle line:84%
It's naturally sweet,
like a sweet potato,

00:20:02.985 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have to
add anything to it

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.770 align:middle line:84%
like you would almond
milk or coconut milk.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.320 align:middle line:84%
It's so sweet and
delicious and refreshing.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And people can find that
in most supermarkets?

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.235 align:middle line:84%
Or I guess online if
they have trouble.

00:20:14.235 --> 00:20:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Health food
stores, online, yeah.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And they are said to be the
next newest, big superfood,

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
so we should start to
see them a lot more.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Number 11 now is ginger.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Ginger, yes.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Awesome anti-inflammatory.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So ginger I love to
add to juice or a tea,

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's something I
have every other day.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:84%
When I was healing, I had
ginger all day every day,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:90%
because my body was so inflamed.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And especially
because my problems

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.580 align:middle line:84%
was in my lymphatic system,
so that's the body's sewage

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.390 align:middle line:90%
system, right?

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So drinking ginger
helped to drain out

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:84%
all the toxins from my lymphatic
system and get it going again.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I love it with beet
and carrot and lemon.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.420 align:middle line:90%
That's delicious.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.165 align:middle line:84%
Next up, we have
number 12, grapes.

00:20:59.165 --> 00:20:59.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Grapes.

00:20:59.965 --> 00:21:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> A bit surprised to see this
on the list, to be honest.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the humble grape,
it's made the list.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it the sort of protective
components of the skin

00:21:09.055 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
in there, the antioxidant
component, or what is it?

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>> It is, yeah.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's said to help
with skin cancer a lot,

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:84%
which skin cancer is the
number one most common cancer

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:84%
that people are dying
from, which I was also

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.828 align:middle line:90%
surprised to find out about.

00:21:21.828 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't planning to put
grapes on the list at all,

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:84%
but after I did the
research, I was like, wow,

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.710 align:middle line:90%
those are really--

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:84%
you know, they've been
studied to protect

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:90%
the skin, especially.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:90%
And they're naturally sweet too.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, if we
look at our design,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:84%
like our human design and the
foods we were designed to eat,

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.790 align:middle line:84%
like grapes were
meant to be our candy.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:84%
We weren't ever meant to
make all this crazy candy

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:90%
and consume that candy.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So that was also
meant to be that like,

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:84%
wow, I'm just going to pop
a grape, and I'm so happy.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think we get a feeling
after we've been through

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.260 align:middle line:90%
a cleanse.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Then when you approach
a grape or a peach,

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:84%
it's the most incredible thing
you've ever had in your life,

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.300 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:84%
So bringing that
back is exciting.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:00.590 align:middle line:90%
I love your enthusiasm.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.747 align:middle line:84%
>> And if someone is excited
about fruits as candy,

00:22:02.747 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:84%
then that's a good
indicator that, you know,

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:84%
you need to do a cleanse so
that you can get excited about

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:90%
fruits again.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Number 13, tomatoes.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Tomatoes.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We said we weren't
going to say tomatoes.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.738 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, we're both Australians,
we're going to say tomatoes.

00:22:17.738 --> 00:22:18.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Tomatoes!

00:22:18.538 --> 00:22:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Tomatoes.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Also a bit controversial.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But from all the
studies I've done,

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%
you know, they're
high in vitamin C

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and they do have a lot
of components in it

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that really help
with breast cancer

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:31.790 align:middle line:90%
and also skin cancer as well.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.933 align:middle line:84%
So you know, not for
everyone as well,

00:22:33.933 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:84%
because it is a night shade
and it can create inflammation

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.150 align:middle line:90%
in some people.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:41.600 align:middle line:84%
But some people can really enjoy
it through juicing or making

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:90%
a nice tomato sauce.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Number 14, lemon.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Good old lemons.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>> The best.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.650 align:middle line:84%
I think there is a lot to
be said about lemon juice

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and water as the most important
life changing health habit you

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:90%
could develop ever.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Something to do every morning.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Why is it?

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it because it's
really alkaline?

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Is it because there's
cancer protective components

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:90%
in the lemon?

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very alkalizing.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
It's also high in
vitamin C and it's just

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.360 align:middle line:90%
so simple for everyone to make.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
if someone has cancer

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.728 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have a
lot of time or money,

00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
it's something that's very
affordable as well that they

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:84%
can say, you know what,
I can make a lemon water

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:90%
this morning.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Just 30 seconds, squeeze a
lemon into two cups of water,

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:90%
drink it down.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:84%
It helps flush out
toxins from the body,

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.450 align:middle line:84%
helps flush out the
liver, alkalizes the body.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And no one ever drank lemon
water every single day

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:84%
for seven days and said
like, I feel awful this week

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:84%
from drinking lemon
water every day.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Great observation.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.120 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's number 14.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like we need
a drum roll right now,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.370 align:middle line:90%
since it's the last one.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:44.630 align:middle line:90%

It's quinoa, number 15.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Which is cool.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's like a pseudo
grain type thing in there.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Is quinoa a grain or a seed?

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a grain.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a grain.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.007 align:middle line:90%
So there's a grain in there.

00:23:58.007 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Very wholesome grain.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.855 align:middle line:84%
So-- and you know, this is
also can be controversial,

00:24:01.855 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:84%
so it's worth having the
conversation about quinoa,

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.290 align:middle line:84%
like why is it an
anti-cancer food.

to things like gluten, breads,
all those kinds of grains

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:84%
that we know are really heavy
and spike our blood sugar,

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and also create a lot
of acidity in the body.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.855 align:middle line:84%
