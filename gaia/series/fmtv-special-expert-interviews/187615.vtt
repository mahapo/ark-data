00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.012 align:middle line:84%
It's James here,
from "Food Matters."

00:00:20.012 --> 00:00:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to this
FMTV special with Rupy

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.570 align:middle line:90%
from "The Doctor's Kitchen."

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.695 align:middle line:84%
And you can check him out
at TheDoctorsKitchen.com,

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:84%
also follow some of these
awesome recipes on Instagram.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And Rupy is a medical doctor.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:90%
He practices general medicine.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:84%
He's also practiced
emergency medicine as well,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and he's trying to
bring inspirational food

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and nutritional advice to the
mainstream medical system,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.920 align:middle line:84%
in particular the
NHS here in the UK.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.842 align:middle line:84%
I admire him for his
passion and determination

00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:84%
in sticking with
it, and I'm really

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:84%
inspired to speak with him
today to learn about some

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:84%
of his practices for helping
inspire people to eat better

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and also some tips
for staying healthy.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:90%
So check it out.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a general practitioner,
an emergency doctor,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and I set up something called
"The Doctor's Kitchen,"

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
which is basically a YouTube
channel and social media

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:84%
platforms where I teach
people the use of nutrition

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:84%
in medicine and how I'm trying
to inspire people that food is

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually something I
started because of my patients,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.955 align:middle line:84%
but my colleagues-- my
medical colleagues are all

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
interested in this
sort of thing.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.622 align:middle line:84%
We're now getting tons of
emails from medical students,

00:01:26.622 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
like, where'd you get
this knowledge from?

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I just started
it on the back of that.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:38.482 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
There's been a couple of
catalysts throughout my life

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.070 align:middle line:84%
that have sort of led
me to this sort of path.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:84%
The first one, I think, was
when my mom got ill herself.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So she had anaphylaxis,
and from an unknown cause.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.730 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't really
a reason as to why

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:84%
she kept on getting these
anaphylactic episodes.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know
what anaphylaxis is,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:84%
it's basically where your
blood pressure goes down.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
You have a severe
allergic reaction.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
We usually have to treat
it with adrenaline.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:84%
She had every single
test you can think of.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Every single doctor, professor,
immunology, everything, and we

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
couldn't really find
out what the reason was.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So back then-- this is going
back, like, 15 years ago.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:84%
She essentially put herself
on an elimination diet.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:84%
This is when I was in
early teens, like, 13, 14.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:90%
And she would only have greens.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
She would only
have whole grains.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't have dairy.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:84%
She wouldn't have meat,
nothing for about a year,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:90%
and anaphylaxis just went.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was always in
the back of my mind.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:84%
We never really talked about it
when I was growing up too much,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%
not really the research she
put into it, or the emphasis

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But that was always in
the back of my head.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.603 align:middle line:84%
When I went to med
school, I was like,

00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:48.593 align:middle line:84%
you can use food
in a medicinal way.

00:02:48.593 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't really understand it,
and I didn't get the answers

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:90%
to that throughout med school.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
But that was always at
the back of my head.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I actually
got ill myself as well.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So I suffer something called
atrial fibrillation, so

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:90%
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:84%
My heart rate goes to
180 beats per minute.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Feel dizzy, get a little
bit of shortness of breath.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Used to have it weekly.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:90%
There were some triggers.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it could be a glass
wine, sometimes a heavy meal,

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
sometimes a night shift in A&E.
I would just flip into this,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and it would last, like, four
or five hours, or even 12 hours.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And again, every single
test under the sun.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.492 align:middle line:84%
I had the
electrophysiology studies,

00:03:22.492 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
the wire that goes
into your groin,

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:84%
looks at your heart to see
if there's any aberrant

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:84%
connections, aberrant
electrical impulses.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't find anything.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.295 align:middle line:84%
So what the
discussion led to was

00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:84%
I should have an ablation,
which is basically

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.780 align:middle line:84%
where you put a
wire into the heart

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and you burn around an
area of the pulmonary vein

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.957 align:middle line:90%
where usually these cells fire.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about it,
and I had discussion

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:90%
with a bunch of cardiologists.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And my mom, obviously, being the
naturopathic sort of influence

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
she is, she said, look, just
try things with your diet

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:90%
and just see what happens.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So I basically tried a
whole bunch of things--

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:84%
detoxed completely, no caffeine,
no alcohol, clean diet,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:90%
exercise.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Nothing worked, to be honest.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But after about six months
of drinking spirulina

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and chlorella, and
really focusing

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.430 align:middle line:84%
on a plant-based
whole diet, it sort of

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.501 align:middle line:84%
went away for about
two or three years.

00:04:18.501 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:84%
And I can count
the number of times

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.470 align:middle line:90%
I had AF on one hand in a year.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
going from once a week, there's
certainly been a correlation.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And I can't really explain
that, and no medical person

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
can explain it, no
cardiologist or anything.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite it's
quite interesting how

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
we have these sort
of experiences

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:90%
and it changes the trajectory.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So those were the two main
catalysts, but then also

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:90%
patients.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So my patients who come
in to me in my GP office

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, I've got IBS,
I've got autoimmune disease.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.397 align:middle line:84%
Is anything in my diet
that can change that?

00:04:49.397 --> 00:04:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And the general
answer for a clinician

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.773 align:middle line:84%
is, there isn't evidence
to suggest anything.

00:04:53.773 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:90%
So I have to do my research.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I have to teach
myself nutrition.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I had to read all the
clinical journals.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.862 align:middle line:84%
I had to go to all the
global conferences looking

00:04:59.862 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:84%
at the science behind
nutrition to make sure I'm not

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.652 align:middle line:90%
doing any harm as a clinician.

00:05:03.652 --> 00:05:05.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've taken
an oath, do no harm.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.885 align:middle line:84%
So anything that
I say is has got

00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:09.650 align:middle line:84%
to have an evidence
base behind it.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.803 align:middle line:84%
And I used to just get
really late in my clinics,

00:05:12.803 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
talking to people
about recipes, talking

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
to people about what
things they should

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:90%
be putting into their diet.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.522 align:middle line:84%
I'd always be the guy
people would go to

00:05:19.522 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:84%
for nutrition
advice, so I thought,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:90%
there's got to be an easier way.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I started
"The Doctor's Kitchen," which

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
is YouTube tutorials and
recipes and making it engaging.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an authoritative person.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't want it to be
like a prescriptive thing.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.458 align:middle line:84%
I want you to be empowered
and inspired to look

00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:90%
for these foods yourself.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.032 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to
your supermarket,

00:05:40.032 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at the greens,
you're looking at the colors.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:84%
You're realizing that
this is information.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:90%
This can impact your genes.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:90%
This can impact your DNA makeup.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:84%
This can impact on your blood
sugar regulation and everything

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.200 align:middle line:84%
else, and to appreciate the
concept of bioindividuality

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a bit
of a journey so far.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.195 align:middle line:84%
I'm very junior in
it, but it's exciting.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:02.995 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:05.845 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:05.845 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I haven't figured out why
nutrition doesn't play a bigger

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:90%
role in medical education.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I went to one-- and
I'm not bragging here,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:84%
but I went to one of the best
medical schools in the world.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:84%
It's renowned for its
research capability,

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and we only got, like, less
than 11 or 12 hours in nutrition

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:84%
in the whole of the six-year
course that I went to.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind
of a shock for me

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
when I did my own research
after qualifying as a doctor,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.835 align:middle line:84%
after going to quite well
established medical university,

00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
that there was all this
information out there

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't being given to us.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And we were being taught the
same dogma, the same things

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:84%
about saturated
fats, the same thing

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.230 align:middle line:84%
about having a largely
carbohydrate, starch-based diet

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.538 align:middle line:90%
for everyone.

00:06:51.538 --> 00:06:52.830 align:middle line:90%
It was a bit of a wake up call.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I can't really
answer the question

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.670 align:middle line:84%
as to why we're not
using this information.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But what I can say
is that using myself

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:84%
as a platform and
collective people

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.120 align:middle line:84%
in the sort of wellness
sphere will bring it

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
more to the forefront,
and that's actually

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that I want to
bring into medical education--

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
culinary medicine, teaching
medical students how to cook,

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
teaching them the
beauty of food,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and inspiring them that
disease prevention and disease

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
treatment can be
hand-in-hand with nutrition.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.090 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.460 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.190 align:middle line:84%
I was quite worried about
the backlash, if you like,

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.920 align:middle line:84%
or the response from
my medical colleagues,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:90%
not so much my patients.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I think my patients would
have like really appreciated

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:84%
their doctor being
enthusiastic about food, trying

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.110 align:middle line:84%
to help them, because that's
essentially what we all do,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:90%
that we're all trying to do.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:84%
But the response my colleagues
has been really good so far.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:84%
You've got a few people
are saying, how can you

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:84%
treat hay fever with matcha
teas or increasing your greens

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.020 align:middle line:84%
If you use the evidence,
if I'm saying everything

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.065 align:middle line:84%
with an educated, unbiased
opinion, then people,

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:90%
they pick up on that.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.780 align:middle line:90%
They understand it.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:84%
They understand where the
passion is coming from.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And there is a real
hunger these days.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.900 align:middle line:84%
There is a real interest from
the medical community in food

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.188 align:middle line:84%
and medicine, and
I'm latching onto it

00:08:15.188 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just putting
information out there.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's been really encouraging.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.573 align:middle line:90%
It's been a really good journey.

00:08:19.573 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And I've met so many people
as well in this world

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.215 align:middle line:84%
like, obviously, yourself,
"Food Matters" and everything.

00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:84%
But across the world,
just being able to talk

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:84%
to people on the same
wavelength, share ideas.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:84%
The response for
a doctor cooking

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:84%
has been really interesting,
actually, really good

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.580 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much to
be said for talking about it,

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
talking about putting
greens in your diet.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you show people that
you are doing yourself,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
you're more motivated
to tell them about it,

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.700 align:middle line:84%
but they're more motivated to
say, my doctor's doing this.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:90%
My doctor is cooking.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:90%
He's in the kitchen.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.270 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be important.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that's sort of the
line I'm trying to take.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.280 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I think there's two ways.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:84%
One, the quality of the research
is always under scrutiny

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
nutritional medicine.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.810 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to use
certain qualities of research

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:84%
to base cost-benefit analysis
on real generalizing changes

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.720 align:middle line:84%
to a big, bureaucratic,
monolithic organization

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:90%
like the NHS, for example.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have some
real solid evidence.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit of a
contentious issue

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:84%
because even the
evidence that we've

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
based a lot of our
nutritional guidelines on,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't bet your house on.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's looking at the
quality of nutritional research

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:84%
that's coming up from
nutrition journals,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:90%
it isn't always there.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:84%
You've got RCTs, Randomized
Controlled Trials,

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.190 align:middle line:84%
which are, like, the base
of what everything looks at,

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and meta analysis
and everything else.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:84%
What we look at a lot of
like food questionnaires,

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
inherent bias with that.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So people are incline
knob to believe that.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:84%
The other thing-- and I think
this is the bigger factor--

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:84%
is that once you've been
taught a certain way

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
from the medical establishment,
from peers that you hold

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.670 align:middle line:84%
in the highest regard, you're
going to defend your thinking

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and the medical establishment
as much as possible.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
victim to this well.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
When I found out about ketotic
diet for the first time

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:84%
or low carbohydrate, high
fat, my initial gut reaction

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:90%
is, that's wrong.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:24.730 align:middle line:90%
That's a fad.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:25.980 align:middle line:90%
This is what I've been taught.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.850 align:middle line:84%
This is what my esteemed
professor taught me

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:90%
in medical university.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And you just defend
it automatically.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
You automatically
antagonize anyone

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that questions your
own understanding.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And as a medical professional,
that's even heightened, I find.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.070 align:middle line:84%
But really, when you go
down to the nuts and bolts

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the
evidence, and you

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.880 align:middle line:84%
listen to people-- as
a general practitioner,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:90%
you're client facing.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:84%
You're not just one of a huge
study of thousands of people.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:90%
These are individuals.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.830 align:middle line:84%
You realize the impact
of bioindividuality.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
You realize the impact of
one nutritional guideline

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:00.962 align:middle line:90%
doesn't apply to everyone.

00:11:00.962 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
There's some people that
have a high propensity

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:90%
to insulin resistance.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:84%
There's some people
that survived

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:84%
culturally, ethnically, their
background, on a high-fat diet.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
need to listen to.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really
difficult one, but I

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:84%
think going to the
future, we'll be able to--

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.470 align:middle line:84%
we'll learn to recognize
our patients as individuals.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
will pave the way

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:84%
for more nutritional guidance
and better nutrition guidance.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.626 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.627 align:middle line:84%
I think there's certainly--
despite the bioindividuality

00:11:35.627 --> 00:11:37.710 align:middle line:84%
argument, there are certain
nutritional principles

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:84%
that people can always look at,
and that is, in this climate,

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.670 align:middle line:84%
reducing your refined
carbohydrates and sugars.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
We have a huge, huge
dependency-- in this country,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.850 align:middle line:84%
globally, in lots of different
health care systems--

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
we have a huge dependency
on carbohydrates,

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:90%
and that needs to change.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
look at our bowls.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
We need to look out
plates and see colors.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.425 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why I say colors--

00:11:59.425 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and it sounds a bit hippie, and
it sounds real alternative--

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
is because that's where
the phytocompounds are.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:84%
This is where your
minerals and nutrients are.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
the biochemical pathways

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:84%
of, for example, your
liver, you realize

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.730 align:middle line:84%
the catalyzers, the
enzymatic process,

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:84%
are dependent on things
like minerals and vitamins

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and amino acids of
certain branches.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we need to
be educating our patients on.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend
colorful bowls where

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:84%
you've got the full complement
of all the different nutrients

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
that plant-based
diets can offer you.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm not fully plant-based.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate the
fact that everyone's

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:84%
got their own individual taste
when it comes to veganism

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:90%
or if there's animal.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I have meat about two,
three times a week,

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:90%
but that works for me.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I used to eat two or
three times a day meat.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that was having
a definite impact on me.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And to afford the
quality of meat I want,

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:84%
it would be exceedingly
expensive as well.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
So a colorful bowl is
definitely what I recommend.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Eating within
certain time periods,

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.447 align:middle line:84%
to stop the late night
snacking, to stop the eating

00:13:03.447 --> 00:13:06.030 align:middle line:84%
throughout the whole day because
that leads to insulin spikes.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to
resistance, and that

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
can lead to fat deposition,
all the rest of it.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So as a general rule
of thumb, I always

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.530 align:middle line:84%
recommend a 12-hour
eating window,

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:84%
whether that be 7:00 AM to
7:00 PM or 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Outside those windows,
you don't eat.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:90%
So there's that second thing.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:84%
The third thing is it's
not related to food.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:90%
It's actually sleep.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So your circadian rhythms
are really, really important

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to eating
because that determines--

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
when you eat, it determines
your circadian rhythm.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
That has an effect on
melatonin, all these

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:84%
are the hormones that have
massive impact on your weight,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and then, ultimately,
your health as well.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Hydration-- so hydration
is really important.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:84%
We're probably under
hydrating ourselves,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and there is a
focus on making sure

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.650 align:middle line:90%
that we're having enough water.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
There is a balance,
under hydration

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:90%
versus over hydration.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.752 align:middle line:84%
I drink about 1
1/2 to two liters,

00:13:54.752 --> 00:13:56.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's dependent on
the person as well,

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and depending on
medical conditions.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want
to be recommending

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:84%
someone who's got heart failure
with two liters of water

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:90%
per day.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:90%
It's really individual.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Those are the basic
steps I would say,

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and then making
sure that you do--

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:84%
actually, make sure you do have
a good quality source fats.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Fats are something that has
been demonized for years.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Even when I was at
medical college,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:90%
saturated fats are bad for you.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Polyunsaturated, plant-based
oils are good for you.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that the
complete reverse,

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and actually, we should
be encouraging people

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
to look at the
quality of their fats

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:84%
rather than the quantities
of monounsaturated

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
versus saturated fats
and all the rest of it.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So nuts, seeds, beans, oils,
extra-virgin olive oil,

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:84%
coconut oils, these
are all great things

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:90%
to put in your diet.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And again, it comes through
bioindividuality with how much

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:90%
should you put into it.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So those are the basic
principles-- colorful bowls,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:84%
hydration, good quality fats,
and good quality proteins

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.498 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:57.498 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
I would cook a meal for whoever
the current prime minister is

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.020 align:middle line:90%
right now in the NHS because--

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:90%
in the NHS, in England--

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.210 align:middle line:84%
because if I can convince them
and empower them and inspire

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.720 align:middle line:84%
them that good food can be
beneficial for your health

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and taste amazing,
maybe that will

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on
government policy,

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that
would change the era

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that we're in right
now when it comes

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.115 align:middle line:84%
to getting better nutrition and
better nutrition education in

00:15:29.115 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and around the
NHS, which is sort

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:90%
of what I'm about right now.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I would definitely cook probably
something like a nourish bowl.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.788 align:middle line:84%
So it would be a really
good complement of greens

00:15:38.788 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:84%
on one side, probably
bok choy, which

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:84%
has got really good evidence
towards its anticancer ability,

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
lots of different
peppers and colorful veg,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.377 align:middle line:84%
so probably some
tomatoes that have

00:15:49.377 --> 00:15:51.460 align:middle line:84%
been braised with a little
bit of sundried tomato,

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:90%
and herbs as well.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.442 align:middle line:84%
So I'd probably use
rosemary because it's

00:15:54.442 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:84%
got rosmarinic
acid, and that's got

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.275 align:middle line:84%
really good evidence
towards it's

00:15:57.275 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:90%
an anti-inflammatory effects.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And with a side of
whole grain, so I'd

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.546 align:middle line:84%
probably use either amaranth or
quinoa in a whole grain form,

00:16:05.546 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:84%
but making sure that the
proportions of the bowl kind of

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:84%
reflect how I think
we should be eating.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So the carbohydrate
portion probably

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't reflect more than
15% or 20% of the bowl,

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:90%
and the rest would be colors.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And then probably--
she's a meat eater--

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:84%
some good quality, locally
sourced fish, so maybe

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:84%
something from Scotland
or maybe from Cornwall.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:90%
We've got some really good crab.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So again, I'm setting
all the flavors

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.383 align:middle line:84%
to kind of reflect what we're
good for in Britain here today.

00:16:32.383 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So everything would be
local because I believe

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:84%
in SLOP-y foods, so sloppy
standing for Seasonal Local

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Organic and Phytochemical-rich.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Those are SLOP-y foods.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a real good
scientific evidence

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.705 align:middle line:84%
as to why we should
be eating seasonal,

00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:90%
why we should be local.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's really about
connecting the medical world

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.312 align:middle line:90%
to the wellness world.

00:16:51.312 --> 00:16:53.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a nice little vacuum
in the middle where, actually,

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:54.950 align:middle line:90%
there is science behind this.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle line:84%
There a science behind what
the wellness community's been

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:90%
saying for a number of years.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:90%
We just need to marry them up.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.920 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:08.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm reading Dr. Greger's
"How Not To Die."

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of it?

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.430 align:middle line:90%
It is a fantastic book.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greger is probably
someone after my own heart.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.410 align:middle line:84%
He is a medical professional,
he's done the medical training,

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and he's come to
the same conclusions

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
about how nutrient dense
food is the key to health.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And he's basically
systematically gone

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
through in his
book different ways

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:84%
in which we can prevent
and treat disease,

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:90%
which is amazing, right?

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.850 align:middle line:90%
There's a clear bias towards--

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
we're saying he's very much
in the plant-based diet,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:90%
very much in veganism.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I think someone
from the meat world

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.390 align:middle line:84%
must have annoyed him,
like, 20 years ago,

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.743 align:middle line:84%
and he's basically made
it his goal in life

00:17:42.743 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:84%
to completely destroy
the meat industry.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.230 align:middle line:84%
But that aside, what
he says in the book,

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:90%
everything is evidence based.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.638 align:middle line:84%
The links, the research
is amazing for someone

00:17:50.638 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:84%
who's geeky like me
and likes to read paper

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
after paper to make sure they're
doing their patients no harm,

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:90%
it's great.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Phenomenal book, and
I'd encourage everyone

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.808 align:middle line:90%
to read it with an open mind.

00:18:00.808 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Take everything with
a pinch of salt.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Even stuff that I say I always
encourage people to take it

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:07.060 align:middle line:84%
with a pinch of salt.
One thing that's

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:84%
quite humbling about
this whole journey

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:84%
is medical professionals
aren't always right.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:90%
We're not always right.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's recognizing that and
being a skeptic of ourselves

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that we actually
learn and we progress

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
as a scientific community,
as a well community,

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:84%
as people that are trying
to instigate change

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:90%
around the world, globally.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.942 align:middle line:84%
This is much bigger
than individuals.

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:84%
This is much bigger than
medical institutions.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge, huge project.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think just having
that perspective really

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:84%
is the instigator
for a lot of change.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.728 align:middle line:90%
I've been practicing for--

00:18:42.728 --> 00:18:44.395 align:middle line:84%
I studied for six
years, been practicing

00:18:44.395 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:84%
for about seven years, and
I've come to this conclusions

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it's because I had
an open mind through med school

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm not too sure.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.694 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:55.694 --> 00:18:58.660 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.845 align:middle line:90%
It's actually meditation.

00:18:59.845 --> 00:19:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's something
that I'm trying

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate a lot more
in what I tell patients.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So I start with
food because I think

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.485 align:middle line:84%
it's a delicious introduction
into the wellness industry.

00:19:10.485 --> 00:19:12.110 align:middle line:84%
If I can convince
you that this food is

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.777 align:middle line:84%
going to be healthy
for you, maybe you'd

00:19:13.777 --> 00:19:14.750 align:middle line:90%
be open to other ideas.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is mindfulness.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.682 align:middle line:84%
So mindfulness, meditation,
those sorts of practices

00:19:21.682 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:90%
are really, really important.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm tired and
I'm feeling a bit groggy,

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:84%
or I'm thinking about, well,
maybe a coffee will perk me up,

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:30.960 align:middle line:90%
I sit in my chair.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:90%
I find a quiet space.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.910 align:middle line:84%
It's quite hard in London,
but I find a quiet space,

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.640 align:middle line:84%
close my eyes, and I have this
active restful period where

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I concentrate on breathing,
try and empty my mind,

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.170 align:middle line:90%
but not try too hard.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And I just I just
let everything flow

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:90%
and just calm my inner state.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I find after that
10-minute or 11-minute period,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:90%
I feel really refreshed.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:90%
It's quite interesting.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I was taught to meditate when my
mom back when I was a teenager.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.430 align:middle line:84%
You can tell she's
the alternative type.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I was taught to
meditate back then.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:90%
I kind of forgot the practice.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in Sydney,
I met a guy, Tim Brown,

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.320 align:middle line:90%
who you might know.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:84%
He taught me how
to meditate again,

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:90%
and I spent a weekend with him.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And just working
on breath work is

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.068 align:middle line:84%
something that's incredibly,
incredibly powerful.

00:20:18.068 --> 00:20:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And there is the scientific
evidence behind it as well.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.370 align:middle line:84%
There's some research
that Dr. Deepak Chopra

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.000 align:middle line:84%
did with the UCSD looking
at telomerase activity

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:84%
after telling people to
meditate for six weeks.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Six weeks, that's unheard of.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And affecting your
genetic makeup

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:84%
through telomerase
activity, it's

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.060 align:middle line:84%
mind boggling,
absolutely mind boggling.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.433 align:middle line:84%
But mindfulness-- and
there's tons of apps

00:20:40.433 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that I tell people
to use as well.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:42.788 align:middle line:90%
It's a great tool.

00:20:42.788 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a really great tool.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm definitely on team smoothie.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So I would never want
to drink more than I

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.610 align:middle line:90%
can eat in a single sitting.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So even when I do a smoothie,
all the different recipes I do,

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I put half a banana in, or I
put a little bit of date in,

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.090 align:middle line:84%
or I put a little bit
of apple or berries

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.930 align:middle line:84%
because the sugar content, even
though it's a natural sugar

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's paired with minerals
and vitamins, the antioxidants,

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:84%
it's still acting as
a sugar in your body.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's still like the
refined white stuff.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm definitely
on team smoothie.

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:90%
How do I break my fast?

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So in the mornings,
I do it very gently,

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.657 align:middle line:90%
and I do it with a green drink.

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sound like a proper
alternative hippie right now.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:84%
But a green drink, and it's got
it's spirulina, chlorella in,

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.405 align:middle line:84%
a bit of Himalayan
rock salt as well.

00:21:39.405 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I have that first
thing in the morning.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I have about a liter
of it, and I've always

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.897 align:middle line:84%
done that, actually,
about just under a liter.

00:21:44.897 --> 00:21:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So I've got my hydration quota
for the day straightaway.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.770 align:middle line:84%
then like I probably
exercised fasted,

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:51.870 align:middle line:90%
and then I have my shower.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.578 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll have
something quite light.

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So this week, actually, I've
started just boiling an egg,

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and then having a
green salad with that

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:84%
with some extra virgin olive
oil and a little bit of spices.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people find that
quite counterintuitive

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.450 align:middle line:84%
because they're used to having
a sweet cereal or something

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
sweet in the morning
to get them going.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I find that's probably the
worst thing you want to do.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So I do something very
low sugar in the morning

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:84%
because I want to keep
my insulin level stable,

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and I probably have a bit
more fat in the morning

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.460 align:middle line:84%
as well because that's what
I kind of want to burn off.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.572 align:middle line:84%
When I ask someone about their
diet, I say, how's your diet?

00:22:25.572 --> 00:22:26.780 align:middle line:90%
And they say, it's all right.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty healthy.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And I say, tell me what
you had for breakfast.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Cereal, toast, milky
coffee with sugar.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Alarm bells are ringing.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.110 align:middle line:90%
What did you have for lunch?

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:90%
Sandwich, maybe two sandwiches.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.140 align:middle line:90%
What did you have dinner.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sometimes I treat myself.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.510 align:middle line:90%
I'll have a pasta dish.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just thinking,
it's carb, carb, carb.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I see a
patient, I'm kind

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.418 align:middle line:84%
of visualizing their insulin
level, their glucose level,

00:22:49.418 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and there's just
huge spikes, spikes.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're never allow
your insulin to go down.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:55.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the problem,
and this is why

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.230 align:middle line:90%
we rely on caffeinated drinks.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:84%
This is why we rely on
snacking and craving.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.267 align:middle line:84%
We reach for those sweets,
and this is a problem.

00:23:03.267 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I see it in the NHS a
lot of the time, where

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:84%
the nurses go for the
chocolates, and the doctors

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.968 align:middle line:90%
And I used to be one of them.

00:23:09.968 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, so I have
a focus when I tell

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.630 align:middle line:90%
patients what I do it myself--

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:84%
nuts, seeds, high fats in
the morning, lots of protein,

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be good.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.921 align:middle line:90%
You'll be sweet for the day.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.270 align:middle line:84%
My legacy-- I want my
legacy to be introducing

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.580 align:middle line:84%
the concept of culinary medicine
to medical schools up and down

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:90%
the country.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.463 align:middle line:90%
This is what I want to do.

00:23:34.463 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:84%
This is what I kind
of had an epiphany

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.910 align:middle line:84%
moment of what I meant to be
doing with this whole project.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:84%
At the start it was
just to get-- my aim

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
at the start was to get
1,000 of my patients

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.480 align:middle line:84%
watching the YouTube channels
and changing their diet.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:90%
That was my aim.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm blowing
that out the water.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking a lot, lot bigger.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.980 align:middle line:84%
This is this whole bridge is
a lot bigger than just me.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about changing the emphasis
on nutrition and medicine

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.560 align:middle line:90%
going forward.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I want the future doctors,
the first thing to say

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:90%
is, what are you eating?

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:90%
What are you eating?

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing that
doctors should always ask.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to do that
unless we teach the doctors

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:84%
nutrition and we teach them,
in my opinion, how to cook.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Because If you can
cook, like I can

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and like some of
my colleagues can,

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:84%
you are more likely to inspire
and emphasize the importance

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:90%
of nutrition to your patients.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:84%
You're more likely
to motivate them

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:84%
you're more likely to empower
them and educate them yourself

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.337 align:middle line:84%
because if you're
doing yourself and you

00:24:30.337 --> 00:24:33.038 align:middle line:84%
can see the benefits of it, you
can really reap the benefits

00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:34.580 align:middle line:84%
yourself, you're
going to be shouting

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.520 align:middle line:84%
about it, which is actually
what I'm doing right now, right?

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, that's my focus.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually having
some really cool meetings

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.140 align:middle line:84%
with some people in America
who started a nutrition course.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.588 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, the nutrition
course I want to create

00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:52.880 align:middle line:84%
is something that is accepted
by the medical community,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.140 align:middle line:84%
so it has to be affiliated
with universities.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:84%
It has to be affiliated with
the royal colleges, GPs,

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.808 align:middle line:84%
anesthetists, everyone because
unless you convince them,

00:25:01.808 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
then you're not going
to convince everyone.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that's essentially
what I want to do,

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:11.540 align:middle line:84%
the pioneering face of
nutrition medicine in the UK.
