00:00:26.507 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, James here
from "Food Matters,"

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and welcome to this FM TV
special interview with none

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:90%
other than David Avocado Wolfe.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:90%
He is an expert nutritionist.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:84%
He is a raw food
fanatic, I would

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
say, like really
inspiring people

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.055 align:middle line:84%
to eat more raw foods
and super foods.

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the founders of the
Fruit Tree Planting Foundation.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.512 align:middle line:84%
They've planted tens of
thousands of edible fruit trees

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
around the world, a lot of
cacao, I'm pretty certain.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:84%
He is a featured expert in
"Food Matters" and "Hungry

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:84%
for Change" and many other
great films on FM TV,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:90%
so make sure to check them out.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.650 align:middle line:90%
An absolute inspiration.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
It's awesome chatting
with you today, David.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Best ever.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's been, I think
we just figured out,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
11 years since we
first got together

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and we did the interview
for "Food Matters."

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And just what a stellar
experience and life we've

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:90%
had since that time.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So grateful to have had
that moment with you.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the film that
went all the way.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.785 align:middle line:90%
And what a great breakthrough.

00:01:17.785 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was
really fun to do.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad it's still
inspiring people to this day.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:90%
And you had such a great energy.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:90%
So just thank you again.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing experience.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.670 align:middle line:84%
I still get people coming up
to me at airports and saying,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:84%
are you the guy from
that "Food Matters" film?

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.570 align:middle line:90%
It comes up a lot.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So what's happened in
that time in nutrition?

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And so tell me the latest on
sort of like detox cleansing,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:90%
energy boosting, weight loss.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Any sort of breaking research
or superfoods or anything

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that you're into right now
that can help people with that?

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the breakthrough
research projects was done

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
by a French researcher
named Fathi Moussa,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:84%
who was studying
toxicology in mice.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And he was using
a compound called

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.490 align:middle line:84%
the C60 buckminsterfullerene
carbon molecule that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:84%
had been elucidated by Sir Harry
Kroto, who won the Nobel Prize

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.970 align:middle line:90%
for his discoveries in 1996.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
And the toxicology
study was on olive oil,

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.258 align:middle line:84%
and then olive oil with the
buckminsterfullerenes in it,

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:90%
and then a control group.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.425 align:middle line:84%
And I think there was five
overall different groups

00:02:16.425 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:90%
in that study of mice.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And they were still
alive five years later.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.373 align:middle line:84%
Now mice only live
2 and 1/2 years.

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest breakthrough
in longevity research

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:90%
ever in mice.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.042 align:middle line:84%
And it came through
a toxicology study.

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:84%
They weren't trying to
break longevity records.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.477 align:middle line:84%
They were just checking
out, is this stuff toxic?

00:02:31.477 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen if
we give mice this stuff?

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's a repeated discovery
that detoxification is

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:90%
more important than nutrition.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Now that's a shocker.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:84%
That led me down a
rabbit hole of research

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
into charcoal in general,
because basically, the C60

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:90%
molecule is a type of charcoal.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.760 align:middle line:84%
It's when lightning strikes
a tree and burns it,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:90%
that's what's left over.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I started digging
into activated charcoal

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:90%
and its effect on longevity.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Now the crazy news
about that is it

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:84%
has been known for decades,
if not a half century,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
that activated charcoal is
the number one longevity

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
substance in mice, typically,
until the C60 came along.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:90%
We never heard about that.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.817 align:middle line:90%
That's important information.

00:03:14.817 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Like, wait a second.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
the activated charcoal

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:84%
you find in a health
food store that they

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:84%
use in emergency
rooms when somebody

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:84%
comes in from a toxic overdose
of something can extend life.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, you bet.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And it does so in a
way that's shocking.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:84%
It basically does so
because detoxification

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.075 align:middle line:84%
is more important than
nutrition for longevity.

00:03:34.075 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it indicates
that what's getting us

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:90%
in the end is we intoxicate.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:90%
We just drown our own toxins.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And if we keep cleaning our
body, keep cleaning our body,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.470 align:middle line:84%
using the charcoal, using the
fasting, hot, cold therapy,

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
expansion, contraction,
making sure

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:84%
that we don't do anything
that's toxic, right?

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
We go organic and get all
the chemicals and sprays

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and all the household cleaning
products out of our house.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Then we can live longer,
and not only live longer

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:00.612 align:middle line:90%
but live better.

00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Because who cares how
long we're going to live?

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just, when we're 100, we
want to have all our faculties.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:90%
And this is part of that path.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's been the biggest
breakthrough for me recently.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
We want to have the
best day ever every day.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Up until the last day.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Up until the last day.

00:04:15.492 --> 00:04:16.797 align:middle line:90%
And that's the only way.

00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
I'm into prevention.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.838 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things I'm doing now

00:04:19.838 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:84%
is leading people down to
Mexico, Guadalajara, and Cancun

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
on stem cell events
and retreats.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I saw your
post on that recently.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's prevention.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.057 align:middle line:84%
It's like, look, people are
like, why would you need that?

00:04:31.057 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:90%
You're eating all natural foods.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
It's because I
know what happens.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Even if you eat
all natural foods,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you could make it
to 80 or 85 or 88 or 90,

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.170 align:middle line:90%
but that's not my goal.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.555 align:middle line:84%
My goal is to make it hundreds
of years, if it's possible.

00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
I'm going to get

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
there is if I have
to take action.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And I have to see what works.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.857 align:middle line:84%
Those treatments,
by the way, stem

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
cell treatments in the last
11 years saved my mom's life.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I brought my chemist down
there and saved his life.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Like, literally overnight, boom,
went from almost dead to back

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
to life, just like
that, overnight.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful stem
cell treatments are.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.507 align:middle line:84%
We're not always having eaten
the best things in our life,

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:84%
as we become conscious at some
certain point and go, oh, wait,

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:90%
I've got to shift.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.003 align:middle line:84%
So all those mistakes
we've made before, it

00:05:14.003 --> 00:05:15.170 align:middle line:90%
may have damaged our system.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
We may have lost some of our
jing and vital bone marrow life

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.455 align:middle line:84%
And the stem cell treatments can
rejuvenate that and bring that

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
back and possibly even build
something for the future.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what the animal
research indicates,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.445 align:middle line:84%
is that might get an extra
25% of life, which is good.

00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:90%
If you can live to be 100--

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Staggering.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>> --125 is better.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:33.975 --> 00:05:36.350 align:middle line:84%
What are some signs and symptoms
that people might have--

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:84%
if they're eating
the wrong foods,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:84%
how are people going to
know if they're off track?

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>> How you feel is the
most telling barometer

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.232 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on
with your lifestyle.

00:05:47.232 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to be
feeling great all the time.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.898 align:middle line:84%
If you're not feeling
great all the time,

00:05:50.898 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:84%
you don't feel good--
if you're suffering

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:84%
with indigestion and digestive
problems, that's an alert.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
It's your body telling
you, like, hey, look at us.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Wait a second.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.365 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:05:59.365 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
paying attention,

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:84%
you start to go, oh, wait,
my gut's hurting me, right?

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times,
people just suffer through it.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
They just power
through it anyway.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.107 align:middle line:84%
Go to work, do
everything, but their gut

00:06:08.107 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:90%
is really wrenched up.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's just that
ability-- and that's

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:84%
what you guys are
doing, that education,

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
is just bringing people back and
helping people to go, oh, wait,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:90%
something's wrong.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
meditate on your pain,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:84%
it will tell you not
only what is wrong,

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:90%
it also tells you how to fix it.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.380 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.797 align:middle line:84%
Developing that
body intelligence,

00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:90%
it's such an important skill.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a very important skill,
and it's one of the things that

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.680 align:middle line:90%
has been taken away from us.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:90%
And so it's like our birthright.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's claim it back.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.340 align:middle line:84%
You've become this
sort of poster boy--

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:84%
not a great use of the
word, but it is great--

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:90%
for Nutribullet and blending.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, unless people--

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.203 align:middle line:84%
if people haven't seen
your face in this interview

00:06:46.203 --> 00:06:48.453 align:middle line:84%
and they live in America,
they're hiding under a rock.

00:06:48.453 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, honestly, you've
just blasted the airwaves.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And I love it because
you're getting people

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:84%
to have more powerful liquid
nutrition, plants, fruits,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:90%
vegetables.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So why is it that
blending is so important?

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Why is there such
a craze around it?

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.125 align:middle line:90%
And why is it so great?

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And what should people be
doing with their blender?

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that's great
about blending is you keep all

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.682 align:middle line:90%
the fiber, and you need fiber.

00:07:10.682 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the great
untold stories in nutrition,

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:84%
is the fiber is what
pushes the meat through,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.868 align:middle line:84%
pushes the cheese through,
pushes the eggs through.

00:07:16.868 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:90%
There's no fiber in eggs.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:90%
There's no fiber in cheese.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:90%
There's no fiber in meat.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So you need something to get
everything moving through.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.338 align:middle line:84%
And that's just an important
first step for everybody

00:07:24.338 --> 00:07:26.600 align:middle line:84%
because we're usually
having, like, people

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:90%
start with bacon and eggs.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle line:90%
But where's the fiber?

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.787 align:middle line:90%
We need that fiber.

00:07:31.787 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:84%
If we juice, we're
getting rid of the fiber.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:90%
Blending keeps it.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:84%
What about the power of getting
five or six or seven fruits

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:90%
and vegetables into our diet?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.868 align:middle line:84%
University of College
London did a study,

00:07:41.868 --> 00:07:43.285 align:middle line:84%
and they found out
that people who

00:07:43.285 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:84%
had five fruits and
vegetables in their diet

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
were healthier than the
people who had four.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
had six were healthier

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:90%
than the people who had five.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.130 align:middle line:84%
The people who had
seven were healthier

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:90%
than the people who had six.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:90%
And it went all the way up.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I think the study went up to
nine fruits and vegetables.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Those people were actually the
healthiest in the population.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:84%
We found in our research
with Nutribullet

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.575 align:middle line:84%
that when somebody says
they're eating their fruits

00:08:01.575 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables, they're
usually eating two.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.540 align:middle line:90%
You need five, at least.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the Nutribullet was
a way of actually really

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:84%
for real getting the five,
which is different than saying

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.225 align:middle line:90%
you got the five.

00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:90%
Those are different things.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we get such
incredible testimonials all

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.132 align:middle line:90%
the time non-stop.

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Because people are
really suddenly going,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:90%
whoa, I'm getting the fiber.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting the phytonutrients.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting the chlorophyll.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.207 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting the carotenoids.

00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting the anthocyanins.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting the
electrolytes for real.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
>> So if people want to
really just go for it,

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:35.076 align:middle line:84%
transform their health, would
you recommend just I'm going

00:08:35.076 --> 00:08:37.672 align:middle line:84%
to go liquid five, seven days,
just blend everything up,

00:08:37.672 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
lots of fruits, lots
of vegetable-- well,

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.485 align:middle line:90%
vegetables and fruits.

00:08:40.485 --> 00:08:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not fruits and
vegetables, right?

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:84%
You want to keep it more
low sugar, lots of greens.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> What's your general
recommendation for someone who

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:90%
wants to do that?

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> In the beginning, it's good
to have fruits in there just

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:90%
to get you doing it.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And then it's just a
step by step process.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Usually the first month,
you're doing more fruits

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:90%
in that Nutribullet.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
As time goes on, you
want more vegetables.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
You want more of
the other stuff.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:90%
You want more hemp seeds.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.270 align:middle line:84%
You want more things
that are more nutritive

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.953 align:middle line:84%
aren't just giving
you a sugar rush.

00:09:03.953 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the great
breakthrough right there,

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:84%
is that we can't actually
get that into our diet

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and do it in a way
that is exciting.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And especially with
kids, it's fascinating.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Kids are excited to get that
Nutribullet out and play

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:15.780 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And another thing, too, is with
Asperger's and autistic kids,

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
getting them excited
about nutrition,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
the Nutribullet is very
helpful in that regard.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.515 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have a lot of
experience with that.

00:09:24.515 --> 00:09:27.210 align:middle line:84%
It's been part of our
process over the years,

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.900 align:middle line:84%
is just dealing with those kids
and parents who have complaints

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
about, like, my kids are not
going to eat any of this stuff.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's much easier for a
child with autism or a child

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
with Asperger's to
blend and drink the food

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:90%
than to chew through a salad.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Mm, great.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.768 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little bit about
energy, vitality, weight loss.

00:09:47.768 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the World
Health Organization

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.768 align:middle line:84%
has come out recently and said
the three biggest challenges

00:09:51.768 --> 00:09:54.830 align:middle line:84%
facing humanity is like obesity
and diabetes-- diabesity,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:84%
basically those two-- and
then mental health conditions.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think coupled
with that, there's

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
like a whole energy
fatigue issue

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:84%
thing going on because of the
way that we live generally.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And people want
to fix that fast.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.852 align:middle line:84%
So I know you're
big into smoothies.

00:10:07.852 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:90%
What should people be adding?

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Is it all about the
alkalyzing greens?

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.978 align:middle line:90%
Is it about superfoods?

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:13.520 align:middle line:84%
What sort of things
do you recommend?

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, first, first
things first is energy.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Energy comes from the way
that you are respiring, right?

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the
inspiration, the breathing

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:84%
is very important
part of energy.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Taking deep breaths,
30 deep breaths a day,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.540 align:middle line:84%
that's probably the number
one thing for energy

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.210 align:middle line:84%
is just get away
from everything,

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.010 align:middle line:90%
go out and take 30 deep breaths.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:84%
If you start digging deeper
into chronic fatigue syndrome,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of viral
connections to chronic fatigue

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:84%
syndrome, especially
cytomegalovirus,

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:84%
which is herpes 6,
which comes up a lot.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And people are
overrun with viruses,

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.393 align:middle line:84%
and so they can't manage
to get the energy up.

00:10:52.393 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when you got
to start looking at like,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.877 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's get some
garlic in there.

00:10:56.877 --> 00:10:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's get some things
that are natural

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
antivirals into our diet, into
the teas, into our herbology.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, we can start
to guide ourselves out of that.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.822 align:middle line:84%
Cat's Claw, for example,
is an invasive species.

00:11:07.822 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And that tells you
something, by the way.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Invasive species are
very powerful herbs.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And Cat's Claw, Pau
d'Arco combination,

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:84%
an ancient Amazonian combo, is
very good antiviral, antifungal

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:90%
combo and delicious as a tea.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Some people are going
to jump into juices,

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:84%
or some are going to jump
into Nutriblast smoothies.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.305 align:middle line:84%
And some people
are going to jump

00:11:28.305 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:90%
into tea because they're more--

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:84%
that's the way they've
got natural skills

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.848 align:middle line:90%
in certain areas.

00:11:33.848 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to be able to
address each one of those.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And back in the old days,
doing lots of garlic,

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:84%
very powerful to
get a lot of garlic

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:41.915 align:middle line:90%
moving through your system.

00:11:41.915 --> 00:11:44.742 align:middle line:84%
Not recommended before
work, not recommended

00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:84%
when you're going to be
around a lot of other people.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But if you can do
that on a weekend,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:84%
if you're away from people, and
just get a good dose of garlic

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:84%
through your system, this
is 39 natural antibiotics,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
one of most powerful
antivirals going.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
In general, raw food
has more energy in it

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:90%
than cooked food, period.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way it is.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why animals in
nature can eat very little

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and have so much energy
and are so tough and strong

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:90%
and physically fit.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
As time goes on, you
start to realize that, OK,

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:84%
if I eat less, I'll
have more energy.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So food doesn't necessarily
give you energy as you age.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:90%
It can rob you of energy.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
When you're a child,
it's different.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:84%
When you're young,
teenagers are different.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.522 align:middle line:90%
When you're 21, it's different.

00:12:24.522 --> 00:12:27.950 align:middle line:84%
But when you're 48,
58, 68, then you

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.715 align:middle line:84%
start going, whoa,
if I just eat less--

00:12:30.715 --> 00:12:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, if
you eat less, you're

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to live
longer so you can eat more.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.825 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.825 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So for smoothies in that,
if people are putting things

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.780 align:middle line:84%
in smoothies, what sort of
things would you recommend

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
for the energy weight loss
sort of side of things?

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, I recommend
people get alkaline first.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Celery, cucumber-- that's it.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Celery, cucumber coconut water--

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:90%
simple stuff.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Celery, cucumber
coconut water, lemon,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and just keeping it alkaline,
keeping it something where

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:90%
you go, OK, I think this is--

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.963 align:middle line:84%
I've got to adjust to this
as being the new treat.

00:13:01.963 --> 00:13:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
times, in the old days,

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
our treats were really
heinous, like chocolate

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:84%
icing that who knows what kind
of chemicals were in that?

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And then gradually, you
start to treat yourself

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:84%
with things that are
actually really good for you.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's a prerogative
for me, is helping people

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:84%
to get to that point
where cheating for them

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:27.360 align:middle line:84%
is celery, cucumber, lemon
coconut water, blended.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Cheat day.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cheat.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So with people that are going
through life and they've got

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:84%
these issues, I know you talk a
lot about how toxicity can rob

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:90%
you from a lot of your life.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
How is it that toxins are
having that effect on the body?

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, heavy metals
can interfere with our ATP

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:90%
production and our mitochondria.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.215 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
I hear all the time.

00:13:49.215 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:90%
People come up to me.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.007 align:middle line:90%
I can almost see them.

00:13:51.007 --> 00:13:52.670 align:middle line:84%
It happens a lot
where I've been like,

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.883 align:middle line:90%
that person is coming at me.

00:13:53.883 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I know what they're
coming at me before.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And basically, they
give me this story.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.692 align:middle line:84%
They found me online, or
they saw "Food Matters."

00:13:59.692 --> 00:14:01.983 align:middle line:84%
And they got healthy, and
they transformed their lives,

00:14:01.983 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
but nothing really worked
until they did the heavy metal

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:84%
cleansing, until they took
the zeolites and the clays

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and the charcoals
and did the sweating

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.485 align:middle line:84%
and got the heavy
metals-- essentially,

00:14:11.485 --> 00:14:13.527 align:middle line:84%
according to the theory,
get the heavy metals out

00:14:13.527 --> 00:14:15.440 align:middle line:84%
of the receptor site so
you can get zinc back

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:90%
into the receptor sites.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the problem right
there, is zinc gets booted out

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and you get cadmium into
those receptor sites.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Heavy metal poisoning
is very common.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.538 align:middle line:90%
It's overwhelmingly common.

00:14:27.538 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And the first step is you've
got to get the heavy metals out.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Then we can start
producing energy better,

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.292 align:middle line:84%
and then everything
else will work easier.

00:14:34.292 --> 00:14:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's generally
how we work it.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, heavy metal
cleansing-- chlorella, right?

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, all those detox
things, zeolites and clays

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and charcoals and
chlorella and some

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:84%
of the super rich
chlorophyll sources,

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.280 align:middle line:84%
including wheat grass
and spirulina and blue

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:84%
green algae and marine
phytoplanktons, and that's

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:84%
how we start to get
to a point where

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
we start flipping that so
our body can help itself.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is important, too,
in detoxifying ourselves

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.533 align:middle line:84%
and getting more energy
and rejuvenating ourselves.

00:15:04.533 --> 00:15:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is understanding
that your body

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:84%
will do what it needs to do
when it has the energy to do so.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And it has the
substances to do it.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Your body's always
trying to heal itself.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:84%
It's always trying
to fix everything.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Just laying off and just
like, OK, skip dinner tonight,

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:90%
let my body heal itself.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Let me just lay down and rest
for 12 hours with my eyes

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.105 align:middle line:84%
closed, can do wonderful
thing for healing.

00:15:27.105 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's amazing how simple
it is, really, isn't it?

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Very simple, very basic.

00:15:30.975 --> 00:15:33.100 align:middle line:84%
We like to throw the
superfoods and the super herbs

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:90%
in on top of everything.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's really actually
much simpler than that.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Resting more, resting
with eyes closed,

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.710 align:middle line:84%
being grounded, being on the
ground, resting at the beach,

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.710 align:middle line:84%
laying on the sand,
getting in the ocean,

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
eating less, fasting, using the
sunshine as food, sun gazing,

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:84%
getting that last four minutes
of the sun in the evening

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.020 align:middle line:84%
or the first four minutes
of the sun in the morning,

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.370 align:middle line:90%
barefoot on stone.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
aspects of health.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Powerful.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about foods, we
talk about adding more foods.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:06.350 align:middle line:90%
I know you're huge on adding.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:90%
I love that philosophy.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:90%
When you brought that up--

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I think I was really
in "Hungry for Change."

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:90%
You said restriction is out.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:84%
It's all about adding
now because it's fun.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:90%
People can do it.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.965 align:middle line:84%
You don't take their meat
and potatoes or their toast

00:16:16.965 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:90%
or their coffee away.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.468 align:middle line:84%
You just say, add in more
water, add in more super foods.

00:16:20.468 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But there is a fair
bit of discussion

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
now around people
that are having

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:84%
a lot of success
eliminating things

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.370 align:middle line:90%
like grains out of their diet.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And even I've been speaking
with someone like Novak Djokovic

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:84%
recently, he's
famous tennis player.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Really good, but he shot
to this huge performance

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.040 align:middle line:84%
curve went up because
he gave up gluten.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, I don't
think this is a coincidence.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:90%
This is for real.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And you look at other
athletes as an example

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:84%
from a performance
perspective of how do you

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:90%
be a better human?

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:84%
You perform better, whatever
you do-- mum, dad, athlete.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Tom Brady as well--

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.550 align:middle line:84%
pretty much no grains, from
what I understand of his diet.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Kelly Slater, very clean, no
grains, lots of coconut water,

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:90%
fresh foods.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.138 align:middle line:84%
Is there something in
eliminating grains?

00:17:01.138 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Is there a bigger
story around grains

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.805 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't really know?

00:17:03.805 --> 00:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know there's this
whole agriculture thing.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:06.890 align:middle line:90%
I'd love your opinion on it.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:07.690 align:middle line:90%
It's been a while.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, grains are
seeds of grasses.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And grasses are a human food,
but they're a small part

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:90%
of our overall diet in nature.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:90%
You can eat and chew up grass.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:84%
The most edible part of grass
is either the seed or the corm,

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:23.260 align:middle line:90%
which is the root.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.008 align:middle line:84%
And grass corms, like
bunched grass corms,

00:17:26.008 --> 00:17:27.050 align:middle line:90%
are actually pretty good.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.870 align:middle line:90%
They taste like corn--

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:84%
corm as differentiated
from corn.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And corms can be great food
sources if you're surviving.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:90%
But we're not surviving, right?

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle line:84%
We're pretty much at this point,
we have an abundance of food.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's good to know
that grasses can be foods.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And their products
like their seeds,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
which is what grains are, and
their roots can help us out.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.443 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really
need that anymore.

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.568 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like soybeans.

00:17:50.568 --> 00:17:51.557 align:middle line:90%
We don't need soybeans.

00:17:51.557 --> 00:17:52.390 align:middle line:90%
Like, get rid of it.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just too toxic
for most people.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's get the
stuff that we know

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.900 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the
right thing for us.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes
to grains, it's

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
like, what are we
getting from it?

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's like a complex carb.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some
protein in there.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.490 align:middle line:90%
OK, we can get that from quinoa.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
We can get that
from sweet potato.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't need it,
and when you look

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:84%
at the highest
performing athletes,

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
you'll see sweet
potatoes in there.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we know.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.727 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's usually
what I recommend for athletes,

00:18:17.727 --> 00:18:21.820 align:middle line:84%
is get off all grains, get off
all complex carbs like bread,

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.072 align:middle line:90%
and get on to sweet potato.

00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And just make sure you have
one or two sweet potatoes

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:90%
a day as your complex carb.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that--

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Easy, simple.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.505 align:middle line:84%
And sweet potatoes
are subtly anabolic.

00:18:31.505 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the
pathways there-- we

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.980 align:middle line:84%
have never elucidated it
in a peer-reviewed study,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:84%
but the pathways there
from the raw materials

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:84%
of the sweet potato
to testosterone,

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.940 align:middle line:84%
the raw materials of the
sweet potato to, for in women,

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:90%
progesterone.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's turn our attention to
the gut for a little bit here.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of this
part of the health

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.200 align:middle line:84%
well that never
got spoken about.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And like, two years
ago, it was like, boom.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:90%
The microbiome, its everything.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's just exploded
in popularity.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.565 align:middle line:90%
It's where our immunity is.

00:18:58.565 --> 00:19:01.210 align:middle line:84%
It's where everything
starts and ends.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.627 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on it?

00:19:02.627 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the microbiome
is everything.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.340 align:middle line:84%
We're basically
farming bacteria, is

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:90%
what we've finally realized.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.120 align:middle line:84%
We have more DNA
in our gut bacteria

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.450 align:middle line:84%
than we have in our body,
that this farm that we are

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:84%
needs these bacteria as
an adjunct to creating

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
healthy skin, as an
adjunct to creating

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.668 align:middle line:84%
healthy digestion, healthy
epithelial cells, all

00:19:21.668 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:84%
the way to the coating of
cells, all the way down

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.370 align:middle line:90%
through our gut lining.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.570 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the excretion
of these substances

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.810 align:middle line:84%
that is most beneficial
to our longevity for sure.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:84%
When I did the original
research on longevity

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.520 align:middle line:84%
25 years ago at the
Price-Pottenger Nutrition

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Foundation in San Diego, one
of the things that came up

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly-- this was
before the internet-- was

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
in all the great
longevity cases in Europe,

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:84%
for example, every
single case, there

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:90%
was a fermented food there.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.770 align:middle line:84%
A cultured food, a
probiotic food-- every case.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that really
stuck with me from that time

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.660 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.122 align:middle line:84%
So I stayed with the probiotics,
but ultimately, really,

00:19:58.122 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:84%
the best way is to
culture your own food.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Take your vegetable,
shred them up.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Fill them up with a
dilute apple juice.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.443 align:middle line:84%
Put in your L.
plantarum, for example.

00:20:06.443 --> 00:20:08.235 align:middle line:84%
Just make it super
easy, just one bacteria.

00:20:08.235 --> 00:20:10.595 align:middle line:84%
Just throw that in
there as a powder.

00:20:10.595 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Stir that up, put a
little sea salt in there.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Mash that all up.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Put a little lid on there
that can breathe out,

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:84%
so as that thing
ferments it pops off,

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:84%
you don't want stuff
to be able to get in,

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:84%
but you want the
gases to escape.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.650 align:middle line:90%
And then let it sit for a week.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you can get your
live bacteria that way.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of fermented
food is what creates longevity.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
It's also those excretions
create health as well.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And we can get some of those
excretions in other ways,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.130 align:middle line:84%
from our great herbs
and great foods.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And when they're that small
and secreted by bacteria,

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:90%
they get used.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.110 align:middle line:90%
They get absorbed.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of a
nature-based philosophy

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:90%
question for you here.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.160 align:middle line:90%
I really love musing on this.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:84%
How did we accidentally
discover how to ferment foods?

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what a weird
turning point in humanity.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:84%
It was like, we didn't
have refrigeration.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.100 align:middle line:84%
We started becoming
hunter-gatherer-gardeners.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Then we had excess crops of,
say, cabbage, for instance.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:90%
We threw it in a pile.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.215 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
happened there?

00:21:06.215 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:84%
How do we develop
this relationship

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.313 align:middle line:90%
with bacteria and fermentation?

00:21:09.313 --> 00:21:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
left field question

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:90%
but I'd love your thoughts.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.217 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it probably had
something to do with mixing

00:21:14.217 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:84%
our spit and saliva into our
food early on, especially

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.030 align:middle line:84%
for children, and then finding
out that those cultures could

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.300 align:middle line:84%
survive on longer and could
be used for more and more

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:90%
vegetables or more things.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Because you see that more in
indigenous and original peoples

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
that they still use their
own saliva to ferment things.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
how it started.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you're just playing
around with substances

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.770 align:middle line:84%
in nature-- for example, grapes
and then berries and then

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:90%
mugwort--

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just thinking of
some things in my local flora

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and fauna and some of the
different leaves that you eat.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:84%
You find out that there's
different types of bacteria

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:90%
on each one of them, right?

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.437 align:middle line:84%
So grapes are going to
be broken down by yeast.

00:21:57.437 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And your berries are
going to be broken down

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.650 align:middle line:90%
by bacteria and yeast.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.108 align:middle line:84%
And then so that
you'll see, you'll

00:22:02.108 --> 00:22:05.330 align:middle line:84%
start to notice that there's
different natural bacteria that

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
are already there on that grape
that if you leave it alone,

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:84%
they're going to digest that
food right there on the spot.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:90%
They'll eat it themselves.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And so you start
to go, oh, OK, this

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.090 align:middle line:84%
is probably how
wines got started.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Because if you just mash up all
the grapes and let them sit,

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:84%
the yeast that's already there
on the grape surface, which is

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:90%
like the surface of our skin--

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:84%
it has its own probiotics
on it, just as the grape

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.762 align:middle line:90%
has its own probiotics on it--

00:22:29.762 --> 00:22:31.970 align:middle line:84%
it starts to-- you start to
see, oh, OK, I could just

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:90%
let this thing eat itself.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And then let me just take
the byproduct of that.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:40.085 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm sure that ancient
people figured out that there's

00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:90%
two great benefits of that.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.358 align:middle line:84%
One is you get to
keep the food longer.

00:22:43.358 --> 00:22:45.816 align:middle line:84%
So in grape season, you only
get a certain amount of seeds,

00:22:45.816 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:90%
and then it's gone.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you want grapes
longer than the season,

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:90%
that's one way to do it.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing is
that you will get effects

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.685 align:middle line:84%
from it that you can't get
from eating the grapes.

00:22:54.685 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just talking
about the alcohol effects.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about there's,
like, resveratrol.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Resveratrol in grapes is
pretty much unavailable

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:90%
when you eat it.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.887 align:middle line:84%
When you eat grapes,
it's not going to happen.

00:23:03.887 --> 00:23:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But when you
dissolve it and when

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:84%
it's dissolved in
the alcohol that's

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.430 align:middle line:84%
created by the fermentation
of that grapes,

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.320 align:middle line:84%
that resveratrol can be
driven in by the alcohol

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.520 align:middle line:90%
and made bio available.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is the theory as to
why Mediterranean peoples live

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.910 align:middle line:84%
longer, is because
they're getting

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
these fermented products of
the grapes, the phenols, one

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:84%
of the most famous
being resveratrol,

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:84%
into their body in
a way that's usable.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:90%
And it makes it in.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.773 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
part of it, too.

00:23:29.773 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad I asked
that question.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Great one.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It wasn't on the sheet.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.078 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't on the sheet.

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the ideal diet.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
a tough question.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I know, but I want to
hear your sort of updated

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.310 align:middle line:84%
or the same version of, like,
if you had to sort of prescribe

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:84%
general dietary recommendations
for the human populace--

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:90%
now this is a tough one.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no, it's easy for me.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.747 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing that all the time.

00:23:52.747 --> 00:23:53.547 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:53.547 --> 00:23:55.685 align:middle line:84%
>> But I know we have
biochemically individuality.

00:23:55.685 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:84%
We live in different parts of
the world, all sort of things.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But what is your
general recommendation

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:84%
for the human species and how
they should nourish themselves?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You should eat
a plant-based diet.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.390 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't mean only plants.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:84%
You should eat whatever
animal foods that are

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.650 align:middle line:90%
going to keep you in balance.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And we do the
opposite, of course.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We eat all animal
foods and then try

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to use plant foods
to save ourselves.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.808 align:middle line:84%
And everything's
always the opposite

00:24:15.808 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:90%
than what we were taught.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.332 align:middle line:84%
So using plant-based
foods-- if you

00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:84%
find that you can be
a vegetarian, great.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.800 align:middle line:84%
If you find that you can
be a vegan, wonderful.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:84%
You find that you
can't, OK, great.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:84%
But you still need
plants for the fibers.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.615 align:middle line:84%
You still need plants
for the phytochemicals.

00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:84%
You still need plants for
the chlorophyll, right?

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's just that basic
balance of finding out, OK,

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.377 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to
have a meal, let's

00:24:33.377 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:90%
try to simplify that meal.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's say I was going to have--

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat fish,
but let's say it's

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.390 align:middle line:90%
like fish and rice and salad.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.395 align:middle line:84%
Let's just make
it fish and salad.

00:24:41.395 --> 00:24:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Get the rice out of there
because that complex carb

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:84%
is going to mix in a way
that's going to disturb

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:90%
the digestion of the protein.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole food
combining concept.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Very important key concept
if you want more energy,

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:54.590 align:middle line:90%
that's for sure.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:84%
If you just food
combine correctly,

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.100 align:middle line:84%
if you want just more
rice and salad, OK, great.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Have rice and salad, but keep
that fish out of there, right?

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.142 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be
one or the other.

00:25:02.142 --> 00:25:04.517 align:middle line:84%
And instead of having, for
example, three different types

00:25:04.517 --> 00:25:05.850 align:middle line:90%
of complex carbs, just have one.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:06.725 align:middle line:90%
Just have more of it.

00:25:06.725 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:90%
You want two sweet potatoes?

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:09.702 align:middle line:84%
Great, have two sweet
potatoes and a salad.

00:25:09.702 --> 00:25:11.173 align:middle line:90%
And keep it simple like that.

00:25:11.173 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:84%
When you have salad, salad
is the great neutralizer.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the great way of helping
that food just go through you

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.510 align:middle line:90%
like it's an antidote.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:84%
If you just ate sweet
potato, it's kind of like,

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.110 align:middle line:90%
it's a little too--

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.013 align:middle line:90%
it's a little too carb-based.

00:25:26.013 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And you need that fiber to
help move it all through.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:84%
If you just had fish, OK,
you're just too much protein

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:31.410 align:middle line:90%
sitting there.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
You need that carb to help
move, or you need that fiber

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.125 align:middle line:90%
to help move that all through.

00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:84%
What else can be said as
general dietary recommendations?

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Once you get your food sorted
out, you go to quality, right?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.630 align:middle line:84%
So instead of being on the GMO
and you go to conventional, you

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.355 align:middle line:84%
go to organic, and
you go to biodynamic,

00:25:45.355 --> 00:25:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and you go to homegrown,
you go to wild food.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So there's always that
step-by-step progression there.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.920 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to the next
thing beyond that is then

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:90%
you come to the superfoods.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:84%
You realize, OK, I don't want
to just eat like whatever.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.347 align:middle line:84%
I want to have like the
best thing of all time.

00:26:00.347 --> 00:26:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And so you start
looking at superfoods

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.690 align:middle line:84%
that makes sense to you that
might even be local to you--

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:90%
aloe vera, goji berries, cacao.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm a vanilla grower, so I
can put that herb in there.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
to herbs in a second.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.147 align:middle line:84%
I like to throw in
the super greens,

00:26:14.147 --> 00:26:16.480 align:middle line:84%
the marine phytoplankton, the
chlorella, the spirulinas,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:84%
the blue green algaes,
hemp seed, chia seed.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:21.940 align:middle line:90%
So we start adding those things.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And once we've established
that basic diet,

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.740 align:middle line:84%
that plant-based diet,
and once we've established

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:84%
the quality of that
diet and we understand

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.118 align:middle line:84%
that OK, if I'm going to have
a meal, let's keep it simple.

00:26:31.118 --> 00:26:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Is it just fish and rice?

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.345 align:middle line:84%
No, it's fish and salad or
rice and salad, but not both.

00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And then we go to
the next level.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:90%
We'll be on super foods.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And that is super herbs.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Then we start getting into
the herbal tea world, which

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.910 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, I could take in the most
powerful herbs in the world.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.907 align:middle line:84%
Why would I take in something
that's herb number 333?

00:26:48.907 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what that is.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:51.978 align:middle line:84%
I want the most powerful
herb that's around me.

00:26:51.978 --> 00:26:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And then when I'm
done with that one,

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.853 align:middle line:90%
I want the second most powerful.

00:26:54.853 --> 00:26:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to start building
prevention for the future

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.150 align:middle line:84%
so that I'm preventing
disease for the future,

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and I'm preventing
aging for the future

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and preventing loss of
energy for the future.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And we call that
the treasures, where

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.670 align:middle line:90%
you're nourishing treasures.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's ultimately where
you go as your strategy.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Eventually you come
to a point of let

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:84%
me just basically get on the
superfoods and the super herbs.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have some
food maybe once a day

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.765 align:middle line:84%
or maybe once every few
days, because I'm out

00:27:23.765 --> 00:27:24.640 align:middle line:90%
socially or whatever.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, that's
where we're going,

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:84%
is we're getting
to the super herbs

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.790 align:middle line:84%
as part of a
prevention strategy.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.740 align:middle line:90%
And all that's just food.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.553 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't include
water, right?

00:27:34.553 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So in the morning, we have
water and charcoal and sea salt

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and things that detoxify
us and hydrate us.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And maybe even later, have
water, sea salt, or water,

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:45.040 align:middle line:84%
sea salt, and charcoal in
order to hydrate and detoxify.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And that way, we
can keep ourselves

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:84%
going strong and healthy
without doing too much damage

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:90%
to our body as we age.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful answer.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.050 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.012 align:middle line:90%
It'll relate to a lot of people.

00:27:57.012 --> 00:27:59.470 align:middle line:84%
It makes it easy for people to
approach nutrition, which is

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.600 align:middle line:90%
always your work, your mission.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're a food guy
and I'm a food guy.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.800 align:middle line:90%
I love food, you love food.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:84%
But I want to know
how much you're

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.450 align:middle line:84%
on the page of acknowledging
how important the mind is.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.822 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more research
coming out about this.

00:28:15.822 --> 00:28:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we share a
lot of great friends,

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.402 align:middle line:84%
like Bruce Lipton or people
in this mind body space.

00:28:20.402 --> 00:28:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
disease, the more research

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.985 align:middle line:84%
I'm finding out is
like, whoa, the mind

00:28:23.985 --> 00:28:25.840 align:middle line:90%
plays such a huge part in it.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Tell me your
thoughts about if you

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.537 align:middle line:84%
think the mind is
powerful and why

00:28:29.537 --> 00:28:30.870 align:middle line:90%
and what in particular about it.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Is it belief systems and values?

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:34.007 align:middle line:90%
Or is it meditation or stress?

00:28:34.007 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And what work are you doing
in that space in particular?

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you're paying
attention to what I'm doing

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.900 align:middle line:84%
with my Facebook page, you're
finding out that that's become

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.317 align:middle line:84%
the dominant thing that we do,
is helping people to change

00:28:43.317 --> 00:28:44.200 align:middle line:90%
their mind.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if there's one
disease that's incurable,

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:90%
it's a closed mind.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, when
people have a closed mind,

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.688 align:middle line:84%
they're pretty much if they
get a doomsday diagnosis,

00:28:53.688 --> 00:28:54.730 align:middle line:90%
they're going to go down.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:55.938 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to make it.

00:28:55.938 --> 00:28:57.397 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that over
and over again.

00:28:57.397 --> 00:28:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to many
doctors around the world

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and asked them that
specific question.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is if somebody is
not open to transforming

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.010 align:middle line:84%
their thoughts about
their condition,

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.550 align:middle line:84%
if they won't change their
mind and they believe that this

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:84%
is a battle they have to fight
and they're basically fighting

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.242 align:middle line:84%
an uphill battle or whatever the
setup is inside their own mind,

00:29:16.242 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:84%
they're usually going
to lose that fight.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:84%
But if they believe
that they can win,

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:84%
if they believe they
can change their mind,

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
they can change their habits,
they can change their life,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.360 align:middle line:84%
they can change their immediate
social environment or even

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:84%
their home environment,
then they usually make it.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And I've also asked
that question.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.012 align:middle line:84%
Will somebody make
it if they believe

00:29:31.012 --> 00:29:33.700 align:middle line:84%
they can, if they change the
people around them to support

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.500 align:middle line:84%
them in their own
healing, if they

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.480 align:middle line:84%
get a pet so that they have
that love to help support them?

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Will they make it?

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.197 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:29:40.197 --> 00:29:42.130 align:middle line:84%
They are two or three
times, even four times,

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.505 align:middle line:84%
more likely to
make it, depending

00:29:43.505 --> 00:29:46.200 align:middle line:84%
on what the disease is
and what the diagnosis is.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.200 align:middle line:90%
I want to say this, too.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is in every case
of a serious condition,

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.358 align:middle line:84%
there always, in my experience,
has been a mental component.

00:29:55.358 --> 00:29:56.650 align:middle line:90%
I can't think of one exception.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.162 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine confronted
me with that many years ago.

00:29:59.162 --> 00:30:00.370 align:middle line:90%
And so I've been watching it.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And every time, there
is a mental component

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.850 align:middle line:84%
to the condition that the
person is dealing with.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to deal with
that, as I've found, is right

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.970 align:middle line:84%
there, you look at
your phone, and boom,

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.900 align:middle line:90%
there's the Facebook page.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's the
positive affirmation

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that caused you to go, oh,
oops, I was in doomsday.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
the best day ever.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:24.130 align:middle line:90%
I forgot.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Let me get back on
to the best day ever.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
original inception

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.990 align:middle line:84%
of why do the Facebook
page the way I do it,

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:84%
was to just bring that
person an uplifting message

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.210 align:middle line:84%
right at that
moment so that they

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:39.620 align:middle line:84%
could transform their lives
and get back on track.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Fear, you touched on it
there-- massive issue.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
fearful because we've

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.120 align:middle line:90%
been taught to be fearful.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're fearful of death,
we're fearful of a disease.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
We're fearful of what
other people think of us.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Fear of success.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Fear of success, fear
of failure, everything.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's
a common thread?

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.440 align:middle line:84%
When you said that
people generally

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:84%
have some sort of emotional
component, do you think there's

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.282 align:middle line:84%
a fear component, or
is there an anxiety?

00:31:01.282 --> 00:31:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Or is there depression?

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.160 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
a common trend there?

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think
fear is a big issue

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people, and
the wealth, for that matter?

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anxiety is
the number one cause

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:84%
of mental neuroses in our
culture and Western culture.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's affecting, if we look
at the numbers, it's 20% to 25%

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.540 align:middle line:84%
of the population is in
fear and anxiety quite a bit

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and is actually even
reaching for medication

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.570 align:middle line:90%
for fear and anxiety.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is one
of the reasons why we've

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.000 align:middle line:84%
had a breakthrough in
America with medical cannabis

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:84%
because people
are realizing, I'd

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:33.230 align:middle line:84%
rather take the cannabis than
these other drugs, whatever

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.310 align:middle line:90%
those drugs are.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's a breakthrough,
but still, the cannabis

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.470 align:middle line:84%
isn't going to get
you out of the fear.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.360 align:middle line:84%
It may help you to
deal with the anxiety,

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.818 align:middle line:84%
but what's going to get you
out of the fear and the anxiety

00:31:43.818 --> 00:31:45.140 align:middle line:90%
is doing the thing.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you will have the
power to strike out boldly

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.350 align:middle line:84%
with courage anyway and
do it anyway, right?

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:54.290 align:middle line:84%
The internet, in the old days,
it was your own internal fears

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.750 align:middle line:84%
about going on TV or what
people would say about you.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.265 align:middle line:90%
Now it's social media trolling.

00:31:58.265 --> 00:32:00.890 align:middle line:84%
People hate you on social media,
so they're going to troll you.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.765 align:middle line:84%
And so people come up
with those fears, like,

00:32:02.765 --> 00:32:04.010 align:middle line:90%
no, I can't succeed.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.660 align:middle line:84%
What if I get
trolled or whatever?

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's that is the same thing
we're dealing with before.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:13.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just do the thing,
strike out with courage,

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.180 align:middle line:90%
and you shall have the power.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful, I love it.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.820 align:middle line:84%
You could talk on
anything, David, honestly.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I love that we're taking this
part of the conversation here.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Meditation and
stress reduction--

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:25.550 align:middle line:90%
big talk about it.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:27.350 align:middle line:84%
We've got a few
films on it on FM TV.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a hot topic right now,
and people get a lot of relief

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.490 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:84%
You talked in a
separate interview

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.820 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about how resting
can be so important, laying

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.832 align:middle line:90%
on the sand.

00:32:38.832 --> 00:32:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
you recommend people do,

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.830 align:middle line:84%
like stress reduction,
meditation, breathwork.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so important for
healing and maintaining health?

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the stress response
we know is an inflammatory

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.587 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:32:49.587 --> 00:32:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's an aging response,
and it's one of those things

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that we have to really look
at our overall biology.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.000 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at our overall
capabilities and realize, OK,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.875 align:middle line:84%
can I really handle
this kind of workload?

00:33:01.875 --> 00:33:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Can I really handle
this kind of stress

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.120 align:middle line:90%
and be healthy at the same time?

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.697 align:middle line:84%
And for some people who are
type A personalities and can

00:33:07.697 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:84%
just power through
it, they can do it.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And some people,
they can't do it.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So we really need to be
honest with ourselves

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and look at our workload and go,
OK, I need to get rid of this.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I need to get rid of that.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:16.000 align:middle line:90%
I need to get rid of this.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I need to get rid
of that in order

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.550 align:middle line:84%
so that I can have the time to
meditate and all that, in order

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.170 align:middle line:84%
that I can have
the time to garden,

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and also to live a
stress free lifestyle.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And with other
people, like for me,

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.160 align:middle line:84%
where I get my stress
reduction is just

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.980 align:middle line:84%
being at home, being in the
garden, being in that orchard,

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.220 align:middle line:84%
being with my trees, that
that's what it's about for me.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a sit in
a yoga room meditator.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm a meditator who is out
there, trimming my cacao trees.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm out there cleaning
up the orchard.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:47.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the meditation for
me, and usually in silence

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.020 align:middle line:90%
by myself.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's the time
of no mind to me.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.140 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not out there,
like, dissecting

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.990 align:middle line:90%
the problems of the day.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm out there just in
a state of no mind.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So I get those same
benefits of meditation.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.732 align:middle line:84%
But I'm doing also
what I love to do.

00:34:00.732 --> 00:34:02.690 align:middle line:84%
It's almost a subconscious
thing at this point.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Like, weeding for me is
like a subconscious thing.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I can weed the
whole garden and not

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:84%
even realize what
I've been doing

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.172 align:middle line:84%
because I've been in a state
of no mind the whole time.

00:34:10.172 --> 00:34:12.170 align:middle line:84%
You really have to know
that about yourself.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just that same
thing as the Greeks said.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Know thyself.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Work on yourself and figure
out, OK, what needs to go?

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.000 align:middle line:90%
And what's good?

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.800 align:middle line:90%
What's serving me?

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:90%
What's not?

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:24.050 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you think-- this is a little
bit of a personal question

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:27.610 align:middle line:84%
here-- that
visualization has been

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.610 align:middle line:84%
a big part of your mission
getting to the world?

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've been at
this now for 20, 25 years,

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.010 align:middle line:90%
and epic monumental effort.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And now you're shifting the
lives of billions of people

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.199 align:middle line:84%
monthly, is seeing
your messaging.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
staggering and amazing.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so, so proud and humbled
to be in your presence again.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.080 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Did you visualize this, David?

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Was this something that
you said, you know what?

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I really, really, really
want to wake people

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.239 align:middle line:90%
up, crack them open.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:52.679 align:middle line:84%
Or was it something you
just applied yourself

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:53.360 align:middle line:90%
and it just happened?

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.160 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to know.

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, it's
definitely two things.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.890 align:middle line:84%
The most important
is goal setting.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, 25 years
ago, I wrote the goal,

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.313 align:middle line:84%
"I capture the
attention of all media."

00:35:03.313 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
what that meant.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:06.050 align:middle line:90%
That was before the internet.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going
to go on TV shows,

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.460 align:middle line:84%
or it was going to be
something like that.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.293 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what--

00:35:10.293 --> 00:35:11.370 align:middle line:90%
I'd have my own TV show.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.790 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea-- my own channel.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:13.910 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't figure
it out back then,

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.250 align:middle line:84%
but I thought nature
will figure it out.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.910 align:middle line:90%
God will figure it out.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Source energy figures it out,
whatever your interpretation

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.550 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.717 align:middle line:84%
And it will happen because
goal setting is something

00:35:21.717 --> 00:35:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe in, and I know that
if I set 100 goals, usually

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I hit around 33% every year.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.110 align:middle line:90%
It's like a rule.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like if I just set 100
and I go back a year later,

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:34.890 align:middle line:84%
it's usually around 30 to 35
of them are hit every year.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so you set a
goal, you get a goal.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.440 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Number two is I
did visualize it.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So when I set goals, I also
visualized those goals.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And capturing the
attention of all media

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:47.420 align:middle line:84%
meant that I needed to
become a very good presenter

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.590 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.215 align:middle line:84%
I needed to understand the
information inside and out

00:35:51.215 --> 00:35:52.730 align:middle line:90%
and needed to apply myself.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.980 align:middle line:84%
I needed to go out and
do thousands of events

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.240 align:middle line:84%
so I would be prepared for
that time when we finally broke

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.270 align:middle line:90%
through and got to all media.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:04.220 align:middle line:90%
And that time is now.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.440 align:middle line:84%
We got there, and
it took 25 years.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.200 align:middle line:84%
God's delays aren't God's
denials, too, by the way.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you get a goal,
sometimes you set a goal,

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.075 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't happen.

00:36:13.075 --> 00:36:14.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's not
happening this year.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it'll happen next year.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it'll happen
five years from now.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.920 align:middle line:84%
But it will eventually
happen, and that's

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:90%
what I've discovered in my life.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I've been setting goals
now for over 30 years.

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Love it.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Great practice.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.060 align:middle line:84%
What words of wisdom
would you have

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.160 align:middle line:84%
for someone who's feeling a
little bit stuck in their life?

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're doing
the right food,

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.490 align:middle line:84%
they think they've
got more work to do,

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:38.117 align:middle line:84%
but they want to achieve more
fulfillment and more passion

00:36:38.117 --> 00:36:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and have a better quality
life, particularly

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:42.050 align:middle line:84%
in that fulfillment and
passion and growth area.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:44.090 align:middle line:84%
What sort of advice would you
have for people around that?

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>> If you set a goal and you
get a goal, you're fulfilled,

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:48.177 align:middle line:90%
especially a big goal.

00:36:48.177 --> 00:36:49.760 align:middle line:84%
20 something years
ago-- it might even

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.718 align:middle line:90%
have been 25 years ago.

00:36:50.718 --> 00:36:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Around that same time, I
wrote an entire script,

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.630 align:middle line:84%
an entire infomercial about
selling a blender on TV.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.790 align:middle line:90%
I wrote an entire book on it.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.440 align:middle line:90%
And it happened.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So that led to an amazing
level of fulfillment.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Can't be taken away from me.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.047 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to do it again.

00:37:07.047 --> 00:37:08.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy with what happened.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.040 align:middle line:84%
It just proved to
me that the dreams

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.040 align:middle line:84%
of a child, my dreams from when
I was five years old of getting

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.650 align:middle line:84%
on TV and doing the
infomercial thing,

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:17.720 align:middle line:84%
that I eventually wrote
out as all my goals

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.390 align:middle line:84%
when I was 22 or 23
years old, and then

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.340 align:middle line:84%
achieved all that
led to a fulfillment.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fulfillment that
can't be taken away from you.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
There's no emotion
that goes around.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what-- the
best word is fulfillment.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:30.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like you feel
something-- is

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.520 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you know something
in this world that works.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:38.947 align:middle line:84%
And that is if anything is worth
having, it's worth working for.

00:37:38.947 --> 00:37:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you go out and you
work hard for that goal.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And you work hard, you
work hard, you work hard,

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.660 align:middle line:90%
and then you achieve it.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.880 align:middle line:90%
You achieve fulfillment.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.690 align:middle line:84%
There's no quick, easy
way to get to fulfillment.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Fulfillment comes from deep
work, deep work raising

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.570 align:middle line:84%
children, for example, deep
work with grandchildren,

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.060 align:middle line:90%
deep work in your career.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.560 align:middle line:84%
That's where
fulfillment comes from.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.540 align:middle line:84%
There's one more to it
I do want to mention.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Farming and gardening
and horticulture--

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that creates fulfillment,
especially over time.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.437 align:middle line:84%
So if you're set on a piece
of land for a long time,

00:38:09.437 --> 00:38:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and you've been growing
things on that land,

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and you've got trees
now that you planted,

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and now they're 10 meters
tall or 20 meters tall,

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.865 align:middle line:84%
and you remember when
they were a seed,

00:38:18.865 --> 00:38:21.073 align:middle line:84%
there's something there that
also brings fulfillment.

00:38:21.073 --> 00:38:23.690 align:middle line:84%
This thing of planting trees
is what led to the Fruit Tree

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Planting Foundation.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:27.590 align:middle line:84%
There's some level
of fulfillment

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that comes from having
put a million trees

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.790 align:middle line:90%
in the ground since 2002.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:33.920 align:middle line:84%
We put a million
trees in the ground.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.990 align:middle line:84%
We've terraformed the
entire big island of Hawaii.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.290 align:middle line:84%
The entire big island of
Hawaii will permanently

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.390 align:middle line:84%
have durians, permanently
have jackfruits,

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:84%
permanently have meringues,
permanently have cacao.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no world cataclysm
that could take it away.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.490 align:middle line:90%
And it was because we did it.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:50.600 align:middle line:90%
We lived and we did it.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
original raw food crew

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:56.445 align:middle line:84%
from San Diego that moved
over to Hawaii that did that.

00:38:56.445 --> 00:38:58.760 align:middle line:84%
That is an incredible
level of fulfillment.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.560 align:middle line:84%
We have changed the big
island of Hawaii forever.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And we've turned many
areas of the big island

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:09.300 align:middle line:84%
that would have been beautiful
for us into food forests now.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.490 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.410 align:middle line:84%
So final question, if the
world was your classroom

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and you're about to
walk out on stage,

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and you had a couple of
minutes to teach them anything,

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:22.400 align:middle line:84%
anything from the treasure
trove of your life learnings,

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.510 align:middle line:90%
what would you teach them?

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I would teach them how
to have the best day ever,

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:27.620 align:middle line:90%
that today is all we got.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's
the worst ever, you

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:84%
can turn it around,
if you keep meditating

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:31.912 align:middle line:90%
on how to turn it around.

00:39:31.912 --> 00:39:33.740 align:middle line:84%
If you keep asking,
how can I take this day

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.397 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into the best
day ever, it can happen.

00:39:36.397 --> 00:39:37.230 align:middle line:90%
It's happened to me.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I've had crazy days where
the worst thing ever

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.177 align:middle line:84%
happened in the morning,
and I just kept going.

00:39:43.177 --> 00:39:44.260 align:middle line:90%
It's going to turn around.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.290 align:middle line:84%
How I was going to turn
it around, I didn't know,

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:46.320 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just going
to keep asking,

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.240 align:middle line:90%
how can I turn it around?

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.090 align:middle line:90%
What do I need to do?

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:48.840 align:middle line:90%
How do I need to act?

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.090 align:middle line:90%
How do I need to move my face?

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:51.605 align:middle line:84%
How do I need to smile
in order for this thing

00:39:51.605 --> 00:39:52.760 align:middle line:90%
to be the best day ever?

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And then boom, by
nightfall, it suddenly

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:58.940 align:middle line:84%
was the best day of all time,
just that amazing ability

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.120 align:middle line:90%
to transform our day.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's all we got.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:90%
All we got is today.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.655 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any more time.

00:40:06.655 --> 00:40:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow's never
going to arrive.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Yesterday's history.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Today's the day.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to
have the best ever,

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.560 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be today.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.230 align:middle line:84%
You're an absolute
champion, David Wolfe.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Good one, my man.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, James.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:22.580 align:middle line:90%
