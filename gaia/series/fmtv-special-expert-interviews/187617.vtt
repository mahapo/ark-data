00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.358 align:middle line:84%
It's James here
for "Food Matters."

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to this FMTV special
interview with Frank Ferrante.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever wondered
why some people who seem

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to have everything
in their life--

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.420 align:middle line:84%
all the possessions, the home,
the car, the relationships--

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and yet they still seem
unhappy, depressed, anxious,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
may be suffering from adrenal
fatigue or chronic fatigue

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
syndrome, and yet
some people who

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:84%
seem to have nothing
in their life

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:90%
walk around completely happy?

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.398 align:middle line:84%
And the opposite can
be true, as well.

00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:84%
But what is it that
drives inner happiness?

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.830 align:middle line:84%
What is it that drives
this sense of inner wealth

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
that creates fulfillment
and passion in life?

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:84%
And today, my guest
to discuss this topic

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:84%
is going to be none other
than Frank Ferrante.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Frank.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Hiya, James.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing, man?

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm good.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, the other
evening over dinner

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.287 align:middle line:90%
we were having a discussion.

00:01:14.287 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about a
lot of people that you've

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:84%
met in your life,
and people who have

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.707 align:middle line:84%
gone from nothing
to huge success,

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and people that have gone
from success to nothing.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And there is something
that's inside of people

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and creates this sense of
fulfillment and inner wealth,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.475 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that's been
a big part of your journey, too.

00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:84%
When I asked you the other day,
what's the most important thing

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.502 align:middle line:84%
that you've learned
since shooting--

00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
well, being a part of the "May
I Be Frank" film and "Hungry

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.720 align:middle line:84%
for Change," you said
it was forgiveness.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:90%
So is that true?

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It is true.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.835 align:middle line:90%
I have found that--

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:90%
thank you for asking.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.418 align:middle line:84%
By the way, thank you
for having me here.

00:01:52.418 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoy your company.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy working with you
whenever I have the opportunity

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for inviting me.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:84%
At this point in my
life, it's become--

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:84%
I was lucky to discover
that reality for me.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And the misconception that
people have about forgiveness,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.090 align:middle line:90%
it's not, hey, man.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.045 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry I stepped on
your toe and whatever,

00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:13.920 align:middle line:90%
and leave it at that.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a great book called
"Radical Forgiveness."

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And just the title
alone is jarring.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And what happened to me
when I saw that title,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.920 align:middle line:84%
"Radical Forgiveness," was I was
aware of how many resentments

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:90%
I had.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.325 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought
I was cool, man.

00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:34.450 align:middle line:90%
I worked on my resentments.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you know, I've
been Freuded and Junged.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm good, you know.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that I didn't,
and that I had work to do.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's really both
inspiring and daunting

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
when you really can't escape
the consciousness of what

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.673 align:middle line:90%
you have to do.

00:02:51.673 --> 00:02:53.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't put the
toothpaste back in the tube.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to begin my
journey of genuinely forgiving.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:90%
And I had some deep resentments.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.490 align:middle line:84%
The Catholic Church was very
abusive to me as a child,

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:90%
seriously abusive.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.445 align:middle line:90%
My father was very violent.

00:03:14.445 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
What I did with those
traumas, is the lifestyle

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:84%
I chose is a result of those
traumas, compounded the trauma.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Because what traumas
do, is they get you

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:90%
to create a system of survival.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
As a child, how do
you survive this?

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
The sad part is that you take
those survival mechanisms

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and carry them into adulthood,
even though those circumstances

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:90%
no longer exist.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And you recreate them
until you learn the lesson.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And as a result
of not forgiving,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:84%
it's caused a great deal
of sorrow in my life,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:90%
and in the life of others.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.040 align:middle line:90%
And so I began.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So when I, for example,
forgave the Catholic Church,

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
it was quite an amazing
moment where I actually

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.683 align:middle line:84%
had a situation with
a monsignor, who

00:04:15.683 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
for those of you
outside the faith

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:84%
is like, middle management
in the Catholic Church.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And after a session
with this guy,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
really it felt all of a sudden
I was-- something was missing.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And normally one would
say, oh, isn't that great?

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's celebrate.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:84%
You've let go of
that resentment.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:84%
What happened was
that I felt empty

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:84%
because this resentment had
become a part of my identity.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.930 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just something
I was pissed off about.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It had become a
part of my identity.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the difficulty
with some people

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
because they have to
recreate who they are.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they showed
up in the world

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:90%
with this resentment, and I did.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:90%
So I showed up now--

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
if I were in a bar with
you, within three minutes

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I would recruit you in my
crusade against the Catholic

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Church.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:90%
But now I don't have that.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And I felt empty
and almost a grief.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And I also realized that
because of that resentment

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:90%
all the people that I had hurt.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
a one-way street.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Hurt people hurt people.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
at my side of the street

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.760 align:middle line:90%
and how I was hurting people.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
spiritual advisor

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.603 align:middle line:84%
I went to the time who told
me before this incident that--

00:05:34.603 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
because I was telling them
about all my resentments.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And then at one point after
I finished spewing out

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
all these things, he
looked at me calmly

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:90%
and said, what was your part?

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
To which I almost wanted
to throw a can at him.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Because, hey, I was a kid.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Where was my part?

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:90%
I was a victim.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:84%
I was a victim,
victim, victim, victim.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said, your part is that
you never even tried to let go.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And I felt my brain
short circuiting.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had to look at
my side of the street.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:84%
What happened was that
as I learned to forgive,

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I started the arduous
process of forgiving myself.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was a slow process,
and still continues to this day.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that, I was
ushered into the capacity

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:90%
to experience compassion.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And to me, when I feel
compassion for someone,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:90%
there is no yesterday.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.090 align:middle line:90%
There is no tomorrow.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:90%
There is no wealth.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.310 align:middle line:90%
There is no poverty.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
There is that moment,
and I'm experiencing

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
a cycle of love, which
would be great if I could

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.750 align:middle line:90%
stay in there all the time.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:90%
But I don't.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> When you began this
process of forgiveness,

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness of others,
forgiveness of self,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.935 align:middle line:84%
what is it that you discovered
inside of yourself throughout

00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:06.735 align:middle line:90%
that process?

00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of grief.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that there was
a tremendous amount of grief.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And I did everything
I could to avoid it.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I did it with drugs,
I did it with alcohol,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.518 align:middle line:90%
I did it with behavior.

00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.370 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of grief.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.057 align:middle line:84%
And part of that grief
was for the perpetrator

00:07:29.057 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:84%
because that's part of the
forgiveness, where you think,

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:90%
my God, where were they at?

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:84%
What darkness was
corroding their soul

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:84%
to that point where they could
inflict this harm on a child?

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't excuse it.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.852 align:middle line:84%
And I think forgiveness
gets a bad rap.

00:07:47.852 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
People get confused
that that means

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:90%
you don't condone the behavior.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Or as Marianne Williamson
says, just because you

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:84%
forgive somebody
doesn't mean you've

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.450 align:middle line:90%
got to take them to lunch.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:84%
But what it does, is it frees
my heart and a great deal

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:84%
of real estate in my mind, to be
able to be a better human being

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and to put some
good stuff in there.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> As you started to do that,
as you started to clear out

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:84%
your mind and fill it with more
values, belief systems, ideas--

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Love.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>> --love that supported
you, you talk about this idea

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:84%
of developing this
inner sense of wealth,

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.200 align:middle line:84%
this inner sense of contentment,
this inner sense of fulfillment

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
that seems to escape a lot of
people in this day and age.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:84%
And, by the way, for
those of you watching,

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.443 align:middle line:90%
it happens to us, too.

00:08:44.443 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:90%
It's like, we're not exempt.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And just because somebody
talks about happiness

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.100 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that
every day they wake up

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.730 align:middle line:90%
tiptoeing through the tulips.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
They have their dark
nights of the soul.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be clear that for
me, that's certainly the case.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.631 align:middle line:90%
What was the question again?

00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:06.742 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:06.742 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, what we
discussed the other night,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.100 align:middle line:84%
you said that as you clear
this space in your mind,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:84%
you start to develop a
sense of inner wealth,

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:90%
this inner fulfillment.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And you told the story about
a friend of yours that--

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I want to touch on
something that you opened with,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.060 align:middle line:90%
if I may, before I forget.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Because at this point in my,
life when I have a mental

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:84%
note it's like
carving it on ice.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:90%
I got to get to it right away.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So depression-- we
talked about depression.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Which obviously, a lot
of people suffer from

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:84%
or think they suffer from given
the pharmaceutical industry

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:90%
and how they promote it.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And you watch TV, and the
commercials are not just

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:90%
advertising antidepressants.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.132 align:middle line:84%
But they're saying, hey, if your
antidepressant doesn't work,

00:09:49.132 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:90%
you may need a little boost.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Which, I was on antidepressants.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And in retrospect, when I
was at my most depressed

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:90%
there were two things going on.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
One was I was not living
in alignment with my truth,

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.815 align:middle line:90%
with my core beliefs.

00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I was not in
alignment with them.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:84%
It means that if I am
not being true to myself,

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
if I'm saying no when I mean
yes and yes when I mean no,

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
how could I possibly
feel good about myself?

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I am going to escalate
into feeling like a fraud.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a
fraud, then I'm not

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:84%
going to trust
anybody else, either.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.380 align:middle line:84%
If I feel fraudulent,
when somebody tells me

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:47.355 align:middle line:84%
they love me I'm not going to be
able to absorb that or reflect

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to deflect it.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And you'll notice that sometimes
when people get intimate,

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:84%
when there's a conversation
that's truly reaching a heart

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:84%
space, very often what
people do is they'll

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:90%
say something that detracts.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:84%
In my case, in my journey
when a woman was kind to me,

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.122 align:middle line:84%
and I would get uncomfortable,
even though I wasn't attracted

00:11:13.122 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:84%
or it wasn't an
appropriate moment,

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I would say something
flirtatious to deflect it.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I couldn't sit with
that moment of vulnerability

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and kindness because I didn't
feel like I deserved it.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
that contributes

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:37.260 align:middle line:84%
so much to the condition that
we're in today, globally,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that we're just not
living our truth at all

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
or enough of not living our
truth to the point where

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.800 align:middle line:84%
we need to take an
antidepressant, which

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:84%
isn't to say some
people don't need it.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying don't ever take
them or anything like that.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But I would encourage
people to take a look

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.680 align:middle line:90%
at what's going on inside.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.555 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
I stopped taking them,

00:12:03.555 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:84%
because I was no
longer certain about--

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell when I was down,
if I needed to dial up my meds

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:90%
or was it causal.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I started I started to really
lose track with who I was

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:90%
and what was in here.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And as you developed
that inner strength,

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.370 align:middle line:84%
that inner happiness, that inner
wealth throughout this process,

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
throughout this work, you bring
a different Frank to the world

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:90%
now than you did 10 years ago.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And you work with people that
have everything in their life,

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.950 align:middle line:84%
everything that the
modern world aspires to.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Wealth, power, success--

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:90%
and they don't have that.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:90%
What is your advice to that?

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:58.005 align:middle line:84%
You told me a story about a lady
that was good the other day.

00:12:58.005 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>> If money were the answer,
people wouldn't be blowing

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.520 align:middle line:84%
their brains out
in Beverly Hills.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
great things I heard

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:84%
from George Harrison, who's
in the Scorsese documentary,

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.770 align:middle line:84%
he was asked-- now he's
in his mid to late 20s,

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and he was asked about his
wealth and his fame, what

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.040 align:middle line:90%
was that like.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said the greatest
thing that he learned

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:84%
about all this wealth, it takes
a lifetime for some people

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:90%
to accumulate.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:84%
He was not realizing it
takes several lifetimes.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:84%
He said that the greatest
thing that he learned

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.140 align:middle line:84%
was that it wasn't
what was going

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:84%
to bring him to happiness,
that he was grateful

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:90%
that he learned it at that age.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was
a beautiful thing

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.523 align:middle line:84%
to see in your 20s,
when you're in the midst

00:13:42.523 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:90%
of this incredible life.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Everything's an inside job.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And it speaks to, again,
feeling like you're not

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
living your truth,
no matter what

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
comes your way it's
not going to-- it's

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:90%
not going to satisfy you.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not willing
to do the inner work,

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.860 align:middle line:84%
you're going to keep
chasing these things.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Because you get a little hit.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.748 align:middle line:84%
You get a little hit when you
get a nice check in the mail,

00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:10.342 align:middle line:84%
and you get a
little hit when you

00:14:10.342 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:84%
get to sleep with that
person that you've

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:90%
been longing to sleep with.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a hedonic scale that
we talked about earlier.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.444 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:18.444 --> 00:14:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And that 1% that everybody
thinks is a separate thing,

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:90%
it's the same as anybody else.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the malignancy of more.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
If I have more,
I'll feel better.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.630 align:middle line:90%
I have more, I'll feel better.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to say that you
renounce wealth or you renounce

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.670 align:middle line:90%
abundance.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.785 align:middle line:84%
It means that it's in alignment
with your heart space.

00:14:43.785 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:50.772 align:middle line:84%
When you do receive money, is it
a righteous exchange of energy?

00:14:50.772 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what money is.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Money is not the problem.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:90%
It's like alcohol, it's neutral.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Right it's your relationship
to it that will kill you,

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:90%
if you have that--

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:84%
if you have that
negative relationship.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Heroin is neutral.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:90%
It serves a purpose.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It's an analgesic.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:90%
It serves a purpose.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's the
relationship to that,

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:90%
that causes all the problems.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's because it's not
that, it's how I relate to it.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's been an issue with us
human beings since we figured

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.665 align:middle line:90%
out how to farm, actually.

00:15:29.665 --> 00:15:33.760 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Since agriculture,
which is since-- that's

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:90%
when this whole thing started.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Hoarding.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.033 align:middle line:84%
Before that, in a
hunter gatherer society

00:15:41.033 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:90%
there was no hoarding.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Hoarding was socially
unacceptable.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Plus, you didn't have a place
to put the stuff, anyway.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So if sharing was-- and it was
a complete cycle of sharing.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:84%
People think that it was
horrible and brutal and all

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.528 align:middle line:84%
But they're doing more
research and discovering

00:15:54.528 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:90%
that it was anything but that.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And they lived a long time, and
they had a pretty good time.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.638 align:middle line:84%
Because all they
had to do, really,

00:15:59.638 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:84%
if they worked as a community,
was work for four hours.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.190 align:middle line:84%
That left a lot of
time for hanky panky.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So it was since
agriculture that we've

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:90%
been struggling with this.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So as collectively
as a race, there's

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:90%
a lesson to be learned here.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
When we learn it, then
there will be true abundance

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:90%
when everybody shares.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Because money is like--

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it described,
it's like blood.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.690 align:middle line:84%
It's got to go through the
whole body for it to work.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a part that
holds more than some other part,

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:90%
it's going to fail.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be your final
sort of rap or advice--

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> My final rap?

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> --for people?

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Before he goes.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, because you know
my dad spent a lot of his life

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
chasing the dream that
society set for him,

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:84%
that is be successful,
make a lot of money,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.758 align:middle line:90%
have a good career.

00:17:00.758 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And he did really well at that.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And then his health
failed him, and that was

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:90%
the biggest wake up for him.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to come
together as a family

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:90%
and help him get better.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And now he's developed
a sense of inner wealth

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:84%
and inner happiness
that had eluded him

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.579 align:middle line:90%
for a number of years.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about what
my dad went through,

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.890 align:middle line:84%
it was BOMAPS, Burn Out Middle
Age Professional Syndrome.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.243 align:middle line:84%
And these are people that
push really hard working

00:17:30.243 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:84%
towards somebody
else's standards,

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and they neglect their inner
health, their inner happiness.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:84%
How is it that people
can regain that sense

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.532 align:middle line:90%
of inner fulfillment?

00:17:44.532 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so grateful to be in a
forum where you're at, where

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm being asked these questions.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
It's such a
validation to my life.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.760 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.880 align:middle line:84%
What comes to mind is a book
by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.900 align:middle line:84%
"On Death and Dying," where
she interviews terminally

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
ill patients about
what they've regretted,

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:90%
and a number of other things.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Not one of them
said-- and they were

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:90%
from a cross section of life.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Very successful captains of
industry, working people--

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.250 align:middle line:84%
not one of them said, I wish
I would have worked harder.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Not one of them said, I wish I
would have invested in Pixar.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Not one of them said, I wish I
would have bought Apple stock.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
They said I wish I
would have spent more

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.950 align:middle line:90%
time with the people I loved.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:90%
All of them said that.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:53.098 align:middle line:84%
And it's so easy to get
caught up in the race.

00:18:53.098 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:90%
And there's a validity to that.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:55.800 align:middle line:84%
We have to put
food on the table.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
We have to hunt and gather,
no matter what society.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:84%
We have to feed our
children, keep the lights on.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.780 align:middle line:90%
That's all well and good.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
attitude and the heart

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.345 align:middle line:84%
that you bring into that,
that will avoid organ failure.

00:19:17.345 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I was able to go to a job I
didn't like because I knew

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:90%
that I was serving a purpose.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And the gratification of that
was that my children were

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:90%
clothed, fed, et cetera.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, I like nice things,
just like everybody else.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say,
from a Protestant scale

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:90%
they would say I'm lazy.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:90%
I love interacting with people.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And I love what's happening
when we are engaging.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And your father, who
I would love to meet,

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
has just came to that at
this point of his life.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And isn't that great
that he came to it,

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:90%
that love is everything?

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Love is everything.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.040 align:middle line:84%
This is coming
from a guy who was

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.660 align:middle line:84%
a quasi-wise guy in Brooklyn,
drug addict, alcoholic, crazy,

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Studio 54 lunatic.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And was all about
what it looked like.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And it all about how
you perceived me.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And to get from
the arc of a place

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:84%
that was riddled with
deceit and violence--

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:84%
to come out of that place and
say that love is everything,

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.400 align:middle line:90%
believe me, was quite a journey.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:90%
But I do believe that.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And what that means, is that
this doesn't make me weak.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.470 align:middle line:84%
It just helps me
reset my priorities.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, man, I got to
go to work and do

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:84%
whatever I got to do
to keep the lights on.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:90%
But what am I bringing?

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what am I
bringing to the table?

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.720 align:middle line:90%
People talk about relationships.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And these days, what can I
get out of the relationship?

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Am I getting my needs met?

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
write down my ideal--

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.390 align:middle line:90%
my lover ideal, my sexual ideal.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking that what about
what can I bring to the table.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:90%
What can I bring to the table?

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.132 align:middle line:84%
Because you know what
happens if you make a list.

00:21:14.132 --> 00:21:15.278 align:middle line:90%
You shortchange yourself.

00:21:15.278 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
has a way better plan.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So you're confining
yourself to this yellow pad

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:84%
with a few things, a column
of your requirements.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.560 align:middle line:90%
But they don't come close.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Don't underestimate
the universe, man.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.330 align:middle line:90%
And so what is it--

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:84%
if I walk out of my house
thinking, what can I bring out

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:84%
there, what can I
give today, it's

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.910 align:middle line:90%
amazing what comes back to me.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
But when I get scared,
I get constricted

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:42.870 align:middle line:90%
and I look for mine.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.810 align:middle line:84%
That's my ego telling me I
can't survive without my ego.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Hey, we don't have enough.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:90%
The 1st is coming.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.310 align:middle line:90%
The 1st of the month is coming.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I go there,
I become restricted.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:84%
If I really practice to
unfold and soften that anxiety

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and open up, I
don't worry as much.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean
that I don't put

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
one foot in front
of the-- it doesn't

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.655 align:middle line:90%
mean you don't do anything.

00:22:15.655 --> 00:22:18.007 align:middle line:84%
Because people misinterpret,
like Esther Hicks,

00:22:18.007 --> 00:22:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, if
everything is an illusion,

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.350 align:middle line:90%
why should I do anything?

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, just wake
the fuck up, will you?

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you
don't do anything.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But rather, that how
you do whatever you

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
do, what attitude
and an intention

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.200 align:middle line:90%
are you bringing to that thing?

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.015 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a saying, if
you want to grow potatoes,

00:22:41.015 --> 00:22:45.040 align:middle line:84%
you pray for rain
then you grab a plow.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And you pray that they won't
get eaten up by insects.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So you alternate your
plants so that they

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:90%
counteract each other.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:84%
But you have to make your
requests to the universe,

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
but then you've got to
get up and do something.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And when I figure it all
out, I will send "Food Matters"

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:90%
the menu.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the memo.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Shit.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Take two.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
When I figure it all out,
I'll send you the memo.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Frank.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]
