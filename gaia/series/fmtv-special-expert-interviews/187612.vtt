>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters,"

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.019 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to introduce this
special interview that I have

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.340 align:middle line:90%
with Douglas Doman.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Douglas is the son
of Glenn Doman,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and Glenn is the founder of The
Institutes for the Achievement

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.950 align:middle line:90%
of Human Potential.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.890 align:middle line:84%
This is a fantastic
organization in the US

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.780 align:middle line:84%
that helps children
in particular

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.000 align:middle line:84%
who are brain-injured
redevelop function in the body.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's breaking research
that they're doing there

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:84%
around food, nutrition,
cognitive exercises in order

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to rewire the
brain, and really acknowledges

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:84%
this idea of neuroplasticity,
that you can learn and grow

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
at any stage of life regardless
of whether you have any brain

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.682 align:middle line:84%
injury, whether it's
cerebral palsy, or autism,

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:84%
or if you're on the spectrum,
or if you have dementia

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:84%
or Alzheimer's, even
if you're older,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.850 align:middle line:84%
at any point of
your life, you have

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:84%
the capability and
the opportunity,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:84%
leveraging this concept
of neuroplasticity,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.930 align:middle line:84%
to improve cognitive function,
to improve brain function,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:84%
even if you suffer from
a bit of memory loss.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Make sure to check
this interview out.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.175 align:middle line:84%
And especially if you have
kids, this is super important.

00:01:00.984 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.575 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was two, my father
sold his house and bought

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.950 align:middle line:84%
the campus of The Institutes
for the Achievement of Human

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Potential.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:84%
His house was a small
part of a large donation

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:90%
to actually purchase the campus.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And when The
Institutes started, he

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:84%
was just working around
the clock nonstop.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And my mother was
the head nurse.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And she was working
around the clock nonstop.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:90%
So my brother and my sister--

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.617 align:middle line:84%
and this was a
surprise for them,

00:01:45.617 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
because they had been used
to having their parents

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:90%
all the time--

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:90%
I was put off with a nanny.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
But actually, to have
my own full-time adult

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:84%
to do what I wanted, and
play, and do everything

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
was just a wonderful
life for me.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And my father, to
make up for the fact

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
that he was working so
hard, permitted the children

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
to be with him whenever
he was working anywhere.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we would
sit-in with him when

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
he was seeing the parents
of brain-injured children.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And he had a very strict rule.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And the rule was, you're welcome
to sit with me in the office,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.270 align:middle line:84%
be a part of this whole process,
but if we became a distraction,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:84%
he would say, don't go
away mad, just go away.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
would go away mad.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:84%
But when he had wonderful
people coming into the home--

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:84%
medical doctors who understood
our work, scientists

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.060 align:middle line:90%
who understood our work--

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.600 align:middle line:84%
we were always
invited to be there.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we just grew up
seeing and understanding

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
what was going on
with The Institutes.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:90%
And so we lived there.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:90%
It was a part of our work.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.778 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:03:10.778 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.960 align:middle line:84%
A huge part of the problem
of what the world calls

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:84%
special needs children
is that the diagnosis

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely chaotic.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And so there are children
who have cerebral palsy.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.412 align:middle line:84%
There are children who
are called autistic.

00:03:30.412 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:84%
There are children
who are Down syndrome.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
There are children
who are epileptic.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:84%
There are children that
have learning problems.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
There are children
who are hyperactive.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And then there is the whole
host of ADHD and all the letters

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:90%
that they've created.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And The Institutes'
now in our 61st year.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:84%
We have seen these
diseases get created.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And they have just
created more chaos

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.460 align:middle line:84%
from the standpoint of parents
who, when they find out

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:84%
they have this kind
of a child, whatever

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.680 align:middle line:84%
label you want to put them in,
they're desperate to find out

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:90%
what to do.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And the problem in the world
of conventional therapy

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:84%
is each of those diseases--
cerebral palsy, autism,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
epilepsy-- they all have
their own treatments.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And all of the treatments
are based on the symptoms.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it's
well-known by science,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:84%
as it has been known for
decades or centuries,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.990 align:middle line:84%
that you cannot treat the
symptom and make the cause

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:90%
or the disease go away.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:84%
This is why physical therapy,
occupational therapy,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
speech therapy, drug
therapy, they cannot work.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:84%
They will not work because
they're attempting to treat

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:84%
the symptoms, and
it cannot be done.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So all the founding
members of The Institutes,

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
including my father, who
is a physical therapist,

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
had used conventional
therapy with all

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:84%
of their hearts
and all their might

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and found that it
wasn't effective.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And they realized
that if they were

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
going to fulfill their
goal, their objective--

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and the objective of The
Institutes from its founding

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
was for brain-injured children
to become completely well.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And the staff had
never seen or heard

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
of a brain-injured child
who had ever gotten well.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So having to treat the brain,
the problem is brain injury.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And all those children that
I just mentioned to you

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:90%
are all brain-injured.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:84%
They all have
neurological problems.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And yet parents are
distracted and think,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
oh, no, my child is
not brain-injured.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:90%
My child has cerebral palsy.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
We can even go into the
creation of those names,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:90%
because we've seen it happen.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:84%
It's been fascinating and
horrifying at the same time,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:84%
because every year now,
there continue to be

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.400 align:middle line:90%
new names and new diagnoses.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Now that the genetic tests
have proceeded and are

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
so much better now, and they're
discovering new genetic issues,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and each one gets its own name.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Smith syndrome,
or Jones syndrome.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.515 align:middle line:84%
This horrifies the
parents because there

00:06:15.515 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:84%
are only 28 kids with Smith
syndrome in the world.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:90%
This is what parents tell us.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.055 align:middle line:90%
Their child is one.

00:06:22.055 --> 00:06:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it means
if there are only 28,

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that nobody knows
anything about them.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
But we were seeing children
with Smith syndrome

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago, 40 years ago,
before the genetic issue

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:90%
was understood.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we were getting
results with them as well.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have seen
children with every kind

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:84%
of genetic issue that has
a neurological component,

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and where the actual
issue is not progressive.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a static brain
injury that has occurred.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.232 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:06:51.232 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:84%
We see the entire spectrum
of brain-injured children,

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.750 align:middle line:84%
from those children
who are mild,

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
where their only problem is
they're reading two or three

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.260 align:middle line:90%
years below age level.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And of course, these children
are considered stupid.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:10.995 align:middle line:90%
They're not stupid.

00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:84%
They have a
neurological problem.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
It can be resolved,
and they can then

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
go to the head of
their class or beyond.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:90%
They have that potential.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other
end of the spectrum,

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:84%
we see children who have been
in a coma, which is the most

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:90%
severe form of brain injury.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking what is the
bulk of how children get hurt,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:84%
yes, it's usually
through the process

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
of being born, either before
birth or during birth,

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that there is some sort of
trauma in the actual birth

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:84%
My particular area of expertise
is in terms of mobility.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And brain-injured children--
typically what the world would

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:90%
call cerebral palsy--

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:84%
these children have huge
issues in terms of mobility.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:90%
They can come to us immobile.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they're able to crawl
a little bit on their bellies,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:84%
maybe on their hands and knees
creeping, or walking and doing

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:90%
so poorly.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So with these children, there
are a whole series of programs.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the
nutritional programs

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:84%
are necessary to
give the children

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
the energy they need to get
our intensive treatment done.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's an
important component.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.045 align:middle line:84%
And of course, respiration,
particularly for chil-- well,

00:08:36.045 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:84%
we've found that virtually all
brain-injured children suffer

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:44.130 align:middle line:84%
from a chronic lack of
oxygenation of the brain,

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and oxygen being the
principal food of the brain.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
If there is that situation,
then all brain functions

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:90%
are going to suffer.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So we put a huge amount
of time and effort

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.090 align:middle line:84%
into the development of
respiratory programs, programs

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.220 align:middle line:90%
that better oxygenate the brain.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And those programs are necessary
for our physical programs,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.240 align:middle line:84%
but also for
intellectual programs,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:90%
and to promote health.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.890 align:middle line:90%
We have a health victory.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And for a brain-injured child
to have a health victory,

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
he or she has to
have had 12 months

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:90%
of consecutive perfect health.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
No influenza, no temperature, no
cold, no sniffles, no nothing.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And these are often children
who may have been hospitalized

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:84%
four or five times a year due
to their medical problems,

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.773 align:middle line:84%
and now, 12 months
perfect health.

00:09:45.773 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And these are two- or
three-year-olds in some cases.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, even average normal
two- or three-year-olds

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.270 align:middle line:84%
can't get away with
that kind of health,

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.970 align:middle line:84%
but with brain-injured
children, it can happen.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
respiratory component.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are
areas of the brain that

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.470 align:middle line:90%
are responsible for balance.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So we have programs for
balanced development.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
There are programs to
develop coordination,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
another necessary component
of mobility development.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So our objective is to get
an immobile child crawling

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.650 align:middle line:84%
on his belly following
the same normal pathway

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:90%
that the average baby follows.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.657 align:middle line:84%
All we're doing is
recreating normal development

00:10:29.657 --> 00:10:30.990 align:middle line:90%
with our brain-injured children.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.755 align:middle line:84%
So the children learn to
crawl on their bellies

00:10:33.755 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
to the point
they're crawling all

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:84%
over the house as a
means of transportation.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Then we give them a
balanced development program

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:84%
so they can push up onto
the third dimension,

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:84%
begin to creep on
their hands and knees.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:84%
They do hundreds of
meters of that a day.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the process
of learning how to walk

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and becoming
independent walkers,

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and we have a series of programs
for independent walking.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, running,
hopping, skipping, and jumping,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.625 align:middle line:84%
and then on to gymnastics,
biking, swimming.

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
we're moving them

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:84%
into physical excellence,
which is our objective

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:90%
for every brain-injured child.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Not to be just average, but
to be physically excellent.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.808 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:11:17.808 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, brain-injured children,
as a symptom of their brain

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
injury, are much more
sensitive to certain foods

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:90%
than average people.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So their ability to have
issues in terms of allergy

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:84%
is enormous compared to
the average population.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So our program, of
course, is dairy-free.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.450 align:middle line:90%
It's gluten-free.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:84%
There are a whole series
of different foods

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.850 align:middle line:90%
that are eliminated.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, with a
rotational diet,

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:84%
once the child is desensitized
to that particular kind

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:84%
of food, like
citrus, then we will

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
begin to rotate in citrus
maybe one or two days

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.180 align:middle line:84%
a week so that they can
have that in their diet,

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:84%
but not keep having
it day in and day out.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And with brain-injured
children, it

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.530 align:middle line:84%
becomes more
difficult and complex,

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.060 align:middle line:84%
particularly the children
that the world calls autistic.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, we disagree
with all of these terms,

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and children who
are autistic are

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.160 align:middle line:84%
injured in the posterior areas
of the midbrain and the cortex.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And these children often
have very limited diets

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.340 align:middle line:84%
that they have created
for themselves.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.520 align:middle line:84%
They simply won't
eat other foods,

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:84%
making it difficult
for their parents.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So we have to move beyond
that, because having

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.050 align:middle line:84%
the same foods
all the time, they

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.690 align:middle line:84%
become very sensitive
to those foods,

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and then we need to give them
a much broader range of foods

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:90%
that they can eat.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, once the parents
have worked this out and we

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:02.260 align:middle line:84%
have a diet that is tailor-made
for each child in terms of his

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:90%
food, his vitamin supplements--

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:84%
this is all done with
the medical staff.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And the work is very advanced
in that all of the children

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
receive very
sophisticated blood tests.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And looking at
these blood tests--

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and we have our own database
where the information about

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:90%
each child is put in--

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.900 align:middle line:84%
that information
then can determine

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:84%
how we can tailor-make
that nutritional program

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that all
the elements in the blood

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:84%
are at optimum levels
that they should be,

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:84%
or that the things
that shouldn't be there

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:90%
should be at minimum levels.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
We've now expanded this into a
nutrigenetic test with research

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.330 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing with
Penn State University.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So now, Penn State has made
available very expensive tests

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
for our children at
a very minimal price.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And so now, our
medical staff can

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:84%
look at the genetic
situation of the child,

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.940 align:middle line:84%
look at it together with the
child's digestive situation,

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and then tailor-make
that nutritional program

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:90%
even with the genes in mind.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is really
pioneering work.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's ironic that
our relationship

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:84%
began with our mutual friendship
with Novak and Jelena Djokovic,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:90%
because here he is.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:84%
He is also having
his blood looked at

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:84%
in order to help him to
create the ideal diet so he

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:90%
can compete at optimum levels.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't talked to him,
but I wouldn't be surprised

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:84%
if he's also doing that from
a genetic standpoint as well.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So here we see top
flight athletes basically

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:84%
having the same kind
of nutritional program

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:84%
that brain-injured
children need in order

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
to have the best
chance of getting well.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.404 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:02.404 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, in The
Institute's history,

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.940 align:middle line:84%
this goes back to
the early 1960s,

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:84%
when my father
wrote the book "How

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:90%
to Teach Your Baby to Read."

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So in the early 1960s, for
those children in particular

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:84%
who were called cervical
palsy, who are often considered

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
because of the way they
look to be unintelligent,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:84%
when in fact, like all
brain-injured children,

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:84%
they have incredible
potential from

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.390 align:middle line:90%
an intellectual standpoint.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So my father taught
their parents--

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and my mother also, an
Institute staff member--

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:84%
how to teach their
children to read.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So by the early
1960s, we had hundreds

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:84%
of severely
brain-injured children

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
who were three years
of age who were reading

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.080 align:middle line:84%
like eight- or nine-year-old
average children way

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:90%
above age level.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So he wrote the book "How
to Teach Your Baby to Read"

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:84%
so that we could
share this program

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:84%
with the parents of
well babies, and that

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:84%
began what we call
the gentle revolution.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And the gentle revolution
is the gentle revolution

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:84%
of well babies having
the opportunity

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:84%
to achieve physical,
intellectual, social,

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.780 align:middle line:90%
and physiological excellence.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there is two aspects
of our work, one totally

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.860 align:middle line:84%
related to the special
needs children,

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and then the other
for well babies.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Because basically,
from birth to age six,

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.520 align:middle line:84%
it is during these six
years that the brain

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.690 align:middle line:84%
grows explosively, when the
child has by far the best

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:84%
ability to take in
huge amounts of data

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:90%
without any effort whatsoever.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And these years are being
wasted because children

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:84%
don't go to school
until age six,

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:84%
when basically, brain growth and
development at that explosive

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.089 align:middle line:90%
time has stopped.

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So our program is
basically birth to age six.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.224 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:17:11.224 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:84%
And we have heard this kind of
question over and over again.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
have not read the books

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.342 align:middle line:84%
in the "Gentle
Revolution" series--

00:17:25.342 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
"How to Teach Your
Baby Math," "How

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
to Multiply Your
Baby's Intelligence,"

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:84%
our physical book, "Fit
Baby, Smart Baby, Your Baby,"

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.910 align:middle line:84%
"How to Teach Your Baby to
Swim," all of these books

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:84%
say that it's
absolutely necessary

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:90%
that the child is never pushed.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:84%
If the child is being
pushed, the parents

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:90%
are making a mistake.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you push the
child, the chances

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:84%
are good that the child
is going to hate whatever

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.940 align:middle line:90%
it is you're trying to push.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.865 align:middle line:84%
I had years of that
in private school.

00:17:57.865 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] And some
of us have experienced

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
that in all of our own
educational experience.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:90%
So there can be no pushing.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we're
talking about birth

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:90%
to six years of age.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So it has to be totally fun
from the child's standpoint.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the child
simply won't engage.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And there is now the
science to indicate

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that if we human beings, adults,
and children, that if we are

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
relaxed, and we are happy,
and we don't feel threatened,

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and we believe that
this is a joyful thing,

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:90%
we will learn much more easily.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically a
hallmark of our program.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
something like reading,

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:52.000 align:middle line:84%
reading is considered a subject
in school, like geography,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:90%
or mathematics.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Reading is not a subject.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.370 align:middle line:90%
It is a neurological function.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:84%
It is a function of the
brain, and a unique one,

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and one of the highest functions
that we human beings have.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
So our program is about
giving the children a joy

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:16.360 align:middle line:84%
of learning-- our hurt kids
as well as our well kids--

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and then making sure that
throughout their lives,

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:84%
they never lose that
childlike love of learning

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:24.940 align:middle line:90%
that they have.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So anything that gets in the way
of that happening is verboten.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And in our early
development program--

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.490 align:middle line:90%
which is from birth to five--

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
and then our
international school,

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.930 align:middle line:84%
which is our demonstration
school in Philadelphia, which

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
goes from five to
age 14, the children

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:84%
are always encouraged
to be self-determined

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:90%
in terms of their education.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:84%
I had the pleasure for 20 years
to teach the children history,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:84%
a usual pretty dry subject
that a lot of people

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.110 align:middle line:84%
hate to have to go
through in school.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So in my history course,
the children were asked,

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:90%
what would you like to choose?

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
What would you like to
read about in history?

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they came up with all
kinds of incredible things

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:90%
that blew my mind.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:84%
A 12-year-old girl studying
whether Queen Elizabeth I

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.313 align:middle line:90%
was a virgin or not.

00:20:25.313 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] And here, they go
into the research into that,

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and I'm reading
it along with them

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.420 align:middle line:90%
and enjoying it as their joy.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And then in the end, it's
up to them as a historian,

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
because what the
purpose of my course

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.650 align:middle line:84%
was not to study history, but to
be a historian, in the same way

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:84%
that our children
don't study violin.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
The purpose is for
them to be a violinist.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Or to be a swimmer, or
a runner, or a gymnast,

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
or a biker, whatever
the children

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.585 align:middle line:84%
wish to do from a
physical standpoint.

00:20:58.585 --> 00:21:01.195 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:21:01.195 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's well
beyond a philosophy.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It's an established
scientific fact.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
We have been
teaching the parents

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:84%
of brain-injured
children and well babies

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:84%
for more than 50 years that
the brain grows by use.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And our parents can tell
you that from as much as 50

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the last 10
years, in the world

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.960 align:middle line:84%
of neuroscience, the big
exciting thing that's

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
happening in neuroscience
and all the research that

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:84%
proves this, the big
word is neuroplasticity.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Neuroplasticity.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, may I please translate?

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity means
the brain grows by use.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, in all the research and
things that you read about it--

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and now there are
plenty of research

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:84%
to indicate that children
have a wonderful capacity

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:90%
in this regard.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:90%
But often, it ends up--

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.520 align:middle line:84%
well, now that we
know this, we need

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:84%
to learn how we can actually
use that neuroplasticity.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've been
doing it for 50 years.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:84%
We've been teaching the parents
of brain-injured children

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:84%
to use that neuroplasticity
to teach them

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:84%
how to walk, talk, hop, skip,
and jump, read, and write.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing in
terms of well babies.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Our parents are
actually doing it.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:90%
They're making it happen.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, an even newer word--

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:84%
also exciting in
neuroscience-- is neurogenesis.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And this has a long
and sad history,

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:53.880 align:middle line:84%
because if you go back to the
great universities like Harvard

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and Yale, we have generations
of medical doctors

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.130 align:middle line:84%
that were taught that when a
brain cell is dead, it is dead.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.080 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
you can do about it.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And this, of course, has
laid the foundation why

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:84%
brain-injured children
cannot succeed.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Why they cannot be made well is
because medical doctors believe

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:84%
well, they don't understand
about neuroplasticity.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
about neurogenesis.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:90%
And you read the medical texts.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.360 align:middle line:84%
When a brain cell
is dead, it is dead.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can be done.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, now it has been
proven by neurophysiologists

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:39.340 align:middle line:84%
that neurogenesis
occurs in human beings.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So in children, in you and I,
in 80-year-olds, new brain cells

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.590 align:middle line:90%
are popping into place.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, those brain cells will
die unless we use them.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:90%
The brain grows by use.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
neurophysiologists

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.980 align:middle line:84%
that have come and lectured
to us at the institutes

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.500 align:middle line:84%
have said that now, the
most important things that

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.290 align:middle line:84%
have been learned about
keeping those cells alive

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and making them go to
work is number one,

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:84%
they have to be
well-fed, meaning

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:90%
they need to be oxygenated.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So our physical program,
our aerobic program,

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.920 align:middle line:84%
our oxygen enrichment
programs are

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.990 align:middle line:90%
essential to make that happen.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.200 align:middle line:84%
There is a mobility
component to it.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.850 align:middle line:90%
You need to be mobile.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's what we do.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:84%
We get our children crawling,
creeping, walking, running,

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:90%
and jumping.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
challenge the brain

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:90%
to be doing something new.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, for a child who
crawls on his belly,

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
the new thing is he's got
to get up on his hands

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.180 align:middle line:90%
and knees and creep.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:84%
For the child who walks, now
he needs to learn to run.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
challenge the brain.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So for you and I
to use those cells,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:84%
we need to learn
Chinese, or learn

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:57.480 align:middle line:84%
to play the piano, or
some new challenging act.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have neuroplasticity,
the brain grows by use,

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:90%
and neurogenesis.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason
our program works

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.865 align:middle line:84%
is not based solely
on neurogenesis,

00:25:07.865 --> 00:25:09.240 align:middle line:84%
but there are many
things that go

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:84%
on in terms of brain growth and
development beyond just that.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, in that world of cerebral
palsy, which of course,

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:84%
for those of us
who are responsible

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:84%
for mobility development,
these children

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:84%
can be among the
most challenging.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.400 align:middle line:84%
A young Italian
boy who came to us

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
immobile, both parents
medical doctors,

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:90%
and very tight, rigid body.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this is circa
The Institute's program

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:51.300 align:middle line:84%
30 years ago, which is
not in the same league

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
with The Institute's
program today

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.500 align:middle line:84%
because it's constantly
evolving as we

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:90%
develop new and better methods.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So this family,
whereas a baby learns

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to crawl in a matter of
months, years before he

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.810 align:middle line:90%
was able to crawl.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And a baby in
seven months of age

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:84%
is creeping on his hands
and knees, years for him

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.510 align:middle line:84%
to creep on his hands
and knees, and then years

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.730 align:middle line:90%
learning how to walk.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:22.890 align:middle line:90%
And [ITALIAN] then ended up--

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:84%
he had never gone to
school a day in his life.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:84%
His parents had coached him all
the way through this process.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And when he went to take
the examinations to go

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to university in
Italy, he scored

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:42.300 align:middle line:84%
in the top 99% of
all Italian children,

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:84%
then went to university, and
is now an assistant professor

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.500 align:middle line:90%
of mathematics.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:84%
So he wrote an article which
he sent to one of our staff

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:59.860 align:middle line:84%
who has a Harvard PhD in
mathematics, and he's our dean.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And this article written by our
brain-injured child, the math

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:10.650 align:middle line:84%
professor, our math professor
said it was way above his head.

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.840 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.060 align:middle line:90%
So there is an example.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Also in Italy, I'm the president
of our institutes in Europe,

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.710 align:middle line:84%
so a lot of my time
has been spent there.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:30.450 align:middle line:84%
But a Down syndrome child,
Francesco Aleo, and his parents

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:90%
came, again, 30 years ago.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:90%
And he was one.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.800 align:middle line:90%
They did a wonderful program.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.790 align:middle line:84%
By the time he was five, they
said he was ready to graduate.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:43.590 align:middle line:90%
We said, no.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:49.290 align:middle line:84%
We're more conservative
than our parents sometimes.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So he never graduated
from our program,

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:84%
but he went on to
elementary school.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.300 align:middle line:84%
He went on to middle
school, high school,

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:84%
went on to university, and
then got his master's degree

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.310 align:middle line:90%
in economics.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And we had never heard of a
Down syndrome person reaching

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:84%
such a high level academically,
particularly economics,

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:19.480 align:middle line:84%
until one of our girls in
Brazil got her master's degree.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So Francesco, his
parents wrote a book

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:26.160 align:middle line:84%
about the process of doing
the program with him.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And he's a wonderful,
wonderful young man.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.968 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:28:31.968 --> 00:28:35.250 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 50 years, we have
seen hundreds if not thousands

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:90%
of these children.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And they are evaluated
neurologically

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.620 align:middle line:84%
just like all the
children that we see.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And when we see them young, one
year of age, two years of age,

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:55.600 align:middle line:84%
we find them to have an
injury in the midbrain.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And the midbrain has
large responsibilities

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:84%
in terms of mobility, language,
and manual competence.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And so from the
world's standpoint,

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.740 align:middle line:84%
language, manual competence are
particular areas of difficulty

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.870 align:middle line:90%
with Down syndrome children.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we get into the
horrendous history of the names

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.410 align:middle line:90%
that children have been given.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, I'm sure,
if you go back 75 years ago,

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.240 align:middle line:90%
these children--

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:30.190 align:middle line:84%
the medical diagnosis, the
standard medical diagnosis

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.270 align:middle line:84%
is that these children
were Mongoloid idiots.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of the
horrendous history of the names

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
that are put on
brain-injured children.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
that same time,

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.510 align:middle line:84%
there were three standard
diagnoses for brain-injured

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:47.620 align:middle line:90%
children--

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.650 align:middle line:90%
idiot, imbecile, and moron.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So parents were told,
your child is an idiot.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, parents knew
that their child

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:02.290 align:middle line:84%
wasn't an idiot in their hearts,
and so they objected to that.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And it took a long time for
the professionals to catch on.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can't be
calling children idiots,

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:13.450 align:middle line:84%
or imbeciles, or
morons, so let's call

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:90%
them mentally retarded.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So the name mentally
retarded, 60 or so years ago,

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.540 align:middle line:90%
replaced those other names.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
an offensive term.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:84%
We've been fighting a battle
against that for years.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Now it's considered
politically incorrect.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But it was scientifically
correct, 60 years ago,

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:84%
when the name was foolishly
made in the first place.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So these children,
like all babies,

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:49.250 align:middle line:84%
have incredible potential
from a physical, intellectual,

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.870 align:middle line:90%
and social standpoint.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And when we get them
young, we can prevent them

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.830 align:middle line:90%
from having a cortical injury.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, the cortex is the
highest level of the brain.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:03.730 align:middle line:84%
It's responsible for human
intelligence, the ability

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:08.740 align:middle line:84%
to read, to understand language,
and of course, to speak,

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.230 align:middle line:90%
and to be able to write as well.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:18.670 align:middle line:84%
When we get children when they
are 6, 8, 10 years of age,

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:84%
they will often have
a cortical injury.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is they
haven't been taught properly.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And their abilities and their
potential intellectually

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.440 align:middle line:84%
has been ignored,
so they have been

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.340 align:middle line:84%
considered not
capable of learning,

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.850 align:middle line:90%
so not taught properly.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And then they begin to
fall behind their peers,

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and then we see that
cortical injury.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have had
hundreds of children

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.570 align:middle line:84%
where we've resolved their
cortical problems even

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:52.750 align:middle line:90%
at 9, 10, 12, 15 years of age.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:84%
But it requires more work
to be able to do that.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.740 align:middle line:84%
When we get the children
young as babies,

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.670 align:middle line:84%
we simply prevent the cortical
problem from ever happening.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:05.650 align:middle line:84%
I just came back from
our institutes in Europe,

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and a four-year-old
Down syndrome girl

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.670 align:middle line:84%
who had started the
program as a baby

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:84%
was reading like
an eight-year-old,

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:17.230 align:middle line:90%
running a mile non-stop.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Average children cannot
run a mile non-stop.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.120 align:middle line:84%
She was starting
to brachiate, which

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.510 align:middle line:84%
is going hand over hand an
overhead ladder with your feet

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.310 align:middle line:90%
off the ground.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And she was speaking two
languages with good quality.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And she was absolutely
charming too,

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.950 align:middle line:90%
and incredibly well-behaved.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is the kind of potential
that these children have.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.698 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:32:44.698 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:84%
The dream would be
to get rid of all

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.180 align:middle line:84%
of those names that are
used, because they're

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.280 align:middle line:90%
a distraction for parents.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.340 align:middle line:84%
It creates chaos and
smoke for parents.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not bad enough,
professionals as well,

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.030 align:middle line:84%
because they believe the
cerebral palsy, autistic, et

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:06.830 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So to get rid of
all of those names,

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.410 align:middle line:84%
understand that these
children and adults are all

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.270 align:middle line:84%
brain-injured, and that it's
not the end of the world being

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.070 align:middle line:90%
brain-injured.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:20.220 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter is we're
all brain-injured in some way.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, even if we
go to the genetic issues--

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I know nothing about
genetics, but I

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:31.550 align:middle line:84%
would be prepared
to make a guess

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:35.810 align:middle line:84%
that as the genetic tests get
better and better, that five

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.710 align:middle line:84%
years from now, maybe
10 years from now,

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
it'll be found that
all of us are not

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:84%
perfect from a
genetic standpoint.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.807 align:middle line:90%


00:33:46.807 --> 00:33:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing,
of course, would

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:51.690 align:middle line:84%
be to have all of the
treatment relating

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.840 align:middle line:84%
to brain-injured children
to be based on brain growth

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and development, and
no treatment related

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.050 align:middle line:90%
to the symptoms whatsoever.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:03.450 align:middle line:84%
In the world of well
babies, it would

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:06.570 align:middle line:84%
be that their
potential is respected,

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and that love of learning
is never squashed,

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and that they can be
taught early in life when

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.409 align:middle line:90%
it's easy for them to learn.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:17.969 align:middle line:84%
And I will leave
this to another time,

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:23.310 align:middle line:84%
but I know you feel
passionately about learning

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.310 align:middle line:90%
foreign languages.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:25.500 align:middle line:90%
We do too.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.409 align:middle line:84%
And kids have an
incredible capacity

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.510 align:middle line:90%
to learn foreign languages.

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And imagine each culture
that opens up to them

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.199 align:middle line:90%
as they're able to do that.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I have been the president of The
Institutes in Italy for years,
