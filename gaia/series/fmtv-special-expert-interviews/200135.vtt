00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.530 align:middle line:84%
It's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to this FMTV special
on conquering self sabotage

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and mastering limiting
beliefs in order

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to help you achieve
the health and life that you

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:90%
truly deserve.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.400 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is
Melissa Ambrosini,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle line:84%
author of this awesome new book,
"Mastering Your Mean Girl."

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to be sharing
with you some awesome success

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.490 align:middle line:84%
stories, some personal
stories from fear into love,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and some great tips on how
to help transform your life.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Mel, how you doing?

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:90%
So excited to be here.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Likewise.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.647 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, your story is one
that's super interesting.

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm lucky to have known
you for a little while now

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.808 align:middle line:84%
and heard little
bits along the way.

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But tell me a little
bit how it was for you

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, your
first career moves,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:84%
what you were doing for
work, and how that urged you

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:90%
into this new field.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, before I
do what I do now,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I was an actor and a
professional dancer.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I danced at the
Moulin Rouge in Paris.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And I did a bit
of TV presenting.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But all of my measure
of happiness and success

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
was on external things, so on
the job, on what I looked like,

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:90%
the money, the boyfriends.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was incredibly
unfulfilled.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I was unwell and unhappy
and spiraling downwards.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I was dealing with an
eating disorder, depression,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety, and panic attacks.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And I would just pop another
pill and march on forward.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And it got to a point
where my body shut down

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up in hospital with
a whole host of health issues

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.980 align:middle line:84%
from chronic fatigue,
thyroid problems,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:84%
so many different little
things, hormone imbalances,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.025 align:middle line:84%
high levels of mercury, CBO,
candida, like everything.

00:01:55.025 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of
autoimmune condition.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
it was starting

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.010 align:middle line:90%
to manifest in my skin.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:90%
So I had hives all over my body.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.790 align:middle line:90%
I had eczema all over my face.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:90%
And I had acne.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And what really pushed
me over the edge was

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.110 align:middle line:90%
I contacted the cold sore virus.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'd never had a cold sore
before in my entire life.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And I got them all over my face,
like even up under my eyes,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.470 align:middle line:90%
in my mouth, and down my throat.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And that was just
a representation

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:90%
of what was going on inside me.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>> My immune system was so
low that that's what was

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:90%
the manifestation of that.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And leading up until that
moment I'd landed in hospital,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I had had all of these little
nudges from the universe

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:84%
to kind of stop and slow
down and look after myself,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.760 align:middle line:90%
but I ignored them.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:90%
So the universe is like, right?

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
put you in hospital

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and make you stop
and make you look.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I ended up in
hospital, this is back in 2010,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and it was the darkest
and hardest point

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:90%
in my entire life.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I was,
at the time, I was

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.110 align:middle line:90%
living on my friend's couch.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:90%
I had no money.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I was sleeping on her couch.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what I
wanted to do with my life.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:90%
I was single.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was very unhappy.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was on anti-depressants
and very, very unwell.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And even though that
was the darkest point

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
in my entire life, there was
this tiny, tiny, tiny glimmer

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:90%
of hope.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like I
could finally surrender.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And this little bit
of hope Inside me

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.692 align:middle line:84%
said, if you sort
yourself out, if you

00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:84%
sort your health
and your life out,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:90%
you will live an awesome life.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.765 align:middle line:84%
And my mean girl, which is
that voice inside your head,

00:03:44.765 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:90%
was like, yeah right.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:90%
That won't happen to you.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't happen
to people like you.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:84%
But that was the first time
I followed my intuition.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And at the time,
one of my friends

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
sent me a parcel when
I was in hospital.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And in that parcel
was Louise Hay's, "You

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:90%
Can Heal Your Life."

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was the door
that was opened to me to this

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
personal development,
spirituality,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:90%
holistic health world.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And I read this book just
like light bulbs going off,

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:84%
light bulb, light
bulb, light bulb.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh my
god, there is another way.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.620 align:middle line:84%
The way I had been
taught and the way

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I'd been living my life with
fear as my driving force,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.820 align:middle line:84%
there was another way that
was being exposed to me.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And from there, it
was so exciting.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I dove headfirst
into this world,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and I read every book I could
get my hands on from Deepak

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Chopra, Marianne Williamson,
Eckhart Tolle, Bruce

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Lipton, Demartini.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And I just became
obsessed with this world.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I studied holistic
health coaching.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:84%
I studied life coaching,
yoga teacher training,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:90%
AcuEnergetics, meditation.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And I just fully immersed
myself in this holistic wellness

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I did that was
because I started to feel good.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And I started to come off
all of these medications.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in
hospital, the doctors

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
plunked this tray full of
drugs in front of me and said,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.640 align:middle line:84%
you have to take these
antidepressants, antivirals,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:90%
antibacterials, anti whatever.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
these indefinitely.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, that's
not good enough for me.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew that there
was going to be another way.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know logically
what that was.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But that tiny bit of
hope was just like, no.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:90%
There's got to be another way.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And I dove completely
headfirst into this world,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:84%
like I said, because I
started to feel good.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:90%
And then this was six years ago.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And from there,
I started working

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:84%
one-on-one with women helping
them with their health and life

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.120 align:middle line:90%
goals.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And I started coaching
them one-on-one.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:90%
I started writing e-books.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The first e-book I ever wrote
was "12 Steps to Wellness."

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and I just started
sharing on my blog.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I started being asked to
speak at different things.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And it has just
snowballed to where

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
it is today and having
this beautiful book,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.930 align:middle line:84%
"Mastering Your Mean
Girl," being now birthed

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It's such a beautiful book.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so
many great photos

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.800 align:middle line:90%
in here and practical tips.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first parts
that you talk about in the book

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and really about
this whole story

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.490 align:middle line:84%
is moving from this
approach toward yourself

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and towards life in
general of fear into love.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about
this a little earlier

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:90%
before the interview.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that has permeated

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.680 align:middle line:84%
so many different elements
of our lives and society

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a bit about this concept
and how people can practically

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.210 align:middle line:90%
make that transition.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, fear is hardwired
into modern society.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.640 align:middle line:84%
It is shoved down our throats
from a very young age.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And most of us,
like me, I didn't

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.890 align:middle line:90%
know there was another way.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I thought fear was the
way to live your life.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I
ended up in hospital

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and I was exposed Louise
Hay's work, I was like,

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, there is
another way to live.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to live
a fear-driven life.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't realize that.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't realize that.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it takes a
health crisis or a death.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>> A wakeup call.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>> A wake up call
for us to realize,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't have
to be that way.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.860 align:middle line:84%
This could be your wake
up call, this interview.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Or you could have that
realization on your yoga mat.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be something
so dramatic like what I had

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:84%
or like what your
dad went through.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So for me, this
revolutionized the way

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I thought, the way I lived,
the way I did everything

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:84%
because I realized that
every area of my life,

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:90%
I was doing out of fear.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.610 align:middle line:84%
So the work I was doing
was from a place of fear.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:84%
The relationships
were from fear.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I was scared to be alone, so I
held on to these relationships.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> How did that work
with the profession,

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:90%
the work you were doing?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this, for me, being
an actress and being a dancer,

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:90%
that was once my truth.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, it
was no longer my truth,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
but I kept on trying to shove
this square peg into a round

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:84%
hole and convince
myself that it was.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.857 align:middle line:84%
I'd been doing this
since I was three.

00:08:31.857 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:90%
I've got to love it.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I've spent so much
money doing this.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.159 align:middle line:84%
But it was no longer
lighting me up,

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and I was just trying to
convince myself otherwise.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of people go
to different jobs and careers

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.055 align:middle line:90%
from a place of fear.

00:08:46.055 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know that
you could do something

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:90%
that you loved every day.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know that.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It's funny that, I guess, you
and I have individually found

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:84%
something we're so passionate
about in our lives.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Me with "Food Matters" and
FMTV and you with the work

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:90%
that you do.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And that has become
a reality for us.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:84%
But had you asked
us both 10 years ago

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:84%
that doing something that you're
completely passionate about

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and that you love is
something that you

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
can do for the
rest of your life,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have imagined
it possible either.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>> No way.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:90%
And earn a living doing it.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:90%
And that isn't taught to us.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:84%
That's not taught
to us in school.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And it is, it can
be your reality.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the career,
the relationships,

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
the way I was eating and
not eating was from fear.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.423 align:middle line:84%
It was, oh, I better
not eat that because I

00:09:38.423 --> 00:09:39.590 align:middle line:90%
don't want to put on weight.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.447 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe I should limit that.

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:90%
And it was all fear based.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
The way I moved my body,
the way I exercised was I've

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:84%
got to flog my body at the
gym out of fear of what I ate

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:90%
the night before or look like.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:84%
It was never living
from a place of love

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.760 align:middle line:84%
was not something that
I was taught in school,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:90%
and I wish it was.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:90%
But I learned.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's the main thing.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> What advice do you give
to people to transform that

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:90%
philosophy from fear to love?

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So on all of those
areas you just

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.600 align:middle line:84%
talked about with
your profession,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:84%
with your relationships, with
your body and exercise, I mean,

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.140 align:middle line:84%
how do we transform
that from fear to love?

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess the first
thing is awareness,

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:84%
is becoming crystal clear of
what areas in your life that

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:84%
you are currently
doing it out of fear.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some
relationships.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe there's
the food aspect.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're so focused on that
that you're just so petrified

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
of everything that
you put in your mouth

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:90%
or don't put in your mouth.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:90%
So awareness is key.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
are aware, you've

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
shone light on something,
and it's no longer dark.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of times, even
the awareness is the cure.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Because becoming aware
of it, you're like, oh,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:90%
why was I doing that?

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:90%
That's so silly.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:90%
And then that fixes it itself.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But then you can go another
step further, right,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:90%
by transforming it with love.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Transforming it with love.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very, very
simple three-step process.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about this little
three-step process in my book.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.138 align:middle line:84%
So the first step
is the awareness.

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:13.680 align:middle line:84%
So once you are
aware-- and you know,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:84%
if you want to write these
down and tell your partner,

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:84%
he can help hold you
accountable or she

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.880 align:middle line:90%
can help hold you accountable.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
But once you are aware, write
these are the areas in my life

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.400 align:middle line:84%
that I'm currently
living out of fear.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:84%
We then have the
second choice is

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
closing the door
on those thoughts,

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.930 align:middle line:84%
closing the door on them,
and then choosing love

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:90%
instead, and transforming that.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it's I eat
out of fear of what

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I look like,
transforming it to I

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.430 align:middle line:84%
choose to eat this beautiful
food because I love my body so

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:84%
much and I want to nourish
and thrive and feel energetic.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's just about
changing the dialogue.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Changing the dialogue,
the narrative, the language.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>> To yourself mainly,
isn't it really?

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:90%
To yourself.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And then once you've got that
little three-step process,

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.858 align:middle line:84%
it's you're the one that's got
to hold yourself accountable.

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:90%
No one can do it for you.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Jimmy can't do it for you.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it for you.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Your mom can't do it for you.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to hold
yourself accountable.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's really empowering.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But it requires us to take
self-responsibility, which

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.560 align:middle line:90%
most of us don't want to do.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
But we have to take back
that power within ourselves.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.350 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to
eat well for us.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.510 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to
meditate for us

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.520 align:middle line:84%
or practice self-love
rituals for us.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
We've got to take
that responsibility.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, you
just feel so much better.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:84%
We all know what it feels like
when we're trashing our body

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and when we're not looking after
ourselves and loving ourselves.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
We know, we feel,
life becomes hard.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you're working against
the natural processes of life,

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:90%
then it is a struggle.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's coming
up in this conversation here

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:84%
is that maybe love was the
way we were meant to live.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we were always meant
to have a loving relationship

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle line:84%
with food, a loving
relationship with ourselves,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:84%
a loving relationship
with our, obviously,

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.270 align:middle line:90%
our spouse and our family.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And yet, what do you think
it is that has shifted us

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.980 align:middle line:84%
from a love truth really
to a fear based society?

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seems that
everything is fear based,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
the advertising around 401(k)s
or superannuation or finance

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:90%
or your job.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Or if you don't
have perfect teeth,

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.070 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to have
the perfect life partner.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Or if you smell bad,
you're not going

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to meet the woman
of your dreams.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's we're bombarded
with this fear based approach.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.082 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think we have
this now in society?

00:13:42.082 --> 00:13:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's a bit of a
philosophical question.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.498 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
an important thing

00:13:45.498 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
to tackle because a lot
of people might be saying,

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:48.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:84%
How did I get conditioned
with this fear?

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I love what you said
because you're so right.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:90%
It is our natural state.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Love is our natural state.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is we're
born into this world

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:84%
as beautiful, whole, little,
perfect, little beings.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And as you know looking
at Hugo, they're

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
just so beautiful and
bursting with love.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is these
experiences through life.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
By the age of three, we've
been told the word no thousands

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.590 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of times.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And then our parents
get divorced.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And we blame ourselves.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Someone calls us stupid,
and we then believe that.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Someone calls us fat and ugly.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:90%
We then believe we're unlovable.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.463 align:middle line:90%
We have our first heartbreak.

00:14:31.463 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:84%
We then believe
we're undesirable.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:90%
We get fired.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
We then believe
we're unemployable.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:90%
We accumulate debt.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:90%
We then believe we're worthless.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is along our
journey, these things that help

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.140 align:middle line:90%
us grow, we take them on board.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And we let them
shape our identity.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I always say,
it's like each story is a brick.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And we put that brick in
our spiritual backpack,

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and we carry that
spiritual backpack

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
full of heavy old stories
and bricks through life.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.628 align:middle line:84%
And then some people get to
where they have a wake up call,

00:15:10.628 --> 00:15:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and they realize
that they don't have

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.518 align:middle line:84%
to carry that heavy backpack
full of bricks anymore.

00:15:14.518 --> 00:15:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they just
drop the backpack.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.518 align:middle line:84%
>> And they just
drop the backpack.

00:15:17.518 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, oh my god.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>> So much better.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So much better.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I've been carrying that baggage
sometimes 50, 60, 70, 80 years.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful that I
had my realization at 24.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I was quite young and
had this wake up call.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful
for that because I

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.460 align:middle line:84%
got to dump my
backpack quite early.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have
to be like that.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to carry
these stories around.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And everyone knows
what those stories are.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you shine awareness on
those things, those areas where

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
you're doing things
out of fear, there's

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.965 align:middle line:84%
usually a story
attached to that.

00:15:59.965 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Super interesting.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:90%
I love that metaphor.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I think it's so powerful
the analogy of the backpack.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've gotten so much value
and I think such a reverence

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.727 align:middle line:84%
for the research and the studies
around limiting belief systems.

00:16:14.727 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think what you're
touching on here is really that.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the stories and
the limiting beliefs

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that we build up about
ourselves and how

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.680 align:middle line:90%
that influences our lives.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is sort of
moving from the fear

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.180 align:middle line:84%
into love now into
more limiting beliefs.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's the work of Bruce
Lipton and Tony Robbins.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And so many people have
brought this to light.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
such a powerful idea

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that the only reason we do not
really have the life that we

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.712 align:middle line:84%
truly love or would
desire is because of all

00:16:47.712 --> 00:16:48.920 align:middle line:90%
those bricks in the backpack.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can't-- like you if
you want the dream career

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and whatever this
looks like for you,

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.905 align:middle line:84%
because for every single
person, it's different.

00:16:57.905 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally different, yeah.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe you want the--

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Senior executive
advertising job.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:90%
And that's cool.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you just want to be
the best mom you can be.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:84%
>> So whatever it is that
you want in your health,

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:84%
in your career, in your
relationships getting really

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:84%
clear on that and then freeing
yourself of that limiting

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:84%
belief, those backpacks,
putting that down,

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that nothing
changes if nothing changes.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.849 align:middle line:90%
You want these things.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:29.510 align:middle line:84%
But you're not willing to let
go of the limiting beliefs.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing
that is stopping us

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
from having what
we truly desire.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.515 align:middle line:84%
We've got to
remember that nothing

00:17:36.515 --> 00:17:37.640 align:middle line:90%
changes if nothing changes.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.265 align:middle line:84%
If you want something
different, you've

00:17:39.265 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:90%
got to do something different.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:84%
You've got to change
that limiting belief.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's not just about
doing something different.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:84%
It's about believing
something different.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And believing
you're worth it.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Or believing that you have the
capability to do something.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Or believing that you can
attract the perfect soul mate

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.050 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to--

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and I think a lot of
our belief systems

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
are unconsciously conditioned
upon us, like you said,

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:90%
from the environment.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
big challenge.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any examples of
maybe some personal stories

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.675 align:middle line:84%
or from yourself
or people you've

00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:84%
worked with where they've been
able to shift their belief

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle line:84%
systems and they've
had an awakening

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:90%
in an area of their life?

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:90%
You're so right.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we're
born into this world

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:90%
with these limiting beliefs.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It could have been your mother's
and your mother's mother

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and your
great-great-great-great.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
It's that lineage stuff, that
DNA stuff that gets passed on.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And whatever we don't
resolve within ourselves,

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:90%
we pass on down to our children.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But I had one client who became
one of my really good friends.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And her parents separated,
and she believed

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:90%
that relationships were tough.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was her
limiting belief.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And she carried that through
her life, all of her teen years

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.890 align:middle line:90%
and then in her 20s.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:90%
And she got married.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And she had two
beautiful children.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And she was married
for 20 years.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And she realized that
that wasn't her truth

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and that she was
in a relationship

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.540 align:middle line:90%
for the wrong reasons.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, well,
and we spoke about the love

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.770 align:middle line:90%
over fear concept.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And afterward, I
said to her, when

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:84%
did you realize that
this was not your truth?

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
knew for 17 years.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, that
just blew my mind.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:90%
And I said, how did that feel?

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.523 align:middle line:84%
And she was very
open and very honest.

00:19:27.523 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I lived
a lie for 17 years.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I was convincing myself
that this was my truth,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:84%
that this relationship
was right for me, that you

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
had to push through
because relationships

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.680 align:middle line:84%
were hard work because that
was her limiting belief.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until we
started to work together

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:90%
that her eyes just opened up.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, oh my god,
I didn't come here to suffer.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I didn't come here
to play the victim

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:90%
and to have a tough life.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And she learned the
love over fear concept,

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:90%
and she really freed herself.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And she was able
to really dial up

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.952 align:middle line:84%
her worthyometer, which is
what I talk about in the book--

00:20:09.952 --> 00:20:10.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Her worthyometer.

00:20:10.785 --> 00:20:11.040 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.582 align:middle line:84%
>> --really dial up
her worthyometer,

00:20:12.582 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
really flex her
self-love muscle,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and have the confidence
to follow her truth.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And that relationship
dissolved really beautifully.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:84%
There was no dramatic
fights and painful

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.950 align:middle line:84%
because she just did
the work on herself.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to resolve
that and move forward

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:90%
with as much ease and grace.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there was heartache.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there was pain.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:42.337 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that those things
are never going to happen.

00:20:42.337 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:84%
But she was able to
glide through them

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.160 align:middle line:84%
with a lot more grace than if
she didn't have that awareness.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:90%
That's really cool.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I know, for me
personally, working

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
on limiting beliefs has
been such a huge part of me

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.160 align:middle line:84%
transitioning from a
ship's officer and seafarer

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:90%
into a filmmaker.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could have had
every story under the sun

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.990 align:middle line:90%
to think that I couldn't do it.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.060 align:middle line:90%
I have no experience.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the background.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.042 align:middle line:90%
None of my family are in film.

00:21:09.042 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And yet, our films have been
seen by tens of millions

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.737 align:middle line:84%
of people around the world
because we conquered a lot

00:21:13.737 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:90%
of those limiting beliefs.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really a big,
big fan of that work.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:84%
That is what is
holding people back.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
holding people back

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:90%
at the start line of their race.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:84%
They're not even willing to
start running because they're

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:90%
just so much fear.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Those limiting
beliefs are so noisy.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.470 align:middle line:90%
They're just so loud.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And my whole book
is around mastering

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.560 align:middle line:84%
that voice inside your head
because everyone has an ego.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And me, 10 years ago, my mean--
and I call her your mean girl.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:84%
You can call her your
bad boy, call him

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:84%
your bad boy, or
your ego, or Elvis.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what you call it.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But everyone has that fear
based voice inside their head.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you learn how
to master that voice,

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
you will live a
very different life.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.990 align:middle line:90%
So much more joy and fun.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And like I said
before, that doesn't

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:84%
mean it's going to be rainbows
and butterflies and unicorns.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.620 align:middle line:84%
There will be
things that happen,

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.020 align:middle line:84%
but you are able to
shimmy through them

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.750 align:middle line:84%
with a lot more grace and
gratitude at the other end.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I can definitely
appreciate that.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So a question I have
for you, Mel, now

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
is that if you think
about life as two paths

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:84%
because, generally, that's
how philosophy approaches it.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
You basically have
choices in life.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:90%
But let's say there's two paths.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Now the path of fear, I would
say, is a very well-lit path.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a very well-paved path.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's
walking down that path.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you walk into most
cities or most environments

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:84%
these days, and people are
living in a fear based state.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.070 align:middle line:84%
They're fearful about, I
don't have enough money.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a relationship
because I need

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:50.940 align:middle line:84%
to be here to have
that companionship,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:90%
and I don't really love them.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
But I'm scared about getting
out of the relationship.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm eating this way because
I don't want to get fat.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:84%
There's always fear
based approach, right?

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the love based
approach almost looks a bit

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:90%
like a permaculture garden.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.440 align:middle line:84%
There's weeds growing on
the path a little bit.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.690 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of flowers,
and it's pretty.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a bit
grotty and dirty.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.830 align:middle line:90%
And there's less people there.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.250 align:middle line:84%
How do you help people
go down that path

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
the well-lit path?

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
If I think about
medicine as well,

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:84%
you've got conventional
medicine and then alternative

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and conventional therapy,
I mean, natural therapies.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And that was the path that
we had to guide my dad down.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's not easy.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:90%
There's less support.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:84%
You tend to get alienated
unless you're hanging out

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:84%
with your tribe and posse like
you do with your little girl

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.240 align:middle line:90%
event and that.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And some guys come,
I'm sure, hopefully.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I'll come.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you help people, guide
them down that path of the road

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:90%
less traveled?

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Because it is a contrarian
approach to life.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest thing I've
realized is that I can't tell

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:90%
people to do it.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.220 align:middle line:90%
They have to have an experience.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So the best way
to inspire anyone,

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:84%
whether it's your
partner or your children,

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:84%
is to be the example and
to give them an experience.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's no point
in me going, Jimmy,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.713 align:middle line:84%
come down the well-lit path,
like come down the love path.

00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:90%
It's so much more fun.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.005 align:middle line:84%
There's rainbows
and butterflies.

00:24:11.005 --> 00:24:12.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's way more fun.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:90%
You could be like, nah.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:84%
But until you have an experience
of what it's like to choose

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:84%
love instead of
fear, and you know.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.180 align:middle line:84%
We all have had those
experiences before.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Until you really start to
flex your self-love muscle

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and you flex that muscle every
day, it's going to pull you.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what charms you most?

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always like
when I was in hospital,

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:84%
that tiny little
glimmer of hope,

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:84%
even though it was
like literally this big

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't really see
it or contextualize it,

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:90%
it charmed me.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And it just pulled
me and pulled me.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's everything
I do in my life now

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:90%
is about what charms me most.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Does the fear path charm
me more or the love path?

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes I forget.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes my
mean girl is noisy.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.538 align:middle line:84%
And she tries to take
me down that path.

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And I might start going down
there for like 10 minutes.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm like, whoa.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:90%
This is dark down here.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:90%
It stinks.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.280 align:middle line:90%
I want to go walk down--

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Back to the garden.

00:25:15.197 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to go
back to the garden.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And the whole first
section of the book

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:84%
is about changing your
internal GPS system.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So for a lot of us, that
internal GPS is set on fear.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
continue to bring it back

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.162 align:middle line:90%
to get it set on love.

00:25:31.162 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's going
to be things that

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:84%
are going to take
us off our path,

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.905 align:middle line:90%
and it's our job to come back.

00:25:35.905 --> 00:25:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be
something else that's

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.170 align:middle line:90%
going to take us off our path.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.795 align:middle line:84%
And we've just got
to keep coming back.

00:25:40.795 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And the more we practice
it in those moments

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.210 align:middle line:84%
when we really need it,
when shit has hit the fan,

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.720 align:middle line:84%
they're the moments that we have
to practice it not the moments

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.120 align:middle line:84%
when it's all happy
and butterflies.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really great to talk
about the fear path or the love

00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.830 align:middle line:90%
path.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.120 align:middle line:90%
And I've got a really good--

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.530 align:middle line:84%
I've got a better
concept of that now.

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:04.572 align:middle line:84%
And I think anybody
listening would have a better

00:26:04.572 --> 00:26:05.812 align:middle line:90%
understanding of that now.

00:26:05.812 --> 00:26:07.270 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about, what are some

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.520 align:middle line:84%
of the practical ways that
people can integrate this

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.050 align:middle line:84%
into their lives, that
people can help to cultivate

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.690 align:middle line:84%
that love based approach
to themselves and to life

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and in order to be
able to continue

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:84%
to attract the situations
and the experiences

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.800 align:middle line:90%
that they want more of?

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think one of the
best things you can do

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:84%
is realize that there is
only ever two choices.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I think us women, we sometimes
think that, oh, well,

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:90%
I could do this.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:90%
And I could do this.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But then that voice
is saying that.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.478 align:middle line:84%
But then that voice said
that I should do that.

00:26:38.478 --> 00:26:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we sometimes feel
like we have 50 choices.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.200 align:middle line:84%
But there is only ever
two, love or fear.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And coming back to that and
reminding yourself of that

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:90%
is really, really important.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So I've got that little
three-step process

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.070 align:middle line:84%
of every time that
fear based voice

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:58.570 align:middle line:84%
comes up, being aware of it,
gently closing the door on it,

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:90%
and then choosing love instead.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a very simple process that
we can apply to everyday life.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.250 align:middle line:90%
So can we do that live now?

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So can I pretend
I'm the fear voice?

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so don't eat that.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do it,
you're going to get fat.

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so I'm aware that that
is my mean girl or your bad boy.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:90%
So I'm aware.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:90%
That's not my truth.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.840 align:middle line:90%
That is that voice.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And your ego speaks
to you in words.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Your intuition, love
speaks to you in feelings.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.588 align:middle line:84%
So mainly, anything
that goes on up here--

00:27:29.588 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Like internal dialogue talk.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Internal dialogue
is your ego.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.677 align:middle line:84%
>> It's because your
intuition love, it's more--

00:27:36.677 --> 00:27:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've ever
had one of those experiences

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:42.100 align:middle line:84%
where someone might have
said to you, well, why

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:90%
did you book a trip to Bali?

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:44.580 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, I don't know.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I just had this feeling like
something was just telling me.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.530 align:middle line:90%
And it just pulled me.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure everyone's had
an experience like that.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So that voice pops up
and says, don't eat that.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.400 align:middle line:90%
So we've become aware of it.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.880 align:middle line:84%
We know that's our mean
girl or our bad boy.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And once you know what you
know, you can't unknow it.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:05.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So once the awareness
is there, it's there.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.370 align:middle line:90%
You can't pretend.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:90%
You can't be like, yeah, I know.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:10.900 align:middle line:90%
That's not my mean girl.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Unless you have one of
those "Men in Black"

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.220 align:middle line:84%
guns that they like zap
you and erase your memory.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'm pretty sure--

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Nobody has that.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> --no one has one of those.

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.000 align:middle line:90%
So awareness is key.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Then with that awareness,
you have an opportunity

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:84%
to gently close
the door on that.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not about killing the ego.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.815 align:middle line:90%
It's not about smashing the ego.

00:28:30.815 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a lot
of spiritual texts

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:84%
that talk about killing the
ego or smashing the ego.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:36.448 align:middle line:84%
>> Ego eradication,
all that, yeah.

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>> It's part of us.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And I see it as a way to
get back on your path.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I use my mean girl
as my indicator

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:46.250 align:middle line:90%
to get back on to love.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:90%
It's like an element for growth.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:90%
Ego is helping you grow.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Turn it around.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.873 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an opportunity
for growth, exactly.

00:28:53.873 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So then we gently
close the door on her.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And then we choose
to reframe it.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.360 align:middle line:90%
We choose love instead.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So instead of that
fear based thought

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:84%
around what you were eating,
you could say, you know what?

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually going
to choose this

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:09.175 align:middle line:84%
because I love my body so
much, and I want to nourish it,

00:29:09.175 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and I want to look after, and I
want to feel vital and healthy.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
different energy behind it.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's just about
taking yourself

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:90%
through those three steps.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.380 align:middle line:90%
They're very simple.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:25.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's not normal
for us because we've

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.740 align:middle line:90%
been conditioned--

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>> To do it the opposite.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>> --to do it the opposite.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.583 align:middle line:84%
>> All the advertising
we see on television.

00:29:30.583 --> 00:29:31.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:31.383 --> 00:29:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything we
see is all about,

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.670 align:middle line:84%
don't do that because
this will happen.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Fear based approach.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.447 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
other things I wanted

00:29:38.447 --> 00:29:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to bring up around food because
I think the relationship

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.010 align:middle line:90%
to food is a big thing.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.258 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
struggle with it,

00:29:45.258 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:90%
and they know about that.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't struggle with it.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.780 align:middle line:84%
But they don't yet know
that it is coming up

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.697 align:middle line:84%
for them in that way,
that they're conditioned

00:29:51.697 --> 00:29:53.140 align:middle line:90%
around food in that way.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking a
little bit earlier before

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:01.810 align:middle line:84%
about how approaching good
food with love and nourishment

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.060 align:middle line:84%
but approaching also if
we don't eat that well,

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.513 align:middle line:90%
approaching that with love.

00:30:05.513 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about that because
that's a different thing.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
say, I don't want

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.223 align:middle line:84%
to eat that because I
don't want to get fat.

00:30:11.223 --> 00:30:13.490 align:middle line:84%
But then if you do eat
something that is not perfect,

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:90%
how do we--

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.800 align:middle line:84%
what's a healthy way
to approach that?

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It's about ultimately
being your best,

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:24.690 align:middle line:84%
being your own best friend,
being the nicest, loving,

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:29.520 align:middle line:84%
kind person you can be to
yourself in every moment.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you fall down, when
you overeat, like a child.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.130 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't go to Hugo,
oh, you stupid idiot.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Get up.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:84%
You'd be like, up
you get, darling.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's have another go.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.460 align:middle line:84%
But we speak to
ourselves so horribly.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Like you would never speak
to your worst enemy the way

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that some of us women
speak to ourselves.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if
it's the same for men.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But some of the dialogue that
us women say to ourselves

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.080 align:middle line:90%
like you would be mortified.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And you would not speak to
your own worst enemy like that.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we allow our mean
girl to do it to us.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:90%
And that has got to stop.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.600 align:middle line:84%
That berating,
that limiting, fear

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.640 align:middle line:84%
based talk that we
have toward ourself

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:84%
is what is holding you
back at the start line.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And you're never going
to be able to go.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.120 align:middle line:84%
You're never going to be
able to go on your path.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's about being the
most loving, kind person that I

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
can be to myself when I
fall down, when I overeat,

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:34.250 align:middle line:84%
when I miss my gym session in
the morning, when I stuff up.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.320 align:middle line:84%
In those moments,
going, you know what?

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.120 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.080 align:middle line:90%
And I love you anyway.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:39.800 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.600 align:middle line:90%
You're a rockstar.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>> You're amazing.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.350 align:middle line:90%
You're a babe.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Black give yourself a
little wink in the mirror.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the opposite of what
most people would do, though.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you're saying.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>> And if you can practice that.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And what if that feels
uncomfortable in the beginning?

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.723 align:middle line:84%
>> It will feel very,
very uncomfortable.

00:31:54.723 --> 00:31:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So like, hey,
I missed the gym.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But, hey, look in
the mirror and say,

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.030 align:middle line:84%
look, I accept myself
unconditionally right now,

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:00.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And I love myself,
and I'm OK with that.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:02.715 align:middle line:90%
I'm cool.

00:32:02.715 --> 00:32:03.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:32:03.515 --> 00:32:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
affirmations and mirror

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.720 align:middle line:84%
work, which is what Louise Hay
talks about, are so powerful

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and so revolutionized the
way I looked at myself.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.220 align:middle line:90%
I hated myself.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.460 align:middle line:90%
I was so hard on myself.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I was very, very
horrible to myself.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.340 align:middle line:90%
My internal dialogue was awful.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And because I didn't know
that there was another way.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I first started doing
affirmations and mirror work,

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even look at
myself in the mirror.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I would just stream and
stream and stream and stream

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:40.620 align:middle line:84%
because there was so much
pain and so much hurt.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.490 align:middle line:84%
But I did a lot of
unconditional love

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:49.210 align:middle line:84%
toward myself and visualizing
myself as a six-year-old.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And would I speak to my
six-year-old self like that?

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.040 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:53.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course not, yeah.

00:32:53.998 --> 00:32:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>> No way.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, just having
such a loving relationship

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.260 align:middle line:84%
with yourself will
really help you

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:90%
achieve what you want in life.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, it was like
every time I stuffed up,

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:08.880 align:middle line:90%
I would beat myself up.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And now, every time I fall
down, I'm like, great.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:12.450 align:middle line:90%
What did I learn?

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.600 align:middle line:90%
How can I grow and evolve?

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It's changing that mindset.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And that wasn't always0--

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.280 align:middle line:90%
that was not my reality.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.900 align:middle line:90%
I had to work on that.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
self-love things

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about and
choosing love over fear

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:31.420 align:middle line:84%
is something that you have
to work on moment to moment

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:90%
to moment.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that you can just

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.450 align:middle line:84%
do on Wednesdays and
Saturdays and then expect

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:37.430 align:middle line:90%
to be enlightened.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Practicing self-love,
choosing love over fear,

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.060 align:middle line:84%
mastering your mean girl
is a daily moment to moment

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.410 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that the more you

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:49.410 align:middle line:84%
flex, it's like you
go into the gym,

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.660 align:middle line:84%
the more you do your squats,
the tighter your booty.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:52.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:52.026 --> 00:33:52.760 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So you've just got to flex
that muscle in every moment.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.100 align:middle line:90%
And it does get easier.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So we've covered a lot of theory
about limiting beliefs, moving

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.800 align:middle line:84%
from fear into love,
and understanding

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that process of how we
connect with ourselves

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and not necessarily
negate the ego

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:84%
but use its power in order to
be able to fuel that self-growth

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:90%
and self-love.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.639 align:middle line:84%
But let's land the
plane on this now.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:20.969 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little bit about
what are some daily rituals

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:23.420 align:middle line:84%
or practices that I could
introduce into my life

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.170 align:middle line:84%
or that people listening
to this interview

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:26.837 align:middle line:84%
could introduce into
their life in order

00:34:26.837 --> 00:34:31.020 align:middle line:84%
to be able to really make
it easy for them to build

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.500 align:middle line:84%
up more, like you said,
flexing their muscles

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and build up more
strength in this way.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, for me, personally,
the biggest thing has been

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:43.949 align:middle line:84%
It has radically
changed my life.

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.917 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to look a certain way.

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:47.250 align:middle line:90%
You could do guided meditations.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:48.270 align:middle line:90%
You could do gardening.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.320 align:middle line:90%
You could do surfing.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:54.239 align:middle line:84%
You could do whatever
allows you to just go inward

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and to feel that
juicy bliss spot.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:58.770 align:middle line:90%
And we all know it.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.330 align:middle line:90%
We've all felt it.

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So cultivating some sort of
meditation practice, for me,

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:07.240 align:middle line:84%
it's the first thing I
do as soon as I wake up.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I do 20 minutes in the
morning and 20 minutes

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.760 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.770 align:middle line:90%
And that really helps me.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:16.160 align:middle line:84%
It helps with anxiety,
overwhelmed, stress,

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.790 align:middle line:90%
all those sorts of things.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that has been
imperative because your ego

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
cannot live in the
present moment.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Your ego is there
when you're stressing

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.380 align:middle line:84%
over the past and
anxious about the future.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in the
past or the future,

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.150 align:middle line:84%
that's when your
mean girl comes in.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.917 align:middle line:84%
Your ego plants all
these seeds of doubts.

00:35:36.917 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:90%
You should have done this.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.720 align:middle line:90%
You're not good enough.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.827 align:middle line:90%
You're not smart enough.

00:35:39.827 --> 00:35:40.910 align:middle line:90%
You should have said this.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:42.020 align:middle line:90%
You haven't done this.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.530 align:middle line:84%
But when you're present,
you're in the moment,

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and there's no internal
dialogue because you're

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.530 align:middle line:84%
just here in this
beautiful moment right now.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So by practicing some
sort of meditation

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.500 align:middle line:84%
strengthens that
presence muscle.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're constantly
being pulled out

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:02.520 align:middle line:84%
of the present moment all
the time with social media,

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.740 align:middle line:90%
with TV.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just like pull
out, pull out, pull out.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So we have to work a little
bit more to flex that muscle

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:90%
and come back.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So meditation, some form
of meditative practice.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got five
kids under the age of five,

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:84%
maybe your meditation is
just three deep belly breaths

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:27.050 align:middle line:84%
whilst you're on the
toilet or in the shower

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:31.220 align:middle line:84%
or whilst you're sitting at the
traffic lights, just breathing.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.130 align:middle line:84%
It's about finding those
little moments where

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:37.090 align:middle line:84%
you can drop in
wherever you can,

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.625 align:middle line:84%
standing at the post office,
standing at the bank,

00:36:40.625 --> 00:36:41.750 align:middle line:90%
just finding those moments.

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what I personally do.

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.190 align:middle line:84%
It's about finding
those white spaces

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and just not filling them
because our immediate reaction

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.880 align:middle line:84%
is to usually fill
them with this.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.160 align:middle line:84%
But to not fill them
and just breathe.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.310 align:middle line:90%
So powerful.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably the
first thing that I suggest.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.745 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I ask you quickly
on that first point around

00:37:00.745 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:90%
the meditation.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.670 align:middle line:84%
You've given me some tips
about approaching meditation

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:05.610 align:middle line:90%
in day-to-day life.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.150 align:middle line:84%
But how do you approach
your practice of meditation?

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I learned I started
with guided meditations.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I started with just 10
minute guided meditations.

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.400 align:middle line:90%
And that really helped me.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.000 align:middle line:84%
So I would just
wake up and either

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.370 align:middle line:84%
sit on a cushion on the
floor or in the lounge room.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:23.660 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be a--

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.040 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
have an ashram.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.630 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to have an altar.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:27.450 align:middle line:90%
You can sit.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:28.250 align:middle line:90%
I meditate.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.130 align:middle line:84%
If I go to pick up my stepson
from school and I'm early,

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:32.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll meditate in the car.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.950 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
look a certain way.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I started
with guided meditations.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Now I practice TM, which
you get given a mantra.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And I really like that
type of meditation.

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.670 align:middle line:84%
That's working for
me at the moment,

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.730 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just loving that.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.950 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, you can just do
what feels good for you.

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Don't compare yourself
to other people.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Try a few on for size and
go, oh, that feels good.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try that and
just see how that goes.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I did that six years ago,
and I'm still doing it.

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's just about trying
what feels good for you

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and not being attached to it
being in a perfect situation

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:12.188 align:middle line:84%
with candles and ganesh
and some incense.

00:38:12.188 --> 00:38:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't have to look like that.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, cool.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:14.460 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Just however is perfect.

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:18.125 align:middle line:84%
So step one was
meditation, that presence.

00:38:18.125 --> 00:38:19.042 align:middle line:90%
So sorry to interrupt.

00:38:19.042 --> 00:38:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.540 align:middle line:84%
I think step two is
cultivating some sort

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.720 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual practice.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of ties
into the meditation.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:31.220 align:middle line:90%
But I find yoga really powerful.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Because for so many years,
I exercised out of fear.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.140 align:middle line:84%
I would go to the gym and
flog my body out of fear.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.600 align:middle line:84%
But cultivating some
sort of movement,

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and whether it's
qigong or tao yin,

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.680 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to be a
certain thing but movement

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.650 align:middle line:90%
and meditation at the same time.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.660 align:middle line:90%
That's why yoga is so powerful.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And some mornings, all
I get is five minutes

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:59.390 align:middle line:84%
because I've got
school lunches to make

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and school drop off
and things like that.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And other mornings, I
might get 20 minutes.

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's just whatever
you can fit in.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But exercise, doing the yoga
not as a form of exercise

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:84%
but as a form of a
spiritual practice

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:17.088 align:middle line:84%
is really going to strengthen
your self-love muscle.

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And spiritual practice is a
connection to the self as well

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:20.430 align:middle line:90%
mostly.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I think the third thing
is some sort of self-love act.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Now I have created this thing
called the self-love menu.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:36.095 align:middle line:84%
And it's where you
write down 10 things.

00:39:36.095 --> 00:39:37.220 align:middle line:90%
And I've got it in my book.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:84%
You write down 10 things
that really light you up.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So it could be
watching a sunrise

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.940 align:middle line:84%
or playing with
Hugo and Laurentine.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Or getting a massage.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Getting a massage or
reading a book on the beach.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Or going for a
swim in the ocean.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.447 align:middle line:84%
>> Going for a swim in the
ocean, watching a sunset,

00:39:51.447 --> 00:39:53.180 align:middle line:84%
having a picnic
with your family.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So you write down these 10
things on your self-love menu.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:58.460 align:middle line:90%
You stick it on your fridge.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And any time you want to go
and down a packet of chips

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.300 align:middle line:84%
or biscuits or a block of
chocolate or ice cream,

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that menu is going
to be on your fridge.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And you want to fill yourself
up with one of those things.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to filling yourself
up from the outside in,

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:17.570 align:middle line:84%
you're going to fill yourself
up from the inside out.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So you do something off
your self-love menu.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And do one of those
things every day.

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's just having
a cup of tea by yourself

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.130 align:middle line:84%
or swimming in the ocean or
just taking your shoes off

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and feeling your feet on
the grass or the sand.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So the meditation is
probably the first thing,

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.460 align:middle line:84%
some form of yoga
spiritual practice,

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and then doing one thing of
your self-love menu every day.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Because we can just get so
busy, and there's so many,

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and you'll notice in my book
that I banish the word busy.

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:51.618 align:middle line:90%
Busy is not in my vocabulary.

00:40:51.618 --> 00:40:52.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:52.418 --> 00:40:53.230 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:54.605 align:middle line:84%
I've never over
used it too much.

00:40:54.605 --> 00:40:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And I am really cautious of
when I use that word now.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm too busy.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I've been so busy lately.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:01.750 align:middle line:90%
You can't say that.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I've been loving what I do.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Full.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been full of some
great exciting projects.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Because busy has this negative
connotation that comes with it.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And in modern society, we wear
busy like a badge of honor.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's like, bravo.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.710 align:middle line:90%
You pulled an all nighter.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially in the medical
fraternity of all places.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Like I did two back to
back shifts or I did this.

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's a bad idea.

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:84%
We're the only
culture that's really

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.740 align:middle line:90%
become addicted to busyness.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at some of
these traditional cultures that

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.402 align:middle line:84%
have banished that idea, Tibetan
cultures and their beliefs,

00:41:34.402 --> 00:41:36.110 align:middle line:84%
some of these traditional
Vedic cultures,

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.175 align:middle line:84%
they don't even
understand the term busy.

00:41:38.175 --> 00:41:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:38.805 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:38.805 --> 00:41:41.263 align:middle line:84%
>> They're just so present with
their life that they're not

00:41:41.263 --> 00:41:42.850 align:middle line:90%
at all involved in that trivia.

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> We could learn
a lot from them.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Go back and see how they did
it, those beautiful cultures,

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and we could learn
so much from them.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So those three things are things
that really helped me, helped

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:59.440 align:middle line:84%
me stay on my love path, and
not detour off onto the fear,

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and stay on my
path, my true path.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Mel, it's been so great
chatting with you today.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I love the book.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I love the message
that you stand for.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just absolutely
love that people

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:14.010 align:middle line:84%
can help really expand the
quality and the passion

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that they can live
their life with by both

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.590 align:middle line:90%
moving from fear into love.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.550 align:middle line:90%
You're a champion.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for sharing
this with me today.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, so grateful.

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:31.000 align:middle line:90%
