00:00:06.902 --> 00:00:26.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.802 align:middle line:84%
It's James here
from "Food Matters,"

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and welcome to this
special interview

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Kellyann Petrucci.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.760 align:middle line:84%
She is the founder
of drkellyann.com,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and also the best selling
author of "The Bone Broth Diet."

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
She is an amazing
superstar when it

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:84%
comes to reversing aging,
looking more beautiful.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.383 align:middle line:84%
She's living proof of that,
and understanding all things

00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:44.842 align:middle line:84%
about bone broth,
and how important

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:84%
it is to look after our
gut and our skin health.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Kellyanne, how are you?

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm doing wonderful.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:90%
So happy to be here.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So, you know, bone broth
is something that has been out

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.400 align:middle line:90%
of the landscape of the food--

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.612 align:middle line:90%
>> --sort of diet for a while.

00:00:57.612 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And you've helped
bring it to prominence.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:84%
How was it that you
discovered this?

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I'm
so proud of that,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
because there really is a
bone broth revolution now.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's started because I
know what a lot of people

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:90%
that are watching this need.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And I found out
myself the hard way,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
because, bam, I hit a wall
when I turned 40, I hit a wall.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And here I was, a successful
clinician, successful doctor.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Saw tons of patients, and
I really did know my stuff.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So why is it that I'm 40 years
old, and I'm hitting a wall?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And what I found out was
that as we go through life

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and we go through different
turnstiles of life,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:84%
we really start changing
our needs a little bit.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies start changing.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And we need really good
nutrition as we move forward.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- I can't explain
how important this is,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:84%
to get the toxins out of the
body, push the nutrition in.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:90%
That's the pathway.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Get those toxins
out of the body,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
push the nutrition
into the cells.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:84%
When that happens,
bam, the magic happens,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
and what astounded
me, James, was

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that when I started using this
crazy thing called bone broth,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:90%
I saw results that were typical.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.142 align:middle line:84%
So as a clinician, when you
see results that are typical,

00:02:14.142 --> 00:02:15.100 align:middle line:90%
it gets your attention.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.017 align:middle line:84%
>> So bone broth is a
really interesting topic

00:02:17.017 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
because for a lot of
people, especially for me,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
for many years, I ate, you know,
vegetarian, really clean foods,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:90%
lots of plant-based foods.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And recently, I have been
introducing some bone broth,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:84%
as I've learned more about the
powers and properties it has

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
for gut health and
supporting the mucosals

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:90%
and the lining of the gut.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:84%
But it is a little bit
controversial still

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
for are a lot of people coming
to this for the first time.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:90%
How do you respond to that?

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, two ways.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Number one, remember what the
whole premise behind food,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and research, and really
getting the research

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%
that we need to say, hey,
look, this definitively works.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:90%
We know this works.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I know it works because
I've tested it out.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But there's been no global
scale test that says,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:90%
this absolutely works 100%.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I only know it's worked
with thousands and thousands

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:90%
of people that have written in.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I know that what we
see-- the results

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:90%
that we've seen clinically.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:90%
It makes such a big difference.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:90%
The controversy comes in--

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.150 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, I'm a
vegetarian, or I am a vegan,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and this is not something
that I would prefer to use.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And what I say to that is I
am personally responsible.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll just say it.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm personally responsible for
converting many vegetarians.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And they call themselves
mini converted.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's people that, you
know, are at this event now

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
that have converted, because
the protein that is in the bone

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:90%
broth is amazing for the body.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.560 align:middle line:84%
You have amino acids that
are amazing for the body.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.260 align:middle line:84%
You've got minerals that
are amazing for the body.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And the best part is you've
got that cooked collagen, which

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:90%
is gelatin.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's a really key word.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Because this
gelatin is explosive

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:84%
in the body in the most positive
way, because it does something

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:90%
called healing the gut.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And those are three words
that everyone really needs

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:90%
to key into, listen to here.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Because in my experience, if you
were to put all of my patients

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:84%
into a football field, all
the years of seeing people

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.180 align:middle line:84%
in clinic, and I were
to dilute it down,

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
to really dial it down to
what are the three things that

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.085 align:middle line:84%
were most common
in every patient,

00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
no matter what they
were coming in for,

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
modern day issue--

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
whether it's heart disease,
whether it's cancer,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:84%
whether it's diabetes,
whether it's obesity,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
whether it's some kind of
chronic autoimmune problem.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's this.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Number one, had to heal the gut.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Number two, I had to get
that inflammation down.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And number three, I had to
teach them to teach their body

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:90%
to be a natural fat burner.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Those three things
are essential.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:84%
They are absolutely essential
to becoming slimmer,

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
to becoming younger,
and to really being

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
a strong, powerful machine
that you really can be.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:90%
I assure you, you can.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
No matter where
anyone is now, you

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
can develop that in your
body and in your life.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And so what I love
about bone broth--

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and I have to tell you I have
done some amazing studies

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:84%
overseas, studying Switzerland,
and London, and really amazing

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.875 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Incredible treatments,
modalities, I

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:90%
could talk about forever.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Why in the world am I hooking
just on the bone broth?

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Because when I tell you, again,
that the results that we see

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:90%
are typical--

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:84%
better skin, aches and
pains that are gone.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
We use the bone brought to
help people get slimmer.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:90%
They get a shot of energy.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:90%
They sleep better.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.070 align:middle line:84%
When I see things like
that that are so typical,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I am going to make
sure you know about it.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I love bone broth,
because it does those three

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It reduces inflammation,
it heals the gut,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and it teaches your body to
become this natural fat burner.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.202 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about beauty
for a minute, because you

00:06:03.202 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:90%
touched on collagen, which is--

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
people pay so much to
look after their skin.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, we put
creams and ointments

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
on our skin topically, and a lot
of those creams and ointments

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of toxins in them.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>> They sure do.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> But let's look at nourishing
the body from the inside out.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you don't discount
the benefits that green plant

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:84%
foods, healthy vegetables,
beautiful healthy fats,

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.942 align:middle line:84%
you know, good quality
proteins have in the diet.

00:06:25.942 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:84%
But bone broth's like, your
little secret weapon, isn't it?

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:90%
You love it.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And is this something that you
love because of how effective

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
it is at beautifying the skin
and making-- because you're

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful woman.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm comfortable
saying that on screen.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And, you know, you said you
passed your 40th birthday--

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Way past.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Way past.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>> A number of years ago.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:90%
A number of years ago.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.025 align:middle line:84%
>> And I don't say
that to just anyone,

00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:48.107 align:middle line:90%
so you should feel good.

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It's on the record now.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So let me-- tell me a little
bit about how powerful

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.710 align:middle line:84%
bone brought is for improving
your beauty and your skin.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm going to tell
you a really big secret.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.410 align:middle line:84%
When I first came out with
the concept of the book,

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:84%
"The Bone Broth
Diet," I was slammed

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:84%
from the people closest to
me, my friends, my colleagues.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Most people in mainstream,
most people in mainstream,

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:90%
said, you're kidding me.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:90%
Bone broth?

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:90%
That is so not sexy.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.500 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to sell one book.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.625 align:middle line:84%
They were surprised when
it became a New York Times

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:90%
bestseller.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Because it really did
sell, because it works.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:84%
The ew escapes the
mind immediately

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:84%
when you know what
it does for you.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:90%
So they were really surprised.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.293 align:middle line:84%
They said, the secret
is, oh, my gosh, you're

00:07:29.293 --> 00:07:31.460 align:middle line:84%
coming up the diet book,
which are all about health.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who knows me and
knows anything about me

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:90%
knows I'm all about health.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing
about bone broth.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:84%
It gets you so stinking
healthy, that your body's

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.120 align:middle line:84%
got no choice, no
choice, but to radiate.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:90%
And what do I mean by radiate?

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
It gives you beautiful
luster-filled skin.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's a really
big difference

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.540 align:middle line:84%
between concentrating
on just one area.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So we know that there's a lot
going on with a lot of fillers

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of Botox, and
all of these products

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.030 align:middle line:84%
that people are
using on their skin.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But what if I told
you, what if I said,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.650 align:middle line:84%
it's not about
just concentrating

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:90%
on one little area.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.460 align:middle line:84%
It's about the overall luster
and demeanor of the skin.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.940 align:middle line:84%
You get this from collagen.
That's how you get it.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the glue that holds
your body together.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about your skin
cells, they're like like balls,

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So either they can be bouncy
balls or deflated balls.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.100 align:middle line:84%
When you give them the
nutrition they need,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.960 align:middle line:90%
they're no longer deflated.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
They're bouncy balls,
and their skin just

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:90%
becomes really beautiful.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is a wonderful side
effect of being super healthy.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.539 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Because you can assess someone.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.120 align:middle line:84%
A clinician can often tell a
lot about the person's health

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
by their skin, because it's
that gut connection again.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I told you the three
things that you

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.170 align:middle line:84%
need to do, that
needs to happen,

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:84%
for you to shine,
for you to radiate,

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
for you to become slimmer and
younger, healthier than ever.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
It's healing the gut, reducing
inflammation, becoming

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:90%
that natural fat burner.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.270 align:middle line:84%
This is what bone
broth does for you.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So you can use it to really
get your skin beautiful.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And here is another amazing
thing about bone broth.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I created something
called mini fasting.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a way to
burn stored fat.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.540 align:middle line:90%
So what's stored fat?

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Here, here, here, here.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.162 align:middle line:90%
The stuff here.

00:09:24.162 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:90%
All that stuff we don't want.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's stored fat.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do
that, the best way I've

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:90%
ever seen clinically--

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and we've done studies in
different cities and thousands

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:90%
of results--

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:84%
you sip on bone broth two
non-consecutive days a week.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:84%
You have one light meal at
7:00 PM, a healthy protein,

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
healthy fat, and some
kind of fibrous vegetable.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.380 align:middle line:90%
You have that at 7:00 PM.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Do that two non-consecutive
days a week,

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and you start really
getting in there,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.298 align:middle line:90%
and getting that stored fat.

00:09:57.298 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So you do bone broth
throughout the day,

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and then a light
meal in the evening.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Up to six cups of bone
broth during the day,

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:90%
two non-consecutive days.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:84%
One light meal at 7
o'clock if you need it.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So I don't usually do the
meal, but some people do.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is such a good way to
utilize intermittent fasting,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:90%
which we know works so well.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:90%
But some people, you know what?

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:84%
It makes them want to kick
everything and everyone.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.705 align:middle line:84%
So it makes some people ornery
and cranky and lightheaded,

00:10:24.705 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:90%
and all of these things.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a way to get
the exact same results

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:90%
without any of the discomfort.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's really-- it's been
magical for so many people.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, what-- you know, as
we think about this idea of bone

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.563 align:middle line:84%
broth and introducing
it into the diet--

00:10:42.563 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
so a lot of people
are wondering--

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:84%
are probably wondering, you
know, so how do I make it?

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.318 align:middle line:90%
How often should I have it?

00:10:48.318 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, because
it seems, you know,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
intermittent fasting, having
it a couple of days a week,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:84%
is a great way to
boost your health.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.942 align:middle line:84%
But on a long-term
basis, how do we make it,

00:10:55.942 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and how often should we
include it in our diet?

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:90%
So super easy.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And you have three
different options

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
on how you would
like to make this.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And one is the
slow cooker, which

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:90%
is my absolute favorite way.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:90%
One is in a regular stock pot.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:90%
One is in a pressure cooker.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And the advantage of
the pressure cooker

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:84%
is that it cooks it very
fast in about four hours.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So the difference-- and
let me just say this.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
bone broth and regular soup

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:84%
that you buy in a store is the
soup that you buy in a store,

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.760 align:middle line:84%
in addition to having a lot of
ingredients that really are not

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
friendly to us at all, a lot
of sodium and other products,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:90%
it's cooked very fast.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:84%
It's cooked without the bones,
and it's cooked very fast.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Bone broth is simmered
over a long period of time,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:84%
with these bones getting all
the goodness out of them.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And I have to also say,
we didn't mention this,

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:90%
and it's super important.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.702 align:middle line:90%
So, James, I'd like to add this.

00:11:46.702 --> 00:11:48.660 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest things
that we see in clinic

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:90%
is painful or achy joints.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I Love Bone broth for
achy joints, which

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:84%
is why so many athletes are
on bone broth for recovery,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and to just really
nurse the joints,

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
because it's got
all that chondroitin

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and glucosamine that
you get naturally.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's really important.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:90%
So how to make it?

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Super easy.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Again, three options.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Stock pot, slow cooker,
or pressure cooker.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:90%
All you do is take the bones.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
You can either use
a chicken carcass,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:90%
which is the easiest way.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.920 align:middle line:84%
You just use the
carcass of a chicken.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Get the best quality
that you can.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember, whatever
quality that you use,

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
it actually goes
right into your body.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It makes a huge difference.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.680 align:middle line:84%
That transference is
really important, so

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:90%
the best quality that you can.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So ideally,
organic, free range--

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>> That is ideal.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:90%
It really is the ideal.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's so much easier to get
now than it ever was before.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So you put the bones-- so say
you're using a chicken carcass.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.590 align:middle line:90%
You put the carcass into a pot.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.230 align:middle line:90%
And this is how easy it is.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I always use celery,
onions, and carrots,

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:84%
just because it gives
it that nice flavor.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.060 align:middle line:90%
It's so easy.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
All you do is cut the onion
four ways, throw it in the pot,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:84%
crack the carrots,
throw them in.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Celery, bam, one
cut, throw it in.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
You put water about 1
inch over everything.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever
spices that you want.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:90%
I love lemongrass.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:90%
That's my favorite.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I stick that in there,
whatever it is know.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Celtic sea salt, some
pepper, whatever.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:84%
You simmer that for
between 12 and 18 hours.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So for chicken, I
usually do about 12.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:90%
For beef, I usually do about 18.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And for fish, I keep
it to about nine hours.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So all of these,
super, super healthy.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:35.872 align:middle line:90%
Simmer it.

00:13:35.872 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
The slow cooker is the
best, because all you do

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:84%
is plug it in, turn
it on, and walk away.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:84%
It really comes
out so beautifully.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And what you want is that
wiggle, that gelatinous wiggle.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Because it's like gelatin.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:84%
It's really going to go in
there and heal that gut,

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.610 align:middle line:84%
reduce that inflammation,
and beautify your skin.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, using it
for slimming really

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:84%
works well when you're using
it with the mini fasting.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And also Penn State
did a study that

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.170 align:middle line:84%
showed when you use broths
and soups in your diet,

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:84%
you typically are about seven
to eight pounds less a year

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:90%
just naturally.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:09.860 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And so how would you
integrate this on a day

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:90%
to day basis in your diet like?

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, is it something
you'd have for breakfast?

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something
you'd have for dinner,

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.740 align:middle line:90%
or throughout the day?

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>> So I call this personal play.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.890 align:middle line:84%
It really depends on you
and what works best for you.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But we find that about two
cups a day tend to work best.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So one cup in the morning
really works well with people.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you get that afternoon
dip that so many of us get,

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:84%
that's when I always
go for the second cup.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.290 align:middle line:90%
That's really a beautiful way.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.855 align:middle line:84%
So if you say Dr.
Kellyann, I hear you.

00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's great.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to do
the whole diet thing.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I just want to put bone
broth into my life.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Just get bone broth into your
life once or twice a day.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:90%
Twice a day optimally.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:90%
And watch and see what happens.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean really you'll
see the magic happen.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So I have another
question now,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:84%
which has just come
up around this.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
The science and the attitude
to the approach of diet

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:90%
has evolved a lot.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> In the '80s, we went
from removing everything.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And now your suggestion
is just add in bone both.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, ideally
you want people

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:84%
to remove some of the
gluten containing grains,

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:84%
which can cause inflammation
and irritation to the gut wall.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Increasing green leafy
vegetables and, you know,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.250 align:middle line:90%
organic fruits and nuts.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I love green drinks.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:90%
So I do this a lot.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Let me just say this.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:90%
I make green drinks.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, I'll
put them in a Mason jar,

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'll just dunk it
right in the bone broth.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>> As well?

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I dunk it.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you imagine
the power of that?

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Green drinks and bone broth.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Combine those.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it just boggles my mind.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.230 align:middle line:90%
It's so powerful for the body.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:90%
It's like crazy.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is a way of
confusing the body

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:90%
in the most powerful way.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:84%
You're literally
confusing the body.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:90%
What, what, what, what?

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I have no choice
but to be healthy.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Just remember that.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're doing.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
You're giving your
body no choice.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
It's against natural law
for this not to work.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.895 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what really
feeds the cellular matrix.

00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.778 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:16:06.778 --> 00:16:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts you
want to leave people with?

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>> All I have to say is
that no matter how you feel,

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:18.230 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you are, you
really can create the you

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:90%
of your dreams.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.267 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that dream is
you have for yourself,

00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:22.100 align:middle line:90%
you can create that.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:90%
It's two things.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Number one just taking
action, just starting,

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:90%
just take action.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:90%
And number two, don't give up.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:30.863 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:16:30.863 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic chatting with you.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your time.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:33.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.865 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.
