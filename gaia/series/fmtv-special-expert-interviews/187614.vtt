00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to introduce
this special interview

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.700 align:middle line:84%
that I've recently shot
with Kristen Morrison.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Kristen has become
a friend of mine

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.230 align:middle line:84%
after learning a little bit
about her story with her son

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Griffin.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Kristen had two beautiful girls.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And they really hoped to
have a boy in their life.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were
waiting for Superman.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.740 align:middle line:84%
They were so excited
about having this boy.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.883 align:middle line:84%
And then he was born
with Down syndrome.

00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a
huge challenge to her,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:90%
because she was such a hippie.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:84%
She really had a natural
birth, a home birth.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really
big challenge.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.313 align:middle line:84%
It just pains me to
think about the anguish

00:00:33.313 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:90%
that she went through.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And reading a little
bit of her book,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.738 align:middle line:84%
"Naturally Better Kids,"
it's about her journey

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and what she's been
through and then really

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.240 align:middle line:84%
moving from a victim mentality
to a victor and really going,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:84%
how can I help use
this opportunity

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.260 align:middle line:84%
to create a beautiful
life for him.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.195 align:middle line:84%
And so she has worked
with the Institute

00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
for the Achievement of
Human Potential, which

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:84%
is whose interview I did
with Douglas Doman recently.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.380 align:middle line:84%
She's used a lot
of the techniques

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle line:84%
from that approach
and some of her own

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to develop
a holistic protocol to help

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:84%
heal his mind and body
as much as possible.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing seeing
the transformation that's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:90%
taken place in Griffin's life.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And this story is testament
to the fact that, no matter

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:84%
how challenging the illness,
be it a genetic disorder

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:84%
or something that's a
disease of lifestyle,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:84%
such as cancer or
heart disease, there

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:84%
is still so much
hope and so much

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:84%
that can be done to
help repair the body

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.750 align:middle line:90%
and heal the body naturally.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Kristen is a living
example of this.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So I really hope you
enjoy this interview.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:90%
And have a great day.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.628 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:31.628 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Kristen Morrison.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Country Victoria.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.930 align:middle line:84%
I've always been a huge advocate
of natural therapies and home

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.430 align:middle line:84%
birthing and all
that kind of stuff.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And we had two beautifully
healthy daughters

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:90%
both born at home.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2006, our son
was born, also at home.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:90%
I was 38 at the time.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the
usual intrusive testing

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:84%
that you might have being a bit
older going into a pregnancy.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, we were absolutely
gobsmacked to discover

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.808 align:middle line:84%
that after he was born in this
beautiful peaceful home birth.

00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:84%
We were shocked to discover
he had Down syndrome.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, initially, immediately
after birth, I looked at him.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell from his eyes
that he had Down syndrome.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to wait until my
midwife told me that it was so.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't tell anyone.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even tell my husband.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.953 align:middle line:90%
And it was actually--

00:02:30.953 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't even remember--
a couple of days

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.695 align:middle line:84%
before I mentioned
to my midwife.

00:02:34.695 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:84%
For a moment there, I
thought he had Down syndrome.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, no,
I think he'll be OK.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
But I was going through all
this internal, it's not right.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:90%
He's quiet.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.997 align:middle line:90%
He's not crying.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Why is he not responding the
way that our daughters did?

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
There was just something
not quite right.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until we went
into the most horrible,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:90%
horrifying testing phase.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
He'd had this beautiful,
peaceful birth that was--

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:84%
actually, I was laughing in
labor, it was so beautiful.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when we decided
that it was pretty likely

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:84%
that he did have Down syndrome,
we had to do the testing.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And we had to squeeze his little
foot to get enough blood out

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do
the genetic testing.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.295 align:middle line:84%
And then that came
back inconclusive.

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:17.420 align:middle line:90%
And we had to do it again.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So it was actually a whole week
between holding him in my arms

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.492 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, I think
that's what it is,

00:03:23.492 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:90%
and then having it confirmed.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:90%
It was torture.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like suppressed grief,
because I couldn't really

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:84%
embrace it that
that's what it was.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.497 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of
hoping that wasn't.

00:03:33.497 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:90%
So it was very weird week.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.416 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:40.090 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:84%
My husband was equally
as grief-stricken

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:84%
as I was, probably
me a little more so,

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:90%
because I was hormonal as well.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:90%
So I was sister blubbering mess.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And my husband was
just in shock, really.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And within a couple
of days, my mother

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:90%
had started researching online.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:84%
My midwife was
looking into things.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I then started to do
some of my own research.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And we as a couple
decided that we

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
were going to keep
it to ourselves

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and try and just
work out how the hell

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
we deal with this situation
privately before we went public

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.160 align:middle line:84%
When the day that the
diagnosis was confirmed,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.223 align:middle line:90%
it was actually a Friday.

00:04:22.223 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And our daughters
came home from school.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And we decided, OK, we'll
tell them what's happened.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And we'll give them the whole
weekend to grieve and discuss.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we brought the
kids home from school.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:90%
And I was a mess.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And I told them, you
know, eight and nine.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, we're just devastated,
but your little brother

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:90%
has Down syndrome.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at each
other and looked at us.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, oh, so what?

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:90%
He's still our little brother.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was even more
emotional with that,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:84%
because they were kind of saying
to me, what's the big deal.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Why are you
concerned about that?

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:90%
We're not.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.110 align:middle line:90%
As their initial reaction.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the next question
was, what's for dinner.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So Joseph and I just had
to really look at ourselves

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
and go, OK, well,
are we making this

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
a whole big deal
when maybe it's not.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very
pivotal experience for us.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.095 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:19.095 --> 00:05:22.042 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:90%
I went to the medical doctor.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:84%
We went to a family GP who'd
sort of supervised our births.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'll go and
tell him what's going on.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And he'll hand me a brochure
and say go and see this clinic.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've kind of thought I'd be
ferried in the right direction

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.403 align:middle line:84%
to get the kind of help that
suited my lifestyle choices.

00:05:39.403 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But instead, he just said,
I don't know what to say.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.007 align:middle line:84%
I actually really
don't know what

00:05:46.007 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I can do to help you
except to introduce you

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:84%
to some other patients of ours
who have an adult son with Down

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:90%
syndrome.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.083 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can speak to them
about what it's like to have

00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:90%
an adult child with Down's.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:90%
But it was a hopeless situation.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I realized at
that moment I was

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.560 align:middle line:84%
going to have to-- because
I really pigheadedly

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:84%
believed I could make
a difference, right

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.100 align:middle line:90%
from the start.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I'm not going
to let this actually ruin

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:90%
my life, my family's life.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, fortunately, had
a very deeply spiritual view

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:90%
of the whole thing.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.227 align:middle line:90%
And she took me aside.

00:06:20.227 --> 00:06:23.133 align:middle line:84%
And she said, OK, you have
to change your attitude.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back to
when you were pregnant.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.133 align:middle line:84%
And you have to imagine
all those hopes and dreams

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:30.290 align:middle line:84%
you had for the son that
you'd always hoped to have.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.223 align:middle line:84%
And just don't change
that keep those dreams.

00:06:32.223 --> 00:06:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And just keep putting
it there that he's going

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:90%
to have an extraordinary life.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So I luckily, with
that bit of advice,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I brainwashed
myself into thinking

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:84%
that it wasn't such a big
deal, just like my daughters

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:90%
have been telling us.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.132 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:48.132 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, because I
really, my whole life, I'd

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:84%
only ever seen a couple of
people with Down syndrome.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.128 align:middle line:84%
And I used to have
a fashion store.

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And so one day, a mom bought
her young son into the store.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was very much the typical
young man with Down syndrome.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.370 align:middle line:90%
And I was terrified.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I was terrified
by that potential

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:84%
that I might become that
woman in her middle years,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
having to care for
and escort someone

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:90%
through their own lives.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I was frightened by that
prospect for myself.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.800 align:middle line:84%
I was frightened by that
prospect for any of my children

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:90%
to have to be so dependent.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So I really had to stare
down the barrel of, OK,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:84%
am I going to be really,
really courageous

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and believe what my mom
says, that I should just

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
keep my dreams alive for him
and just shoot for the stars?

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.035 align:middle line:84%
Or am I going to just take what
the mainstream professionals

00:07:52.035 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:84%
are telling me, that
it's basically you

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:90%
can't do anything.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:90%
You just have to watch.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.645 align:middle line:84%
You just have to wait
and see how severe it is.

00:07:57.645 --> 00:07:58.445 align:middle line:90%
It could be this.

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:90%
It could be this.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:84%
In the research I was doing,
I started to make a list.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.105 align:middle line:84%
And there was a list
that's in my book that's

00:08:05.105 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
a couple of pages long of
potential characteristics

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.440 align:middle line:90%
of a child with Down syndrome.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're everything from the
typical flat facial profile,

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
no nasal bridge, all these kinds
of superficial facial features

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:84%
but then difficulty with
speech, thinning hair,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:84%
bad skin problems,
respiratory problems.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept
making this list,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.770 align:middle line:84%
because I thought, if I look
at each of those symptoms

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.559 align:middle line:84%
and try and prevent them
from even presenting,

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.419 align:middle line:90%
maybe I can make a difference.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And the first evidence I had
that I could make a difference

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:90%
was that--

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I think it would have been
the first week of his life.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I started massaging
him with flaxseed oil.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And that was to get
omega-3s into his body.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't believe it.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.447 align:middle line:84%
His skin was flaky and
dry when he was born.

00:08:56.447 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:84%
That's probably common
to a lot of children.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:90%
But we do that every day.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And I later realized that
that's sensory input.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't just the oil.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.740 align:middle line:84%
It was also all the
massage and the really

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:90%
hands-on sensory stuff.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So after I did that and started
to notice that his skin was

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
pinker and looking
healthier, I thought, well,

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:90%
that's a pretty simple example.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But that's something that
I can do to prevent him

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:90%
from having the skin problems.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.140 align:middle line:84%
He had nappy rash once
his whole early childhood.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So I just decided
to be encouraged

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
by those signs of
making a difference

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and just used them
to feed myself

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.270 align:middle line:90%
to go onto the next thing.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.625 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:42.625 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so in amongst
these horror stories

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.520 align:middle line:84%
of kids who had heart
problems and all manner

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:84%
of medical complications
and social problems

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of
it, there was actually

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
a story that I heard
about a young girl who

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.955 align:middle line:84%
had been given a glyconutrient
product, which is a cell food

00:10:03.955 --> 00:10:04.755 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:10:04.755 --> 00:10:07.270 align:middle line:84%
It boosts communication
between the cells.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.017 align:middle line:84%
And so what little
bit I read about it,

00:10:09.017 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, I should
just order the book.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.017 align:middle line:84%
And I should maybe get some
of these glyconutrients.

00:10:13.017 --> 00:10:15.067 align:middle line:90%
This was very, very early days.

00:10:15.067 --> 00:10:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was sent this
book that was just

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:84%
a thin, little, self-published
booklet with this picture

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:84%
on the front of basically
some before and after photos

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.718 align:middle line:90%
of this child's face.

00:10:24.718 --> 00:10:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a two-dimensional--
there's no video.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:84%
This is just how this
child's appearance

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:84%
changed over a period of
time on glyconutrients.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.797 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was one
photo, so I didn't

00:10:34.797 --> 00:10:35.880 align:middle line:90%
see a whole bunch of them.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
But just one photo
showed a young girl

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:84%
who did not look like
she had Down syndrome.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, well,
that goes on the list.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And then there
were other stories.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.685 align:middle line:84%
I read about the impact of
osteopathy on these kids.

00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:54.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty common thing
for a child with Down syndrome

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.377 align:middle line:84%
to have a very flat
facial profile.

00:10:56.377 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts
of reasons for that.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But with osteo and
cranial work, you

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:84%
can actually begin to bring
the eyebrows out and bring

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:90%
the nasal bridge out.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I learned was
that it's not just cosmetic.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.360 align:middle line:84%
You want to help that little
baby's nasal bridge to come

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.953 align:middle line:84%
out, because it's basically
like standing on a hose.

00:11:15.953 --> 00:11:17.370 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a
flat nasal bridge,

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:84%
it's like standing on a
hose and preventing oxygen

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.850 align:middle line:84%
from getting through
to the brain.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And it just made
perfect sense to me.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.645 align:middle line:90%
So we started to an osteo.

00:11:24.645 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And I realized also,
reading these stories

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:84%
about kids who'd had
aggressive osteopathy,

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
the difference in
their facial profile

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and therefore the difference to
their performance just in life.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I realized I really
need to document this,

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.775 align:middle line:84%
because I have
photos of Griffin.

00:11:39.775 --> 00:11:42.810 align:middle line:84%
You can see his facial
profile was very flat.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.420 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing between
the eyes, totally flat.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:84%
His eyebrows, he really
didn't have eyebrows.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.096 align:middle line:84%
So we started taking
him to see an osteo.

00:11:51.096 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And over time, there's a
series of photos in my book.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can see from
birth to age three,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:90%
that profile came out.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Those little epicanthal
folds, the fold

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.362 align:middle line:84%
which typically happens in
a child with Down syndrome

00:12:02.362 --> 00:12:03.820 align:middle line:84%
is because there's
no nasal bridge.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.210 align:middle line:90%
So all the skin just folds over.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So as the nasal bridge
grows, those folds go away.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So I started to see that, OK,
we have to chronicle this.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to do
this, maybe this

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.380 align:middle line:84%
could then become a road map
for other parents to follow.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And every time I took a
photo-- and oh, my god,

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:84%
it's like there's a couple
of millimeters there.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.135 align:middle line:84%
And that became
intoxicating to watch.

00:12:27.135 --> 00:12:29.218 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:29.218 --> 00:12:32.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.970 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty obvious to me.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.612 align:middle line:84%
I'd always been into
natural, healthy food anyway.

00:12:37.612 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:84%
But it was pretty
obvious to me from what

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I was reading that the less
exposure to toxins that you can

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:84%
give any child, the better, but
particularly a child with Down

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.600 align:middle line:84%
syndrome or some kind
of neurological problem.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:84%
The less pressure you
can put on the brain

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.917 align:middle line:84%
to have to process food
that's laced with pesticides

00:12:54.917 --> 00:12:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and chemicals and what
have you, the better.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I was reading about MSG and the
effect that that has on anyone.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I just thought, OK,
well, it's got to be organic.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:84%
He's got to have crazy
potent nutrition.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And I started him on
a supplement program

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.612 align:middle line:84%
starting off with
that glyconutrient.

00:13:11.612 --> 00:13:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of layered
other ones based on what

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:90%
we deemed his body wanted.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And the changes over time,
things like his muscle tone

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.318 align:middle line:84%
improved, obviously,
his skin improved.

00:13:24.318 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:90%
There were all sorts of things.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Even his alertness improved
just from nutrition.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:90%
And I guess that's where--

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.290 align:middle line:84%
When I first decided
to publish the book,

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted
to get the message

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.490 align:middle line:84%
across that this is
not just for kids

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:90%
with neurological problems.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.300 align:middle line:84%
If any child is given
a perfectly clean,

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
organic, chemical-free
diet, and if they're

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:84%
given as much
nutrition as possible,

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.607 align:middle line:84%
the brain is going
to grow optimally.

00:13:49.607 --> 00:13:50.940 align:middle line:90%
They're going to look healthier.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:90%
They're going to get sick less.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Kids who have got special needs
often get sick more often,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
which means that in itself can
delay them developmentally,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
crawling when they could be,

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:84%
because they're
recovering from something.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:90%
So it's really just a whole--

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I had so many epiphanies
along the way,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:84%
because I really realized
that, oh, my god.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Organic food is not just a trend
or something like a bandwagon

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.455 align:middle line:90%
you should actually jump on.

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
lifestyle we should all

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:90%
be completely committed to.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.112 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so when Griffin
was 10 months old,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.858 align:middle line:84%
we'd already done an enormous
amount of work with him.

00:14:30.858 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:90%
I just want to backtrack a bit.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we did
was Griff was called NAET.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So this is a fusion of
acupuncture and kinesiology.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And I have personally had
a lot of NAET treatments,

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:84%
because I had some
dietary problems.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I had some allergies that
I wanted to deal with.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:90%
And I learned about NAET.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it
basically identifies,

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:90%
through muscle testing.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.020 align:middle line:84%
It identifies
blockages in the body.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And that can be blockages
to supplements, foodstuffs.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:84%
That can be blockages, like
basically energy blockages

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:84%
from the brain to organs and
muscles and what have you.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So once I'd gotten my confidence
about the various different

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:84%
things that I was
doing with him,

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
my naturopath suggested we
should start doing some NAET

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:84%
to help him to better
absorb the foods that I

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:90%
was able to get into him.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And the thing with the NAET
was that we noticed changes

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:90%
overnight.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.840 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a
whole autism protocol

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:84%
where you can target parts of
the brain, the communication

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.250 align:middle line:90%
throughout the brain and body.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And the first treatment
that we gave him

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:84%
on this autism
protocol was actually

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.800 align:middle line:84%
to basically switch
on the brain.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And he went from
lying in the cot, sort

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:90%
of movements like this.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.040 align:middle line:84%
The day after, he had
this first treatment,

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.520 align:middle line:84%
he started to do this
with his fingers.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:84%
You can't deny that that
is what caused that.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.315 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to
embrace NAET 100%.

00:15:54.315 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:84%
We did an enormous
amount of work

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.135 align:middle line:84%
on foods, vitamins, specific
vitamins, things like egg,

00:15:59.135 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:90%
dairy, what have you.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
We just gave him as much
support with that as we could.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.002 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to
do my own research,

00:16:05.002 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:84%
because I thought,
OK, well, if you

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:84%
can target parts of
the brain with this

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and switch on parts of the
brain which were perhaps,

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:84%
in some ways, not working
properly before, maybe we

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.980 align:middle line:84%
can target other parts
of the body as well.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:90%
So I researched.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Griffin's tongue hung out.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And he had the typical sort
of what is often described

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:25.870 align:middle line:90%
as an enlarged tongue.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's just basically
not doing anything.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And he had the downturned
sides of the mouth.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And the lips were kind of
not as responsive or muscly

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.600 align:middle line:90%
as they should be.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So I did a lot of research
into the mouth, the lips,

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:84%
the tongue, all the different
muscles, nerves, and ligaments

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.663 align:middle line:90%
around this area.

00:16:44.663 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And I went back to
my NAET practitioner.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.213 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, so there's
an autism protocol.

00:16:48.213 --> 00:16:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we could develop a
protocol for Down syndrome,

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:84%
because this is obviously a
common problem that they have.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:90%
So we muscle tested.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.928 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, he
was very weak too

00:16:56.928 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:84%
in the areas of all of
these muscles and tendons.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And we treated him.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, his
tongue stopped hanging out.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:84%
By the time he was two, the
only times his tongue hung out

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:90%
were if he was super tired.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And he had this beautifully
shaped little mouth-- like,

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:84%
his father's family got a very
crinkle-cut sort of mouth.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.240 align:middle line:84%
All those muscles started
to work the way they should,

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
where before it had been kind
of a bit sort of shapeless

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:90%
and without tone.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So he was already doing
extraordinarily well

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.940 align:middle line:90%
by the time he was 10 months.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling fabulous.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
little piece missing.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
to do to specifically

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.920 align:middle line:84%
help him physically,
to specifically

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:90%
help him intellectually.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And for example, he
wouldn't crawl forward.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:84%
So he'd get from A to
B by rolling this way,

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:84%
rolling that way,
rolling that way.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I found
out about the Institutes

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:84%
for the Achievement
of Human Potential.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And what they proposed was
that you can take any child,

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:84%
whether it's autism,
Down syndrome,

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.845 align:middle line:84%
any child that has any kind
of neurological compromise.

00:17:57.845 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can put them
on a program which

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.130 align:middle line:84%
helps them to move
more symmetrically,

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.430 align:middle line:84%
move appropriately, that sort of
switches on parts of the brain

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:90%
to help them to learn better.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And we started to do
some work with him

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.400 align:middle line:84%
straight away, just
from reading the book.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So I could not get enough
of this information

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:84%
when I found it, because
it was just full of hope.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And we started to do a program
at home, noticed some changes.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, within about
six weeks, my husband

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.490 align:middle line:84%
was able to go and do the
course in Philadelphia, which

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.890 align:middle line:84%
is a course we now bring to
Australia for special needs

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:90%
parents.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And when he came home
from that course,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.418 align:middle line:84%
he was completely
on the same page.

00:18:35.418 --> 00:18:37.210 align:middle line:84%
He'd been traveling a
lot and hadn't really

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:84%
been on the journey
the way that I had.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But when he came home,
he was crying with joy,

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.330 align:middle line:84%
because it was like, the
sky's the limit for our son.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
They have adult graduates
of their program

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:90%
with Down syndrome who--

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:90%
I met one.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:84%
He's an executive at IBM,
like real people out there

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.990 align:middle line:84%
in the community, doing
extraordinary things,

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:90%
defying the diagnosis.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.165 align:middle line:90%
So that was like, OK, done deal.

00:19:04.165 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like the last
piece of the puzzle.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.215 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a lot of
very good fortune with Griffin

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
in the timing of all
this, because I found out

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.750 align:middle line:84%
about the Institutes before
he'd started walking.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the more I got to wrap
my head around this technique,

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.090 align:middle line:84%
the more I realized I should
not encourage him to walk.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.632 align:middle line:84%
The instinct in a young child
is to get them up on their feet

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:28.757 align:middle line:84%
and get them holding your
hands and trying to walk.

00:19:28.757 --> 00:19:30.132 align:middle line:84%
But I realized
that that actually

00:19:30.132 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:90%
was not going to help him.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:84%
He needed to do as much
crawling and commando

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.950 align:middle line:90%
crawling as he possibly could.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So initially, his program
was a reading program,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.962 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially
visual stimulation.

00:19:39.962 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So we were just
presenting him with a lot

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.430 align:middle line:90%
of words on big cards.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:84%
We did an enormous amount of
crawling around the house.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was most of it
really going back then.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:84%
We started to layer on more
things as he got older.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But the things that
we started to notice

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.570 align:middle line:84%
within just a
couple of months, he

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.660 align:middle line:84%
started to crawl straight
ahead in a straight line.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So by the time he
was 14 months, he

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.563 align:middle line:84%
indicated that he
could recognize words.

00:20:12.563 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So we presented him with a
couple of different words

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:90%
on big cards.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'd ask him--

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:90%
I'd sort of say a word.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.950 align:middle line:90%
And he'd point to it.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And OK, getting
babies to read might

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
seem bizarre and
impossible, but it works.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And for little children
with a compromise,

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.187 align:middle line:84%
that's really
zeroing in on a part

00:20:31.187 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
of the brain which perhaps
wouldn't get stimulated

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:90%
until they went to school.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So the more you can
stimulate, the more

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.040 align:middle line:90%
they start to switch on.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And I understood that every
time you presented a little baby

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:84%
with a card with
a big word on it,

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
they're using
their visual reflex

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.720 align:middle line:84%
where perhaps in ordinary
course of the day for a baby,

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.930 align:middle line:84%
they don't need to use their
vision reflex in that way.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So you're really
helping to build

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:84%
pathways which normally they
wouldn't have an opportunity

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:90%
to build.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.925 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:84%
The book came about, because
I met a family in Israel,

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.347 align:middle line:84%
or a friend of mine introduced
me to her sister in Israel

00:21:09.347 --> 00:21:11.680 align:middle line:84%
and said my sister's just had
a baby with Down syndrome.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.470 align:middle line:90%
How do we help her?

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of decided I
wanted to write a book anyway.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So I went away to
Queensland for three days.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I took every email, every
text message, every note,

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:23.750 align:middle line:90%
my diaries.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I took everything and
just compiled into a book.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
cathartic, fantastic,

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary experience
to me to immerse myself

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:84%
in, oh, my god, look what
we've just done, like, really.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So then I obviously gave a
copy to this family in Israel.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But I also decided I wanted
to write it from a layperson's

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:90%
point of view.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to write it
from the point of view

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:84%
of any parent who might
have a kid with one

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:90%
of these problems on the list.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So it was really, not
simplistic English.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But it was presented in a way
that was easily understood.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:90%
So I published the book.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.570 align:middle line:90%
And I put it up on a website.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.857 align:middle line:84%
And I, all of a sudden,
started getting people.

00:21:59.857 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:90%
It was just an e-book initially.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:84%
But I started to sell it in
lots of different countries

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:84%
It's been sold in
30 countries now.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I started to get emails
from parents saying, look,

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.790 align:middle line:84%
my son doesn't even
have Down syndrome.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:84%
He's got some
developmental delay.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
doing this and this.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.377 align:middle line:90%
And I've noticed that.

00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And how do I get access
to the supplements?

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I
found myself running

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.490 align:middle line:84%
a kind of a support group
for people pretty quickly.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But I was also excited that
my husband's uncle, who's

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
a bit of a cowboy, lives in the
country, a man in his late 50s

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.960 align:middle line:90%
now, I guess.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:84%
He read my book, loved
it, and would then

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:84%
take it to the
supermarket with him,

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.777 align:middle line:84%
because he wanted to
look back at all the food

00:22:39.777 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:84%
chemicals I'd listed as
being things to avoid.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I just love the
idea of a grown cowboy

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:84%
walking around the supermarket
in the country with my book.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it really
touched hearts,

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:90%
resonated in a lot of people.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of, yes, certainly
people in the bonus community

00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:01.590 align:middle line:84%
who loved it but also people
who had red food coloring

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.940 align:middle line:90%
items in their fridges.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
They sort of started messaging
me to say, I read your book.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And I have just gone
through my pantry

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and thrown out so much stuff,
thrown out all the cleaners

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
that had bad products
in them and really tried

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
to embrace this sort
of low-tox lifestyle.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So it was just exciting
to think, well,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.937 align:middle line:84%
our little story can
actually help people

00:23:21.937 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:90%
in lots of different ways.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.400 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:84%
No, well, I got to
about the age of--

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:84%
by the time Griffin was five,
I really reached burnout.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:90%
And my doctor-- I was not well.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And my doctor took me
aside and said, OK, you've

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:90%
given Griffin all this time.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.410 align:middle line:90%
You need to go paleo.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.210 align:middle line:90%
You need to clean your diet up.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Yes, he gets all
the organic food.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:90%
But now you need it too.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And I really went home the
family said, OK, well, I'm

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:90%
sick.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:90%
I've got to fix myself.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And I decided, because I've
got a retail background,

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.650 align:middle line:90%
I can't stop being into retail.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.930 align:middle line:84%
I decided I need to set up
some kind of organic co-op

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.888 align:middle line:84%
or something, just to
help people to get access

00:24:02.888 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
to food, because it's not cheap
to feed a family of three,

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:90%
let alone five.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we set up the
Street Organics business.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And that became something I
was massively passionate about.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And at around the same time, I
met somebody, my friend Sarah,

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:84%
who read my book and was
so deeply moved by it.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to help
us in some way.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.252 align:middle line:84%
So we set up a
foundation, which really,

00:24:27.252 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:84%
the intention of
the foundation was

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.800 align:middle line:84%
to help parents who want to
follow the path that we've

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:84%
taken financially,
because it's expensive.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of these things you need to
do many, many, many treatments

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.328 align:middle line:90%
to get the results.

00:24:40.328 --> 00:24:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted parents to be able
to run their own fundraising

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
to be able to support
them through what

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.866 align:middle line:90%
could be a long process.

00:24:46.866 --> 00:24:48.324 align:middle line:84%
So that's how Grow
Foundation grew.

00:24:48.324 --> 00:24:49.746 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:49.746 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:84%
It's going through a little
bit of a transformation phase

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But for the last
four years, we've

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.070 align:middle line:84%
been actually bringing
the Institutes

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.195 align:middle line:84%
for the Achievement of
Human Potential to Australia

00:25:02.195 --> 00:25:03.830 align:middle line:90%
to train Australian parents.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.680 align:middle line:84%
We get parents from New
Zealand and Malaysia

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:90%
and other parts of Asia as well.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So really, that was the
most significant thing

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.180 align:middle line:84%
we could do initially
was to bring them here

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.630 align:middle line:84%
so that they can train parents
in the initial course and then

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.682 align:middle line:84%
the follow-on courses, because
it can cost a lot for a family

00:25:20.682 --> 00:25:22.640 align:middle line:84%
to travel to Philadelphia
or Singapore or Italy

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.560 align:middle line:90%
to get this information.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So we're sort of looking at ways
going forward that we can help,

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.110 align:middle line:84%
through our own
fundraising activities.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Melbourne marathon's
something that we do.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Griffin's actually going in
to run his third Melbourne

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.740 align:middle line:84%
marathon, just the 5Ks, to help
raise funds to help families.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's great.

You won.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Griffin, we decided to put
Griffin into mainstream school,

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:84%
because by the time
he was six, I really

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:90%
felt like he needed friends.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.430 align:middle line:84%
He'd been at home with
us the whole time.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So we put him into
mainstream school.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was a risk.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.210 align:middle line:90%
But he's made a lot of friends.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.650 align:middle line:84%
He's integrated
into the community.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.090 align:middle line:90%
He loves going to school.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:84%
He goes to just a regular
gymnastics class as well.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:84%
He's incredibly
healthy and active.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And really, he has a
pretty normal life.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We are about to embark on the
next phase of his program,

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.050 align:middle line:84%
because we really want to just
finish off what we've started.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.635 align:middle line:90%
But look, life's fantastic.

00:27:00.635 --> 00:27:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm thrilled that he's
achieved what he's achieved.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.170 align:middle line:90%
There are other children now.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.878 align:middle line:84%
I get more and more reports from
parents who have read my book.

00:27:06.878 --> 00:27:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they go off
and start doing stuff.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And they send me
success stories.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.273 align:middle line:84%
The urge to compare
is a dangerous one.

00:27:14.273 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:84%
But there are so
many stories that

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:84%
come in from kids who
have done similar work

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.853 align:middle line:84%
and who have had very
similar experiences.

00:27:20.853 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:84%
It depends a little bit
on the parents' focus.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Some parents really zero
in on the intellectual side

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:25.920 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Some parents really
zero in on the physical.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.560 align:middle line:84%
The parents who actually take
it and run with the whole thing

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.620 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who are
getting the best results.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
balance that with what's

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.100 align:middle line:84%
realistic for your
family and other kids.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.600 align:middle line:90%
And life kicks in.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.838 align:middle line:90%
And you know--

00:27:40.838 --> 00:27:42.774 align:middle line:90%

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:52.345 align:middle line:84%
Well, self-trust, being
arrogant enough to go,

00:27:52.345 --> 00:27:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what my
pediatrician said.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.387 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
the doctor said.

00:27:55.387 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make a
difference and back at 100%.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And then seeing that I was
right was massive for me.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And now, having other
parents read what we did

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and go and do it and get similar
results is massive for me.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.430 align:middle line:84%
It's incredibly humbling
for a layperson.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I've got no background in
medicine or even naturopathy.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I just read stuff and apply it.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.818 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
very empowering.

00:28:21.818 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It's really a time when
people can actually

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.805 align:middle line:84%
take responsibility
for their own health.

00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And especially
with the internet,

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.060 align:middle line:84%
you can access whatever
information you want.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's been incredibly--

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it has been a
spiritual process.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you
really allow yourself

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to disagree with the
diagnoses and forecasts

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.410 align:middle line:84%
that you're presented
with and just do

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.343 align:middle line:84%
what you think
resonates for you,

00:28:52.343 --> 00:28:53.510 align:middle line:90%
that's incredibly rewarding.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I read a couple of years ago
a speech by an American man

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.700 align:middle line:84%
who has a child
with Down syndrome.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote this
amazing presentation.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And the whole message
was expect, don't accept.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's true for
all of us in our lives, really.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And it really, for me,
that just resonated

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:84%
with what my mom had
said about, do not

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.160 align:middle line:84%
accept what you've
been told here.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't change your expectations.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:33.235 align:middle line:90%
Just shoot for that anyway.

00:29:33.235 --> 00:29:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a message
in that for all of us.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.120 align:middle line:90%


00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:84%
The only other thing, I
suppose, is that every child

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.450 align:middle line:90%
has their own journey too.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about a parent
presenting a child with what

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.060 align:middle line:90%
they want for their lives.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.898 align:middle line:90%
The kid has got to be on board.

00:29:54.898 --> 00:29:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's a bit
hard for some people

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.565 align:middle line:90%
to wrap their heads around.

00:29:57.565 --> 00:30:00.660 align:middle line:84%
But Griffin, I reckon he's
turned up with an agenda.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.220 align:middle line:84%
I seriously think-- I sometimes
have felt like I was just

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.110 align:middle line:90%
a pawn in his game.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like he just arrived
with this wellness message.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.277 align:middle line:84%
And he just wanted
to help people.

00:30:09.277 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And so everything that's
happened around him

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.110 align:middle line:84%
has happened to
facilitate that message.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.270 align:middle line:90%
So go Griff.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.198 align:middle line:90%

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I want Griffin to be an
independent man who's

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.600 align:middle line:90%
happy with his life.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And if that means he goes
to university, great.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.870 align:middle line:84%
If that means he wants
to be a raw chef, great.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:32.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't really care.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But I want him to have fulfilled
his own dreams for himself.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.160 align:middle line:90%
And I want to know that--

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's already played
out in the first six years.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.940 align:middle line:84%
But I want to know that
our message has actually

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.470 align:middle line:84%
impinged on people
enough for them

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:49.190 align:middle line:84%
to take control of their own
wellness and just not give up,

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.990 align:middle line:90%
really.
