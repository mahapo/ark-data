00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:26.310 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:84%
It's James C. from
"Food Matters."

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to this
special interview on FMTV

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:90%
with Joe Cross.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Joe, I'm lucky to call
a friend of mine now.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:90%
He's a fellow Aussie.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
He's featured in one of our
films, "Hungry for Change."

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And he's also the star of his
own film, "Fat, Sick & Nearly

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Dead," which is a must watch.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first time I saw
it, I just cried like a baby,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:90%
especially at the end scene.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.760 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't seen
it yet, check it out.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.560 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:84%
He's also gone on to do
other films, books, be

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.342 align:middle line:84%
the face of these
amazing events worldwide.

00:00:54.342 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And Joe, it's a pleasure to
be chatting to you, mate.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, James.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.088 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here, mate.

00:00:58.088 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe, for those people that
haven't seen your films "Fat,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:84%
Sick & Nearly Dead," "Fat,
Sick and Nearly Dead 2,"

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and "The Kids Menu," tell us
a little bit about this story

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.620 align:middle line:84%
of yours and how you ended up
being a filmmaker and a bit

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:84%
of a celebrity in this
health and wellness space.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, James, "Fat,
Sick, & Nearly Dead"

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.910 align:middle line:84%
one really is my personal
story, going from being broken,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:84%
being fat, being sick,
being nearly dead,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to trying to get
myself back on track,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.500 align:middle line:84%
to get off medication and
just get my life back,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:90%
my happiness back.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's that story.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
That movie released in 2011,
has been seen by around 25

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.920 align:middle line:90%
million people worldwide.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And it just continues everyday
to change people's lives,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
influence them in
a positive way.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.787 align:middle line:84%
Around 2014, we decided to
go out and try and continue

00:01:44.787 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:84%
the story on with
"Fat, Sick, & Nearly

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Dead 2," which effectively,
I wanted to go and meet

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.310 align:middle line:84%
some of the people that the
movie had affected and changed

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.053 align:middle line:84%
their lives as well as give
an update to where I was at

00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:90%
and where I was going.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's "Fat, Sick
& Nearly Dead 2."

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.552 align:middle line:90%
And that was fun to make.

00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:90%
And we're all over the world.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:84%
We're in Europe, we're in
Africa, we're in Australia.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:90%
It had this global phenomenon.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So that was really
cool and exciting.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.007 align:middle line:84%
Then "The Kids Menu"
really was-- every time

00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I was out giving
talks, James, and I'm

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
sure you get this, as well,
I got lots of parents saying,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Joe, what about the kids?

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.352 align:middle line:90%
What about the next generation?

00:02:18.352 --> 00:02:20.420 align:middle line:90%
What can we do for the kids?

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it seemed to
me that this question

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:84%
kept coming up more and
more and more and more.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.358 align:middle line:90%
So I said to my team--

00:02:27.358 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, I think
our third film, which

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
is going to be necessarily
off Joe, not about my story,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:84%
just focusing on what's
a really important story,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
next generation--

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
how can we inspire, educate,
entertain and inform kids?

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I meant by kids--
kids to me is 0 to 21.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the focus
of this new film

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.830 align:middle line:84%
of mine, "The Kids Menu," which
has been out about 12 months

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.220 align:middle line:84%
It's only on Netflix,
unfortunately.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
I would love it to be
on Food Matters TV,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:90%
but Netflix took an exclusive.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So a couple of years, it'll
definitely be on your network.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>> But this was the impetus
behind the third film.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:90%
What about the kids?

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.800 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a great film.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I was lucky to see a copy just
before it went out on Netflix.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, mate.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good stuff.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we're very proud of it.

00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Good stuff.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.990 align:middle line:90%
Why juice at the beginning?

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.705 align:middle line:84%
This catalyst for you,
transforming your health

00:03:23.705 --> 00:03:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and the "Fat, Sick &
Nearly Dead" film, which

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.978 align:middle line:90%
was just so transformative--

00:03:27.978 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I know when people watch
it, they're so inspired.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But what was it about
juice in particular

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
that made you decide to
use that as a particular--

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> So I got to juice via plants.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
The original concept was,
OK, I'm fat and I'm sick.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:90%
I need to fix this.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I'll take
the sick one first.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And my turning my back on
Mother Nature, saying to her,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:90%
look, I'll be fine--

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go down
this processed route

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:90%
and catch you later.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
You cannot ignore the biological
laws of cause and effect.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.490 align:middle line:84%
You go and do that, you
will break eventually.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.140 align:middle line:90%
I broke at age 32.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
believe that I broke.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm a rugby player.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm strong.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:90%
I've always been fit.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And here I am taking meds
every day, every lunchtime,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:90%
every evening.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor's
saying, Joe, you're

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.112 align:middle line:84%
going to be on this
for all your life.

00:04:23.112 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I
don't think so, pal.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But then eight years later,
I'm still taking them.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.140 align:middle line:90%
And this was a disease of touch.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:90%
This was a bad illness.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's called chronic
urticaria angioedema.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:84%
It's fancy way of
saying chronic hives.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you and I shook
hands and you shook my hand

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
just a normal
tight grip, my hand

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.670 align:middle line:84%
could swell up as though it
had been jammed in a car door.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of pain
that I would go through

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
from any physical pressure,
any touch on my body.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:90%
So it was a big issue.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So when I decided to
consume only plant food,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
to switch away from this
standard American diet

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
that I was consuming,
high processed

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:84%
foods, high refined
sugars, carbohydrates,

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.610 align:middle line:84%
lots of takeaway,
lots of alcohol,

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.110 align:middle line:84%
smoking, no exercise,
this major stress,

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:90%
all of these lifestyle choices--

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
when I decided to clean
house, the idea of plants

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:90%
just made sense.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just logical.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Go back to what made us
the most successful species

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.360 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, Mother
Nature, that partnership.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:90%
So that was the sick part.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But now when you go to
the fat part, James,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:84%
why was I carrying around an
extra 100 pounds or an extra 40

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:90%
kilos of fat?

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:90%
What was the purpose of it?

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you go back
and look at this,

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:84%
you realize it's just
stored up energy.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.915 align:middle line:84%
People walk around saying,
oh, how fat that person,

00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
look at how fat--
they're not fat.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
They're just people carrying
all this extra energy.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And their body is waiting
for that moment in time

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.990 align:middle line:84%
when there's no energy consumed
so that energy can be used.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, wow,
this is an aha moment here.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:90%
I need to not eat.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I need to go back to
what my ancestors did,

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.220 align:middle line:84%
which is pretend that
there's a famine.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
We've gone through
feast and famine.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
history of our humanity.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And I have forgotten
how to famine.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:90%
So then I had this big problem.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, don't eat
and eat lots of plants.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.180 align:middle line:90%
I've got a problem.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I've got these two great
ideas, but they're not

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:90%
coming together.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:90%
And then it hit me.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:90%
What is juicing?

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Juicing is extracting
the water from plants.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not mashing up a
plant like a blender does.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
It's actually stripping
out all of the water that

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:90%
is harnessed in plants.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you put salary or
cucumber or an apple or kale

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:90%
or a pear or ginger--

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:84%
when you put that
through a juicer,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:90%
that's extracting the water out.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing is it comes
in a colorful way, either red,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:84%
purple, green,
yellow, or orange.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
You have five primary
colors of sunlight

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:90%
that's harnessed in plants.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And that color is where
all those nutrients live,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
these micronutrients,
these minerals,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.650 align:middle line:84%
these chemicals that
are absolutely critical

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:84%
for our cell not only function,
but production and longevity.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think about
really what juice is,

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:90%
it's the true Vitamin Water.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.510 align:middle line:90%
It's the true mineral water.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:90%
It's the true nutrient water.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's not eating, which
gave me that bit of leeway

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to create
by the famine idea.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.837 align:middle line:84%
So I look at juice "fasting--"
and the word "fasting"

00:07:34.837 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:84%
is the wrong word to use
there, but everyone understands

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
what that means, because
fasting is zero calories, zero

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:90%
energy, zero nutrients.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%
But if we just give us a bit of
latitude and say juice fasting,

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.170 align:middle line:84%
it really means you
are not consuming

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:90%
any fiber that is insoluble.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:84%
You're only consuming
soluble fiber,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.220 align:middle line:84%
so fiber that can dissolve and
be so tiny it's in the water,

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:84%
but the stuff that is
the mechanism that plants

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:84%
have created to deliver
the nutrients to us.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
That fiber when you eat celery,
James, you actually pass out

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:90%
the fiber through your bowels.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't consume the fiber to
give you any nutrient benefit.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:90%
The nutrients are in the water.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.360 align:middle line:84%
They're trapped molecules
that are in the water that

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:90%
are in the celery plant itself.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.192 align:middle line:90%
So the idea of juice--

00:08:26.192 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I know I've given you
a long answer here.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But the idea for me is that it
was this beautiful combination

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and magic of getting
the nutrients I need

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.700 align:middle line:84%
from Mother Nature and providing
this, in inverted commas,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:90%
"fast."

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So I was tricking my
body into thinking

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't eating
when in actual fact,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I was flooding it
with micronutrients.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:90%
It's so fascinating, isn't it?

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Because we have
such a rich history

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:90%
as humans on this planet.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.180 align:middle line:90%
And we've gone through so much.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's only been
in recent times

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
that we have seen
processed foods,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.893 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen preserved
foods, preserved incorrectly.

00:09:02.893 --> 00:09:05.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about fermented
foods, properly fermented.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking incorrectly
preserved and salted foods.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's caused such
havoc on our bodies.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And it makes so much
sense to just go back

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.477 align:middle line:84%
towards these natural
processes of fasting.

00:09:15.477 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:84%
You talked about the
difference a little bit

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.727 align:middle line:84%
between juices and
smoothies here.

00:09:18.727 --> 00:09:19.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:09:19.527 --> 00:09:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, this is an
interesting conversation.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And everyone always asks me,
I'm sure they ask you everytime.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I get asked every day, social
media, maybe 10 times a day.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Juices versus smoothies.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Look, and there's
some obvious differences.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:84%
But do you love
one over the other?

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Do you turn to different ones
at different points in time?

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And what are your opinions
on one versus another?

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.592 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think the best
way to think about--

00:09:41.592 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:84%
let's think about what we're all
trying to do if we're serious

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:84%
about wanting to be happy and
be healthy and live longer

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and just be all around the
best person that we can be.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.720 align:middle line:84%
If we're serious about
that, then you've

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:84%
got to enter into a partnership
deal with Mother Nature.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.890 align:middle line:84%
You need to include Mother
Nature in your life.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
She needs to be with
you as much as possible.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are days when you can
not include her in your life.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:84%
But majority of the time, she's
got to be front and center.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's only
really three ways

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:84%
to consume the
incredible benefits that

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.060 align:middle line:84%
are found in micronutrients,
which are majority found

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
in plant food, fruits,
vegetables, nuts, beans, seeds,

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:90%
whole grains, whole foods.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is either using
your mouth to chew,

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.360 align:middle line:84%
either just using your
hands, a knife and fork,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:84%
whatever, using a blender,
which will effectively

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:84%
outsource the masticating,
the chewing-- you're

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:90%
outsourcing it to a machine.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.577 align:middle line:84%
So you're saving your teeth
and your jaw and the chewing.

00:10:48.577 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:90%
And you blend it up.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.868 align:middle line:84%
Now, generally to
do that, you need

00:10:50.868 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:90%
to put some liquid in there.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.267 align:middle line:84%
And most people put in a
juice, either an apple juice

00:10:56.267 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:90%
or a straight fruit juice.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84%
They put in a milk, a
nut milk, hopefully,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:84%
that's an almond or a cashew
or some kind of a milk.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.090 align:middle line:90%
They'll put in a coconut water.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
They'll put in some
kind of liquid.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So instantly, we are taking
the nutrient density--

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:19.460 align:middle line:84%
we're actually
deintensifying it.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
We're diluting it, which
is not a bad thing.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
But we just need to be aware
that when you put something in,

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:84%
you're diluting
the nutrient value.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And really, a smoothie is
really just consumption of food,

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.630 align:middle line:84%
but somebody else
or something else

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:84%
has chewed it for you, in
this case, the blender.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.273 align:middle line:84%
Juicing is like outsourcing
digestion to a machine.

00:11:45.273 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Not only are we
outsourcing the chewing,

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:84%
we're outsourcing the
function of digestion.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we're saying,
you know what?

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's let the blender separate
the fiber from the nutrients.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.070 align:middle line:90%
So we consume this water.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And when we drink the
water, this high density

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.780 align:middle line:84%
of micronutrients, we
get rapid absorption.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And the body doesn't really
go into this-- enzymes

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:84%
aren't generated to
break down the food.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
trick yourself

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:84%
into thinking you
didn't eat, which

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.173 align:middle line:84%
is why I don't ever recommend
juicing as a meal replacement

00:12:17.173 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to be
hungry because you didn't

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:90%
really feel satisfied.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.610 align:middle line:84%
You didn't fill up
your stomach, so

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:84%
to speak, as if you did a
blended smoothie or something.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Because you can feel quite full
if you do a blended smoothie.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But when you juice for a period
of time, over three days,

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that's when the hunger will turn
off, and then you'll feel full.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But in just normal everyday
consumption of our plants,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan, James,
of doing all three,

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:90%
juicing, blending, and chewing.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Well-answered.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:84%
So you've just come off the
back of a 30-day reboot.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.953 align:middle line:84%
>> And this would be maybe,
I don't know, I'm guessing--

00:12:53.953 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:84%
how many have you
done now since--

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is the longest
one I've done since I did the 60

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:90%
days way back in 2007.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.900 align:middle line:90%
So this is nine years later.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:08.330 align:middle line:84%
In the previous times, I've done
between 15, 18 days as long,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.280 align:middle line:90%
and 5 to 10 days.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And let's make sure we
define what a reboot is.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Because a reboot is not
necessarily a juice fast.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:84%
We talk about rebooting
as incorporating juicing,

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:84%
blending, and eating
plants, if someone

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:84%
wants to define their
reboot like that.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a time where we
focus only on plant food.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.610 align:middle line:84%
We do no animal product and
we do absolutely no processed

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:90%
food.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't bring anything
else into our system

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:90%
other than fruits and veggies.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.448 align:middle line:90%
We don't do nuts.

00:13:39.448 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:90%
We don't do those things.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.400 align:middle line:84%
We're just fruits
and veggies only.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:90%
So it's not even vegan.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:90%
It's more strict.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And majority of people
find that juicing them

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.848 align:middle line:84%
is much more beneficial in
the longer term for them

00:13:52.848 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:90%
because they just feel amazing.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
They feel great, like
jump out of their skin.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:90%
So for me, I do--

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I started off,
James, afterwards--

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
I was doing them every
three, four months.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I found it to be a little
bit monotonous early.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So I'm probably down to every
four months to five months,

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:90%
I do a reboot.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.550 align:middle line:90%
But this was something because--

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:84%
this was an opportunity,
being back in Australia,

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:90%
being focused.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:84%
'16 was a very tough,
stressful year.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot of things
that were moving and--

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I had partnerships
with companies

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:84%
that it was like next month,
next month, next month.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.903 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that time, even
though you're not really

00:14:33.903 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
doing anything, just
that waiting around

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:84%
can be stressful
because you don't

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
know about a certainty
of the future.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And I find that when stress
comes to me, things drop off.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Exercise falls away, choices--

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:90%
I live an 80-20 rule, James.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.360 align:middle line:84%
80% of the time, I
try to be really good.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
20% of the time, I just
relax and have a good time.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:84%
If we went to a baseball game,
a football game, a cricket game,

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.220 align:middle line:90%
whatever--

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat meat right now, but
if you wanted to have a pie,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.938 align:middle line:90%
I'll have a pie with you.

00:15:00.938 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't drink a beer, but
maybe I'll have a ginger ale.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:84%
That'd be my special
occasion thing.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.310 align:middle line:90%
So I try to do the 80-20 rule.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
happened to me in '16

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
is it probably went more 60-40
than 80-20 towards the back end

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
of the year.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.102 align:middle line:90%
So I recognized that.

00:15:16.102 --> 00:15:17.060 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel as good.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.102 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel as strong.

00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:90%
You're not as vibrant.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:84%
You're not thinking clear
or you're not sleeping well.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this can then
steam roll into other problems,

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:84%
not wanting to move, not
wanting to get a good night's

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:90%
sleep, worrying about things.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, it was just like
this little circuit breaker

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
that, wow, I've got this
month of January in 2017.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.177 align:middle line:84%
I'm really going to kick
this new year off in a way

00:15:38.177 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:84%
where I'm just going
to pay homage and bring

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Mother Nature back into
my life a little bit more.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:84%
You talked there about
having a tough year,

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:90%
it was emotionally tough.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Life is like that.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you bet.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And no one's immune from it.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:84%
What emotions or
emotional issues

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:84%
potentially come up
during a cleanse for you?

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Because when we talk about
cleansing and detoxification,

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.000 align:middle line:84%
we're typically talking
about tissue cleansing,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.630 align:middle line:84%
the biomechanical elements of
the body, eliminating toxins.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.505 align:middle line:84%
But then I know from
experience myself

00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and with a lot of people,
there are generally

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.297 align:middle line:90%
emotions that come up.

00:16:13.297 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:84%
How was this last
30 days for you?

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Was there things that you
felt you worked through?

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Was there emotions that came up?

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.005 align:middle line:90%
Or was it not really an issue?

00:16:21.005 --> 00:16:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no, definitely an issue.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a good question.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably a
part of the conversation

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:84%
that I talk the least
about, but probably has

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.550 align:middle line:90%
the most relevance.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm out on my
circuit either talking

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:84%
about a film or new book,
I always tell the story

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:84%
that I believe is going on
in Australia, in the UK,

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.900 align:middle line:84%
in America, in
Dubai, in Germany,

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
wherever, the Western
world, that I believe--

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and this is sad,
but I believe this,

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that over half the population
over the age of 35, James,

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
gets out of bed in the
morning, looks in the mirror,

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and looks there and says,
oh, my God, look at you.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.970 align:middle line:90%
You're a disaster.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:90%
You're a disgrace.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:90%
You're fat.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:90%
You're ugly.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.910 align:middle line:90%
You're a loser.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:90%
You're a no-hoper.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:84%
You're just the
worst of the worst.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:84%
This is the internal
conversation

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.530 align:middle line:84%
that they're having with
themselves the first thing

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.025 align:middle line:90%
in the morning every day.

00:17:21.025 --> 00:17:22.400 align:middle line:84%
I know people who
don't ever want

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:90%
to look in the mirror, James.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.720 align:middle line:84%
They're disgusted by
what they see back.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:84%
They had this vision of
where they were going to be,

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
nowhere near it.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.895 align:middle line:84%
So they start their day
off with this negativity.

00:17:34.895 --> 00:17:36.770 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to be
when you go and greet

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:84%
the wife or the husband
or the kids for breakfast?

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.410 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to be
after that little pep talk?

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just a shocking
way to start your day.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm no different.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:47.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm human.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:84%
When I'm having a tough time,
when I'm doing the 60-40

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:84%
or when I've had maybe 3
days of eating the crap food,

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I wake up thinking
the same thing.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Here's what happens
when you flood

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:84%
your system with this nutrition,
when you get this momentum--

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I talk a lot about
momentum, wind in your back,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.130 align:middle line:84%
wind full of your
sails, going forward.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:84%
You start giving yourself little
pats on the back, little wins.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Five days in, go, Joe.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Seven days in, you
got this, mate.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.020 align:middle line:84%
10 days in, we're a
third of the way there.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.772 align:middle line:84%
This positive, starting
to love yourself--

00:18:24.772 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not talking about love
yourself taking 100 selfies.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about love yourself
as, I am a good person.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:90%
I've got this.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:84%
That plays an enormous
role in your thoughts

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of the day.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.838 align:middle line:84%
When negative thoughts come
in about a problem, oh,

00:18:43.838 --> 00:18:46.130 align:middle line:84%
you've got to deal with this,
it's like, you know what?

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:90%
We can find a way around this.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:90%
We can manage this.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Anything can be
solved when you're

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:90%
in the right frame of mind.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
I look at it nothing other
than loving yourself.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And if we can all love
ourselves a little bit more,

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.240 align:middle line:84%
then we can be more positive
not only to ourselves,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.240 align:middle line:90%
but to people around us.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually
prosper and go forward

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and accomplish those goals
that we've set ourselves to do.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:84%
It is a topic that's
not often spoken about.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.645 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad that you're
able to openly speak

00:19:21.645 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:90%
about it in that way.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Because the emotional elements
of making peace with your body

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.690 align:middle line:84%
is such an important
conversation.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's unfortunate
that advertising

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and our modern world doesn't
really allow us to do that.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Look, I think that one of the
things that I try to share

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.550 align:middle line:90%
is that, what is healthy?

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:90%
What is being healthy?

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Being healthy is not necessarily
being on the cover of swimsuit

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:84%
"SI," whatever that magazine
is, being on the cover of these

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:84%
incredible bodies that
just look like they're--

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle line:84%
where do they come
from, what planet,

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.990 align:middle line:84%
these guys with these
not 6 packs, 12 packs,

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:84%
the veins popping
here and everywhere.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't look at that
and say, that's healthy.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I respect the training
those people went through

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and I respect the majority of
it's genetics and good luck.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:84%
You were lucky when it
came to the genetic pool.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I think healthy is being able
to do the things you want

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
to do, James, with
ease, so if you want

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.975 align:middle line:84%
to take the kids for a hike
and it's a three-hour hike,

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:90%
that you can do it.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go down to the
beach and surf for three hours,

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.580 align:middle line:90%
great.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.413 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go and
swim a mile in a pool,

00:20:33.413 --> 00:20:35.120 align:middle line:90%
you can do it and enjoy it.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
To me, doing things you
want to do with ease

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:90%
is what being healthy is.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
vision and this idea

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:84%
that if you're overweight, if
you're 20, 30 pounds, 50 pounds

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:84%
overweight, that somehow
you're not healthy.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:50.860 align:middle line:90%
That's all garbage.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
20% of people can be 10
to 20 pounds overweight

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and have absolutely no
problems whatsoever.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:84%
There's an enormous amount
of people that are too thin.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
We call them skinny-fat,
living on caffeine

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.665 align:middle line:84%
and nicotine, smoking and
drinking coffee all day.

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:90%
And they're undernourished.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're just at risk of
cancer, just at risk of stroke,

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:84%
just at risk of heart disease
as someone who's 300 pounds.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So we have to really be
careful here just to judge

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:84%
this book by the cover and
say, well, because she's thin

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.550 align:middle line:90%
and he's thin, they're healthy.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And that girl and
that bloke, they're

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:90%
fat so they're unhealthy.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.788 align:middle line:90%
That's complete baloney.

00:21:27.788 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the things,
just touching on the previous

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.300 align:middle line:84%
question, is that you
could be the fittest person

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:84%
in the world, but if you've
got a lot of negative self-talk

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're always
unhappy and depressed,

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.887 align:middle line:90%
then what's the point of it?

00:21:36.887 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Hundred percent.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you talk
about a reboot,

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:84%
one of the things you mentioned
just before was that it's not

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:90%
restricted just to juicing.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> You said that a reboot is
something-- a reboot or a--

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I think there's fasting,
which is more extreme.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.252 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you've got
this reboot idea of yours,

00:21:55.252 --> 00:21:56.312 align:middle line:90%
which is more about--

00:21:56.312 --> 00:21:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I love how you say it,
running towards Mother Nature.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.370 align:middle line:90%
I use that quite a bit, Joe.

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Hope you don't mind.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I quote you.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I quote you.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're just like,
how can somebody

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.650 align:middle line:84%
who might be looking to
just reboot their life

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:84%
or give themselves a
kickstart get as much fruits

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables-- or
vegetables and fruits,

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
probably, into their diet
as possible in a 7, 10, 20,

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:90%
30-day window?

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And so people can choose
to do a reboot with juices,

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.580 align:middle line:84%
with smoothies, maybe
with soups, maybe

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.790 align:middle line:90%
with eating some vegetables.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:27.055 --> 00:22:27.855 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:27.855 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>> So why do you suggest that?

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Because we're all different.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.920 align:middle line:84%
The way I think about
it, James, is this.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I use this analogy of
the local swimming pool.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Go down to the local town
swimming pool in summer

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.860 align:middle line:90%
and have a look.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:84%
What do you notice,
James, about people

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:90%
who get out of a swimming pool?

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.000 align:middle line:90%
What's the common theme?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>> There is none.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>> They're wet.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>> You get out of a swimming
pool, you're wet, OK?

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.160 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
how did you get wet?

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Did you jump in or did you
slowly walk down the stairs,

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:90%
de de de.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Two types of people
in this world, people

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.120 align:middle line:84%
who want to dive in and go
all for nothing and there

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:84%
are others who want
to take it slow,

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.205 align:middle line:84%
step by step, little bit at a
time, change this, change that.

00:23:07.205 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not one of those people
who can walk into the swimming

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
pool, going down and letting
the water slowly come up

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.220 align:middle line:90%
all the way.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm the jump in, dive in guy.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Hence, my journey was
about 60 days of juice.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:90%
We're going to knock this over.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.020 align:middle line:90%
Other people are not like that.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.548 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of
people who say,

00:23:25.548 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:90%
that's just too extreme for me.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I just want to
incorporate plants.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:90%
How can I--

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So the last thing
I'm going to do

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
is say to somebody,
whoa, no, no.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.528 align:middle line:84%
You got to do juice and
that's the only way to do it.

00:23:35.528 --> 00:23:36.710 align:middle line:90%
That's nonsense.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So we try to create
a path for all,

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:84%
that if you want to
get wet, i.e., healthy,

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
you can jump in, either juice,
or you can slowly walk in,

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
which is juicing,
blending, and eating.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.337 align:middle line:84%
I often talk,
James-- and this is--

00:23:54.337 --> 00:23:56.420 align:middle line:84%
people say, oh, I don't
know if I could do that, I

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:90%
don't know if I could do that.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I go, well, listen,
let's just tell a story.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Imagine if you were--

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:84%
there was a great TV
show called "Lost"

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:84%
where they had a
crash in the Pacific

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.450 align:middle line:84%
and they ended up on
this desert island.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine if you're on
the desert island by yourself

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and you were there
for 40 or 50 days.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:84%
You had fresh running
water and you had shelter.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So 50 days, you're
going to be fine.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to die.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.305 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
be perfectly fine.

00:24:21.305 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:84%
You're going to just
drink water for 50 days.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
hungry and you're

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:84%
going to be doing it tough
the first three or four days.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I reckon by day
20, you're probably

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.830 align:middle line:90%
thinking, please, no one come.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm having the best time ever.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to
be feeling unbelievable.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But let's assume that
you get rescued on day 50

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're taken aboard
the ship and someone puts

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:84%
out this incredible mango,
pineapple, strawberries,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:84%
bananas, kale, cucumber, all
this platter of Mother Nature's

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:90%
finest.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you, James, that's
the best meal you're ever going

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.830 align:middle line:90%
to have in your whole life.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Scenario number
two, same person.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.542 align:middle line:84%
Forget about the
trip to the island.

00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's take them to
their best restaurant,

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
fill them up with the
pasta, the burgers,

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:84%
with the fries, the
beers, the wine.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's take them outside.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And in the car park
before they get in,

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:84%
here's this beautiful platter
of the pineapple, the mango,

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:84%
exactly what we did in
that first scenario.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, sorry, Joe.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:90%
I can't have any of that.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.017 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to taste
any good is it, James?

00:25:21.017 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Because what they've
done is we've--

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.658 align:middle line:90%
and this is what we do.

00:25:23.658 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:84%
We constantly bombard
ourselves with this food that

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:31.970 align:middle line:84%
has been manufactured to hit our
bliss point, this combination

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:84%
of sugar, fat, and salt that
these corporations have spent

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:84%
billions of dollars of
technology and marketing

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:84%
on to own this real estate in
our gut to get a hold of this.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult
for Mother Nature's finest

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:90%
to compete with that.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:50.007 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of this break,
this restart, this kick-- this,

00:25:50.007 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not having any of that
for a period of time, 5 days,

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:57.110 align:middle line:84%
10 days, that's emulating our
crash in the Pacific where we

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.340 align:middle line:84%
get to the island, so that
when you start eating again--

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.830 align:middle line:84%
avocado is the best
thing ever invented.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's the idea of it.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:84%
The idea of a reboot is
not about losing weight

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:90%
and a diet for the long term.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.780 align:middle line:84%
It's an idea to get you
to fall back in love

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.520 align:middle line:90%
with Mother Nature's finest.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the reentry
that we all need

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.580 align:middle line:84%
to do if we've
gone off the rails.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:84%
What's the hardest thing
about doing a reboot?

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.880 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of hard
things for some people.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:90%
For me, I don't find it hard.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.862 align:middle line:90%
So let's forget about me.

00:26:36.862 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what I've
learned from my community.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And you don't find it
hard because you've done it?

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I don't find it hard.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>> So...

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I find it boring.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:90%
I find it boring.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm bored as F. I am just
like, somebody shoot me.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:55.003 align:middle line:90%
Because it's boring.

00:26:55.003 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's going
out and I'm going

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.680 align:middle line:84%
to sit at home
with a green juice

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.222 align:middle line:84%
and watch another
episode on Netflix.

00:26:59.222 --> 00:27:02.467 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, I'm over this.

00:27:02.467 --> 00:27:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's worried about
how fast time is going,

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:90%
get yourself on a reboot.

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:90%
That'll slow it down.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.950 align:middle line:84%
You can really smell
the roses then.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.440 align:middle line:84%
But majority of people
that I speak to,

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.247 align:middle line:84%
they'll go into a
number of factors.

00:27:14.247 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they'll
probably go with cost.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.140 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, oh,
it's too much money.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- $25 a day
on juice is too much.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:84%
When I think about
that like two cocktails

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:90%
in a bar can cost you $25, but--

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Expensive bar,
that's one cocktail.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, true.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:90%
But I get it.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.315 align:middle line:84%
I understand that
it's-- for some people,

00:27:32.315 --> 00:27:33.440 align:middle line:90%
you got to buy the machine.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.140 align:middle line:90%
You got to buy--

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:34.940 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Time-consuming-- I get all that.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
But what people don't realize
is you can do it twice a week.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:84%
You can make a whole bunch
of juice for three days,

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:84%
seal it in glass jars, keep
it in the refrigerator.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:90%
That's fine, next three days.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Then you can juice again.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So you're only
doing two clean ups.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So this idea of it takes too
long to clean my juicer up

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:50.040 align:middle line:84%
versus blending--
blending, you've

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:90%
got to drink it straight away.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:84%
You got to clean up
seven times in a week.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.408 align:middle line:90%
Juicing is just twice.

00:27:54.408 --> 00:27:55.450 align:middle line:90%
This is really important.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.890 align:middle line:84%
But the next factor
is that they've

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.440 align:middle line:84%
got to cook for their
kids or their husband

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.360 align:middle line:90%
or their wife or their partner.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So there is this issue
of, I become anti-social.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So my family, my friends,
are doing something

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:90%
and I can't participate.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.530 align:middle line:90%
So that's a hard thing.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Another hard thing is
people's addictions.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:84%
People are addicted to
things like sugar, fat, salt

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:90%
and caffeine.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.310 align:middle line:90%
These are massive addictions.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:23.362 align:middle line:84%
And I get many, many emails
and people tell me, Joe,

00:28:23.362 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I can do to reboot,
but I need my coffee.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And I say, you know what?

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Do the reboot and
have the coffee.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather you do
that than not do it.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:90%
So have the coffee.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Try and bring your coffee down
over the time, the five days.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Try and go from two cups
to one and half cups.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:90%
See if you can get it down.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.660 align:middle line:90%
So it's the addiction.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.225 align:middle line:84%
And so I think these are the
tough things about a reboot.

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:51.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bit shocked--

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.340 align:middle line:84%
honestly, when I made
this movie nine years ago

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and it released
five years ago, I

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:57.920 align:middle line:84%
thought that there
would be nowhere

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.180 align:middle line:84%
near the uptake of
the tens of thousands,

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands, of
people that have done reboots

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.830 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:08.700 align:middle line:84%
It still amazes me that
I get very negative--

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'm being very honest
because there's no other way

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.560 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I've never had anyone
send me an email,

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.550 align:middle line:84%
say, wow, I did a
10-day reboot and I

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
felt like shit at the end
of it, no one, nobody.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I've heard people
say, I quit at day two

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.178 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like shit
and I quit at day three

00:29:24.178 --> 00:29:25.220 align:middle line:90%
because I couldn't do it.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:90%
I get a lot of that.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.540 align:middle line:84%
But I've never had someone
do what they said they were

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.850 align:middle line:90%
going to do and feel crappy.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.803 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't happen.

00:29:33.803 --> 00:29:35.470 align:middle line:84%
A hundred percent
success rate of people

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.190 align:middle line:90%
going, I'm on top of the world.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:38.360 align:middle line:90%
I feel unbelievable.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.942 align:middle line:90%
This is the best ever.

00:29:39.942 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's natural and
normal because your body's

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.310 align:middle line:90%
gone into survival mode.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:47.015 align:middle line:84%
We've tricked the body into
thinking it needs food.

00:29:47.015 --> 00:29:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you really
contemplate that, the--

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.170 align:middle line:84%
to make the magnificent James
here, for you to be here,

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:84%
we've needed, roughly speaking,
10,000 sets of grandparents

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.980 align:middle line:90%
of Homo sapiens.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.420 align:middle line:84%
We've been here
around 240,000 years.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you take an average of
24 years of age reproducing,

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.340 align:middle line:84%
you can say 10,000
sets of grandparents.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So 10,000 swaps of
genetic material

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.920 align:middle line:84%
have created you,
and same for me.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And your ancestors have
gone through periods

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:23.450 align:middle line:84%
of feast and famine, feast
and famine, feast and famine.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:84%
During the famine, what
actually got them through

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:84%
was this body shutting
down and saying,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.930 align:middle line:84%
right, we got to get James off
this bloody cave man floor,

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.230 align:middle line:84%
get him down onto the
savanna, walk 50 miles,

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.180 align:middle line:90%
and find bloody food, mate.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.168 align:middle line:90%
Get out there and find food.

00:30:40.168 --> 00:30:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do that, what do
you need to find food, James?

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.050 align:middle line:90%
You need better eyesight.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:46.910 align:middle line:84%
You need better sense
of hearing, smell.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:47.900 align:middle line:90%
You need more energy.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.900 align:middle line:84%
You need to be able to walk
for 30 miles a day, keep going,

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.370 align:middle line:90%
mate, till you get some food.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:90%
The body is assisting you.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.270 align:middle line:90%
You're in this survival mode.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people
experience after four days,

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:84%
on the fourth day
of juicing only,

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.590 align:middle line:90%
when no fiber has gone in.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.060 align:middle line:90%
You blend.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.580 align:middle line:84%
You're tricking is--
there's no trick anymore.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.590 align:middle line:90%
It's like eating.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So you don't get
this from eating.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to take the fiber
out to get to this nirvana of,

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm in survival mode.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that mode that you
get the euphoria, euphoria,

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.000 align:middle line:90%
this euphoric feeling.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's where religion
hijacked fasting.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Buddhists,
the Christians, the Muslims,

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:90%
the Hindus, all the big boys--

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.285 align:middle line:84%
they took fasting
and said, right,

00:31:35.285 --> 00:31:37.160 align:middle line:84%
let's go allow people
to fast because they're

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.633 align:middle line:90%
going to be closer to God.

00:31:38.633 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you do feel like
you're closer to God.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you can
run through brick walls.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's what your ancestors--

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's been
passed on in you.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.110 align:middle line:90%
You have that.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone listening,
everyone watching,

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.570 align:middle line:90%
they have that in their DNA.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Their body is far smarter
than they'll ever be.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:84%
It knows what to do
and how to heal itself

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:90%
if it's given the chance.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.400 align:middle line:90%
You got to give it the chance.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And fasting/juice fasting/eating
only fruits and vegetables

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.740 align:middle line:84%
is giving the body
that chance to heal.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It must be frustrating for
you to see so much pain

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and suffering in the world
and to know that such

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:25.310 align:middle line:90%
a simple solution exists.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:84%
How do you keep
positive in these times

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:31.210 align:middle line:84%
where-- we're coming up to
1 in 2 people have cancer.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.260 align:middle line:84%
We've got 1 in 2
with heart disease.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The World Health Organization
has said that diabetes,

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.030 align:middle line:84%
obesity, or diabesity,
as it's commonly referred

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:84%
to, and mental health
conditions are the three biggest

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.162 align:middle line:84%
challenges facing
the developed world.

00:32:47.162 --> 00:32:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's such
a simple solution.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Does that make you upset
or does it make you excited?

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I go through stages.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I get upset.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:03.005 align:middle line:84%
I get upset on a personal level,
for people, with their stories.

00:33:03.005 --> 00:33:07.110 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite an optimistic
person, James.

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe that if you want to
find a way to do something,

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.540 align:middle line:90%
you'll find a way.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.920 align:middle line:84%
But I've been blessed that
I was born into a family

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:27.020 align:middle line:90%
where my parents gave me that--

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I guess they created an
environment where they said,

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.370 align:middle line:84%
it's possible to do
something you believe in.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I know that a lot of people
are not born into family units

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.370 align:middle line:84%
where they get that
kind of encouragement

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:90%
from the beginning.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.790 align:middle line:90%
So I get that.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So when I am out seeing
what's going on in the world,

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I understand the huge
hurdles that we are facing,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.910 align:middle line:84%
the multi-billion-dollar
marketing campaigns for sugar,

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:00.300 align:middle line:84%
fat, and salt and caffeine
that are out there,

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:05.750 align:middle line:84%
the idea of escalators
and elevators and cars

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and transport to prevent
us from moving and walking,

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:12.469 align:middle line:84%
and just that idea of
picking up your cell phone,

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:15.350 align:middle line:84%
pressing an app, and
12,000 calories appearing

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:20.210 align:middle line:84%
in a cardboard box with
cheese filled in the crusts,

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:24.770 align:middle line:84%
running around the corner, and
two cans of soda that basically

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.170 align:middle line:90%
is just--

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.048 align:middle line:84%
how many hundred thousand
cubes of sugar in that?

00:34:29.048 --> 00:34:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can sit down
and watch a game

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.959 align:middle line:84%
and all the exercise you
did was press your thumb.

00:34:32.959 --> 00:34:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And if someone else opened the
door, you didn't have to move.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.639 align:middle line:90%
This is the hurdles against us.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:40.989 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm like anyone else, mate.

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I love being on the couch,
having soda, drinking soda,

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.560 align:middle line:90%
eating pizza.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.780 align:middle line:84%
It used to be my
favorite thing to do.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.689 align:middle line:90%
And I miss it.

00:34:48.689 --> 00:34:49.489 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Even just talking
about it now, I go,

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:51.920 align:middle line:90%
that would be fun, actually.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:56.389 align:middle line:84%
But I know that it'd be
fun for five minutes.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And after I've eaten
it, after I've drunk it,

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:00.410 align:middle line:90%
I'd feel like crap.

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.290 align:middle line:84%
So this little joy, this
little moment of joy,

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:05.840 align:middle line:84%
would then give me
depression for two weeks.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:90%
So I don't do it.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the presence of
mind not to do that.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.405 align:middle line:84%
So I get that so
many people out there

00:35:14.405 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:84%
haven't had the
opportunities that I have had

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.572 align:middle line:90%
and the encouragement I've had.

00:35:17.572 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So what I try to do, and
I know you try to do this,

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:25.520 align:middle line:84%
is create content that can
inspire, educate, entertain

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and show that if I can
do it, you can do it.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And if he or she can
do it, you can do it.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is where people are
drawing their inspiration from.

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:37.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a celebrity.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not this person
better than anyone else.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a knockabout,
average bloke.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Half the stuff that the
scientists know, I go and get

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.630 align:middle line:84%
it from them and
I try to take it--

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, forget that, forget that.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.700 align:middle line:84%
People aren't-- oh,
that, give me that.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.760 align:middle line:90%
Give me more on that.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.760 align:middle line:84%
My audience is going to
want to know about that.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.380 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like a translator.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I go to really smart,
interesting geniuses,

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.820 align:middle line:84%
listen to them for
three or four hours,

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and say, right, well, 20 minutes
of that was worthwhile sharing,

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.983 align:middle line:84%
capture that, and then
transform it into a way

00:36:11.983 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:84%
that it can be fun,
interesting, either an animation

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:18.200 align:middle line:84%
or if they're good enough,
play it in the movie.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And so to answer
this question about,

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.300 align:middle line:84%
am I disheartened--
no, because I

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.372 align:middle line:84%
think we've got technology
today, whether it's YouTube,

00:36:26.372 --> 00:36:28.580 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Netflix, whether
it's FMTV, whether it's

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.380 align:middle line:84%
all of these models that if
you are interested, if you want

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:84%
to find something
out, you can find

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.810 align:middle line:84%
credible people with good
hearts that are transparent,

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.120 align:middle line:90%
that are willing to share.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.593 align:middle line:84%
And I said to you
too earlier before we

00:36:43.593 --> 00:36:44.510 align:middle line:90%
started filming this--

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I said, I've learned a lot
on this nine-year journey

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:48.890 align:middle line:90%
I've been on.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:50.567 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
some of the stuff

00:36:50.567 --> 00:36:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about six, seven
years ago, five years ago, even

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:55.860 align:middle line:84%
three years ago, had I
known what I know now,

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I would have
shifted the message.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I would have said, do
this rather than that.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:01.100 align:middle line:90%
So I'm learning.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm evolving.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm doing is
opening doors for me

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.510 align:middle line:84%
to listen to the
experts and learn more.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.350 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm certainly--

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't see myself
as an expert at all.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I see myself as an
interpreter and someone

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:17.780 align:middle line:90%
who's just like you at home.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm just trying to do my best.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you shouldn't not
see yourself as a celebrity

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.890 align:middle line:84%
because I've seen people
stop you for photos, Joe.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:25.690 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah, but that's--

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.000 align:middle line:90%
they think I'm Russell Crowe.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:29.800 align:middle line:90%
They get mistaken.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're not Russell?

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry, mate.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.568 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, mate.

00:37:33.568 --> 00:37:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Bit of a practical one here.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:84%
What tips do you have for
people transitioning back

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.010 align:middle line:84%
to whole foods if
they've been doing

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:84%
a juicing or a
juicing/smoothieing

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.383 align:middle line:90%
or a little bit of food?

00:37:43.383 --> 00:37:44.550 align:middle line:90%
How do you transition after?

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.742 align:middle line:84%
It's really important that
the day of transition--

00:37:47.742 --> 00:37:49.200 align:middle line:84%
depends how long
you've been going.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.930 align:middle line:84%
If you've been doing
5, 10 days, then a day

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:51.890 align:middle line:90%
is fine, and get back.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:52.850 align:middle line:84%
If you go on
longer, you probably

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:53.808 align:middle line:90%
need two or three days.

00:37:53.808 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:90%
But I think foods that--

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.150 align:middle line:84%
if you just think about
things that are mushy already,

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:01.040 align:middle line:90%
like watermelons, pineapples--

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.460 align:middle line:84%
sweet potato is a good
one, roasted sweet potato,

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.450 align:middle line:84%
cauliflower, soups, things
that can be blended,

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:10.100 align:middle line:90%
that can be heated.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.860 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you, James,
30 days, the one thing

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that you miss a
lot is warm food.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Because 30-day
reboot I just did,

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.970 align:middle line:84%
mate, everything is
bloody cold, nothing warm.

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have that
first bit of warm soup or--

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.110 align:middle line:84%
I had a bit of dal,
a bit of lentil.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Ahh.

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:31.328 align:middle line:90%
It was unbelievable.

00:38:31.328 --> 00:38:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing which
is good for the blokes,

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.840 align:middle line:84%
not too good for the
girls, unfortunately--

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.720 align:middle line:84%
but because I've got
a bit of growth here,

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.200 align:middle line:84%
little bit of this, I go into
the surf and then I come out,

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.330 align:middle line:84%
towel myself down, but don't
towel the face, just lie there,

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.470 align:middle line:90%
let the salt water--

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:48.210 align:middle line:84%
so you get a salt
caught in your--

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.990 align:middle line:84%
yum yum-- taste a
bit of sea salt,

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:53.840 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have any salt
when you're rebooting either.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So these are little
things that are just so--

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.780 align:middle line:84%
they're just like
little moments that you

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.270 align:middle line:84%
take for granted when you're
not doing things like that.

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:05.060 align:middle line:84%
But transitioning
in, very important.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't put any protein.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.727 align:middle line:84%
I'm not eating animal
protein right now,

00:39:07.727 --> 00:39:10.340 align:middle line:84%
but I wouldn't put any animal
protein in for a day or two.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.313 align:middle line:90%
I'd go more plant proteins.

00:39:12.313 --> 00:39:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
we've learned now--

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.170 align:middle line:84%
one of things I was talking
about earlier is we've learned

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.003 align:middle line:84%
that you've got to put
protein in your juice

00:39:17.003 --> 00:39:19.430 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to juice
for more than 15 days.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:24.530 align:middle line:84%
When I lost my 82 pounds in
60 days, 70% of it was fat,

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.710 align:middle line:90%
but 30% of it was muscle.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want
to lose muscle.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.310 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:31.902 align:middle line:84%
So by having a
pea protein, which

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:33.860 align:middle line:84%
we have and I know you've
got some good protein

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.945 align:middle line:90%
powders as well--

00:39:34.945 --> 00:39:37.070 align:middle line:84%
incorporating those into
the juice, very important.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:38.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Good stuff.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.570 align:middle line:84%
What about any words
of wisdom for people

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that are thinking about
doing this sort of reboot,

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.330 align:middle line:84%
but they're not really sure or
they're a little bit scared of

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:49.410 align:middle line:90%
what to do?

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>> So I understand the fear.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:56.930 align:middle line:90%


00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:57.825 align:middle line:90%
It's change.

00:39:57.825 --> 00:39:59.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot people are--
really, what they're

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.520 align:middle line:90%
scared of is the change.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I would ask them to think of
change equaling opportunity.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:08.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a way to
challenge yourself.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:84%
This is an opportunity to think
about the amazing things--

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:18.320 align:middle line:84%
the holiday you're
giving your body.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I try to help tell them to
get outside of their body

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and look back at this incredible
apparatus, this organism,

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.668 align:middle line:90%
this thing we were given.

00:40:28.668 --> 00:40:29.960 align:middle line:90%
You only get one crack at this.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.360 align:middle line:90%
You only get one shot.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
about you, but maybe

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.100 align:middle line:84%
for the first 40
years of my life,

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't treating it
with much respect.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.510 align:middle line:90%
I was trashing it.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So when I do my reboots,
when I'm psyching myself up,

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:48.380 align:middle line:84%
when the going gets
a bit tough, I always

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.860 align:middle line:84%
think about the amazing things
that are going on in my body

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and just forget about my
selfishness for being bored,

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:58.700 align:middle line:84%
for not being able to go out
and have an incredible falafel

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:84%
even though it's vegan and
it's good, healthy eating, just

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:90%
this restriction.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think about what's
going on inside my body.

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:09.260 align:middle line:84%
I think about the energy that's
being used up and consumed.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't like people thinking
about it for weight loss.

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
the wrong message.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I think you've got
to think about it

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:18.140 align:middle line:84%
as the incredible
toxic cleanup that

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.680 align:middle line:90%
can take place in your system.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Your body is going to consume--

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:24.650 align:middle line:90%
and just take the average male.

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk calories
because I talk in calories,

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.113 align:middle line:90%
most of the audience being US.

00:41:29.113 --> 00:41:30.530 align:middle line:84%
If you're a male,
where you've got

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.840 align:middle line:84%
to consume 2,400
calories, James,

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and you do my juicing
program and you're

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.180 align:middle line:84%
having 800 calories a day,
your body is going to find--

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:84%
it's going to find the 1,600
calories on the human body

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:47.230 align:middle line:84%
to consume, to self-digest,
and feed your metabolism.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:48.420 align:middle line:90%
It ain't not gonna do it.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.700 align:middle line:90%
It's going to find them.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to go
around in your body

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and convert some of the fat into
energy, and some of the muscle

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.750 align:middle line:84%
if you're not careful
with your protein.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:00.830 align:middle line:90%
So let's think about it.

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:03.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't start
self-digesting your eye.

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:05.190 align:middle line:84%
You don't lose your
tongue overnight.

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.930 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't eat your liver or
your kidneys or your heart.

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:08.780 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.220 align:middle line:90%
The body is super smart.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:13.178 align:middle line:84%
It goes to the stuff
it needs the least.

00:42:13.178 --> 00:42:14.220 align:middle line:90%
So just think about that.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Think about all these cells
that haven't had a chance

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.510 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of-- and maybe
a little bit of a cyst

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.672 align:middle line:84%
or a little tumor
starting here or whatever.

00:42:22.672 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we don't need that.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Eat that, eat that.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, leave the liver.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Leave the gallbladder.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:27.330 align:middle line:90%
That's good stuff.

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Kidneys, leave that alone.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.690 align:middle line:90%
This is what happens.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And so over a period of time, I
visualize these little cleaners

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:35.920 align:middle line:90%
running around.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.060 align:middle line:90%
I seriously do this.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I visualize my body
self-digesting the crap.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:43.890 align:middle line:90%
And this gives me my momentum.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So for those who are
frightened, scared,

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.400 align:middle line:84%
just think about
how cool it would

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.510 align:middle line:84%
be to have this
little cleanup crew go

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:57.010 align:middle line:84%
through every crevice of
the insides of your body

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:00.580 align:middle line:90%
and scoop up all the bad shit.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.350 align:middle line:90%


00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.150 align:middle line:84%
To use the power of
visualization during a reboot,

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I think, is powerful, too, just
to imagine all that cleansing

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:10.910 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things you
touched on on this answer

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:18.430 align:middle line:84%
was about that feeling you
get when you start to eat food

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:19.870 align:middle line:90%
again and what you appreciate.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:23.050 align:middle line:84%
I think I have experienced a
lot of detoxing and cleanses

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and reboots over the years
of being in this health

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.180 align:middle line:90%
and wellness space.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
memorable things

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.570 align:middle line:84%
that I have coming out
of those experiences

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:33.840 align:middle line:84%
is how incredible an
avocado is or a peach.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's also
one of the benefits,

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.023 align:middle line:90%
is to remember how beautiful--

00:43:38.023 --> 00:43:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, fall back in
love with Mother Nature.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:40.740 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And how beautiful
natural foods are.

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:90%
It's such a gift.

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:44.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.093 align:middle line:90%
Final question here.

00:43:45.093 --> 00:43:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> If the world was your
classroom and you could

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:51.772 align:middle line:84%
literally walk out onto the
stage and there's all six

00:43:51.772 --> 00:43:53.980 align:middle line:84%
billion of us sitting there,
we can all hear you loud

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and clear, what is one
lesson that you would teach

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.570 align:middle line:90%
to humanity?

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> One lesson?

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:05.090 align:middle line:90%


00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I guess I would want to
share the power that I

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.250 align:middle line:90%
think is in fasting.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.420 align:middle line:90%


00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It'd be a tough sell,
but I'd give it a crack.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I'd need a bit of time.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Probably need 40 minutes.

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:25.420 align:middle line:90%
So it'd be like--

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.510 align:middle line:90%
I'd need some visual aids.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But I would probably
want to share

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:33.320 align:middle line:84%
the power of
fasting/going without

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:39.470 align:middle line:84%
focused on a specific
liquid water through plant

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:43.730 align:middle line:84%
only existence or a more
rigid water existence

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:45.950 align:middle line:84%
for this period of
four to five days.

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I think we're on the cusp,
James, of it really coming back

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:54.560 align:middle line:84%
into vogue, where
Millennials are so open

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that my Generation
X and the Baby Boomers

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.930 align:middle line:90%
really messed things up.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're very much focused on
a single voice and marketing

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and this way.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.987 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there is
a huge rebellion going on.

00:45:09.987 --> 00:45:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Look at mum and dad.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Look at the grandparents.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.877 align:middle line:90%
Look at them all sick.

00:45:12.877 --> 00:45:14.797 align:middle line:90%
They're all on diabetes.

00:45:14.797 --> 00:45:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's this generation
coming through saying,

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.230 align:middle line:90%
we don't want any of that.

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:21.090 align:middle line:84%
We value our health
much more importantly.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I see 21-year-old and
18-year-olds that are

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.080 align:middle line:90%
so into this that--

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.372 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't even thinking about
my health back then, mate.

00:45:26.372 --> 00:45:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about you, but I
wasn't even thinking about it.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe that
if we play this video in 10

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:38.300 align:middle line:84%
years' time, the whole game of
fasting and people working out

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.515 align:middle line:84%
whether they want to do
intermittent fasting,

00:45:40.515 --> 00:45:42.140 align:middle line:84%
whether they're doing
five-day fasting,

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.600 align:middle line:84%
whether they're doing one day
a week or one day a month--

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.970 align:middle line:84%
but they're
incorporating this idea

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:51.920 align:middle line:84%
of giving the body a break,
a rest, a chance to regroup,

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.600 align:middle line:90%
to re-fire up.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It's been such a huge
part of our success

00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:00.440 align:middle line:84%
as being the most successful
species on this planet.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I believe
is the reason why I am healthy

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.130 align:middle line:84%
today and I don't
take medication

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and I hardly ever
get sick and I feel

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.530 align:middle line:90%
incredibly strong and young--

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:84%
my knees don't feel so young,
but the rest of my body does--

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.020 align:middle line:84%
is because of this
idea of going without.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.280 align:middle line:90%
And so that would be probably--

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.520 align:middle line:84%
that lesson would be
the scientific lesson.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And if I could have one
spiritual lesson, James,

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.570 align:middle line:84%
or I could add in
the spiritual lesson,

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I would say that we all
need to love ourselves

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:35.060 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more and
give ourselves a break

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and don't be so tough
and hard on ourselves.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Majority of the time, we
are our own worst critic.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And we need to ease up and we
need to give ourselves a break.

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And we need to spend
more time with self-love.
