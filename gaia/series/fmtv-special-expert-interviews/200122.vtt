00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It's James here
from Food Matters.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.227 align:middle line:84%
And today we're going to
be talking about seven ways

00:00:13.227 --> 00:00:14.710 align:middle line:90%
to heal the gut naturally.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
The gut and the microbiome
has become a huge topic

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.830 align:middle line:90%
of discussion lately.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.440 align:middle line:84%
We're understanding more about
how the gut rules and controls

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.148 align:middle line:84%
so many different
elements of the body.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And we have an extra
special guest with me today,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:84%
naturopathic doctor and the
founder of Natural Instincts

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:90%
Healing, Kate Reardon.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Kate.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, James.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me a little
bit about yourself,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%
how you got into
this field of work,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and how we found
ourselves here today.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, my background's in
naturopathy and nutritional

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So I love using all
kinds of natural things

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:90%
to heal our bodies, basically.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also an
energetic healer.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And so my passion really
lies in the whole mind,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.160 align:middle line:90%
body, spirit side of health.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
interested in the gut.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I had gut problems when
I was a child growing up.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was more of a personal
discovery at the start.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And now I've built my
whole career around it.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So I have a health
retreat in Bali,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:84%
where people
actually come and do

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:84%
fasts, and detoxing,
and cleansing and things

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:84%
to primarily heal the gut
because it's that important.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So why is the
gut so important?

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.448 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're hearing
more about it these days.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the '80s,
it was about fat.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:90%
We shouldn't eat fat, you know.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:90%
And then it was all about carbs.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we're learning more
about the systemic nature

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:90%
of the gut and hormones.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But why has the gut become
such an important topic

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:90%
of discussion lately?

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, really simply, James,
it's the center of our being.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.235 align:middle line:84%
So you know when they
say "that gut feeling"?

00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:41.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really, really
important on all levels.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So physically, it's the way that
we get most of our nutrients,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:90%
by the food that we eat.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And if your nutrients,
and vitamins, and minerals

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:84%
aren't getting out to
the rest of your body,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:84%
then you're going
to not feel great,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and your health and
healing and vitality

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:90%
just isn't going to be there.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So it all comes back to
how we digest food in the gut.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And also, on an
emotional level, it's

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
our self-worth and
our self-esteem.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It's that inner power, that
core-like drive that we have.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's important on all levels.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm so excited
to chat to you about today,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
is how to really go in deeper
and how can we really help

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:84%
heal ourselves, mind, body, and
spirit, starting with the gut.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.672 align:middle line:84%
>> So if someone has a
gut that's out of whack--

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and I can certainly feel myself
when my gut's out of whack.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Like if I have too much
bread or too much gluten,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
or if I'm stressed out,
I'll start to notice it.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.315 align:middle line:84%
But it'll be subtle
for me at first.

00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And then there'll be
different symptoms

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:90%
that will develop later.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.695 align:middle line:84%
But for people
that are listening

00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
to this interview, what are
some of the major symptoms

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:84%
that their gut might not
be operating efficiently?

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, our body
is just so wise.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And it tells us when
things are out of balance.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So if your gut's
out of balance, it's

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:84%
different for every
single person.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
What you experience
is going to be

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:90%
different to what I experience.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:84%
So it could be anything from
headaches, to nausea, diarrhea,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
constipation, just
bloating, indigestion.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It could even be as deep
as skin rashes, poor sleep.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:84%
The menstrual cycle for
women can be thrown out.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.103 align:middle line:84%
You can feel really irritable or
just like-- grr-- all the time.

00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe that's like
irritable bowel syndrome?

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, exactly.

00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Irritable person syndrome.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, exactly.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And just different things
within the appetite as well.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So decreased appetite,
or not hungry,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:90%
or ravenous all the time.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many
signs and symptoms.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we wanted to talk about
transitioning to these tips

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:84%
for helping people
heal the gut naturally,

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know that you
go through this in-depth

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:84%
at your retreats, where
you take people step

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.247 align:middle line:90%
by step through this process.

00:03:57.247 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:84%
But you know, if we were going
to go through these seven

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
tips-- and keeping in mind that
there's people like me that

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
will be in my kitchen in 10
minutes after this interview,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:84%
or there's people at home
that'll be in their kitchens

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:84%
or going through
their day-to-day life

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:90%
after they watch this interview.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So what are some
of the seven steps?

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the first things
you wanted to talk about,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
I think, was food and the
foods we should be eating

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:90%
and shouldn't be eating.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, well, you
guys at Food Matters

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:84%
just have the most amazing
knowledge and recipes

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:90%
that everyone can get.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And the primary thing,
keeping it super simple,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
is choosing foods that
are closest to Mother

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Nature intended them to be.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So we call them
whole foods, right?

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:90%
So any type of processing--

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:84%
heating and processing
in different ways--

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:84%
it takes all the bioavailable
vitamins and minerals out

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:90%
of the food.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So I have this
general rule of thumb,

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:84%
which is the more
colors on the packet

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and the longer the shelf
life, the harder it

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:90%
is to digest in the body.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So eating whole foods,
like fresh fruits

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
and veggies and things like
that, it sounds simple.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:90%
We all know it.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.610 align:middle line:90%
But it has profound effects.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you just cut out
processed food out of the diet,

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee your gut
will be functioning

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:90%
better from straight away.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel it instantly.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying in a
roundabout way is that a lot

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
of processed food is causing
these gut issues as well,

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So eliminating certain foods
and eating more of the foods

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:90%
that nature intended.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.388 align:middle line:84%
>> You sound like
my grandmother.

00:05:28.388 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's how we
meant to eat, right,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:90%
like our grandparents ate.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.685 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
have all this

00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
processed food, and frozen
meals, and all that stuff.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:90%
It didn't exist back then.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.282 align:middle line:84%
And I think about
Laurentine's grandmother,

00:05:40.282 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:84%
who passed away, bless her,
last year at 102 years of age.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That's incredible.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The reality for her was that
the first 30 or 40 years of her

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.990 align:middle line:84%
life, she ate 100%
organic, almost 100% local

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and in season, and with
hardly any packaged foods

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:90%
or pre-prepared foods.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
There might have been
some preserved foods

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.635 align:middle line:84%
which were preserved by
her in a traditional way.

00:06:01.635 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So to think in such a
short period of time,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:84%
we've come so far from
that and now we're

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:84%
experiencing so many
gut-related issues,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense to sort of run
back to that idea that we had.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And processing strips all the
minerals and vitamins out,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.583 align:middle line:90%
and the taste.

00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And then what we
have to do is add

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
in all of these
chemical additives

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
so it actually tastes
like something.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So what you're eating
is not actually food.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a food-based product.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Processed foods aren't
good for the gut.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>> So eat real food.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Step one.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Step two, you said, it's
about the way we eat.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.008 align:middle line:90%
>> The way we eat.

00:06:37.008 --> 00:06:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that important?

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so important, James.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone thinks,
OK, I've got to eat.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:84%
We know we have to eat
healthy to feel good, right?

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But quite so often,
we're running around,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
eating in the car,
eating at our desk,

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.390 align:middle line:84%
eating while watching the kids,
and eating at our computers.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And how we eat really
affects biochemically

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:90%
how we digest our food.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So the first steps of
digestion, number one

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.850 align:middle line:90%
is smelling, smelling the food.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And number two is
tasting and chewing.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll bet there's so many
people that skip that step,

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.300 align:middle line:90%
the smelling.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's in before
they even smell it.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:07:14.617 --> 00:07:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I've been
guilty sometimes.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:84%
When we get busy, it's
just like, I need to eat.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like, quick, food now.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But the smelling stage is
called the cephalic stage.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And when we smell our
food, this hormone actually

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:84%
goes up to the brain, and
that triggers the body

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:90%
to start getting ready for food.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So the stomach will start
secreting hydrochloric acid.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:84%
All the enzymes will
be getting ready.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you're smelling
your food already inside,

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.370 align:middle line:84%
it's like your little
digestive system is going,

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:90%
hey, right, woo-hoo!

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:90%
We're getting fed.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
starting to flow.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:90%
And then number two is chewing.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, I see people all
the time that don't

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:90%
chew their food properly.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And I can't emphasize
this enough.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the more
you chew, there's

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:84%
all the salivary
glands in the mouth,

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and the enzymes
break that food down.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So by the time it gets down the
esophagus and into the stomach,

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:84%
it's nice and easy to be
broken down by the acid.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you're just
inhaling or swallowing,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.510 align:middle line:84%
then the stomach
has to work harder.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to put any
extra pressure on an already

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:84%
functioning digestive
system because it's

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.633 align:middle line:90%
hard enough to digest anyway.

00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And this seems like a
trap that people would fall

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:90%
into altogether.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.093 align:middle line:84%
It's like they don't smell
it, they don't chew it.

00:08:32.093 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:84%
They eat while
they're on the run,

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.520 align:middle line:84%
or they eat while
they're on the tube,

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:84%
or they eat while
they're watching TV.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So you know, to stop and think
about each of those three steps

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:84%
causes you to be in
the moment, causes you

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:90%
to be present with your food.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's like you know when
you smell, like, amazing, like,

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.790 align:middle line:84%
mom's cooking or something,
wafting through the air,

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and you're like,
oh, that's so good.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I want some of that.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the chemical reaction
that actually happens.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But it happens in
every single meal.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And that link is a major
link that we don't really

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:90%
practice in modern day lives.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe when we sit down
to say grace or whatever,

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle line:84%
an evening ritual, let's
all smell our meal.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Giving thanks to Mother Earth
for providing this for us

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and getting our body ready
to absorb and assimilate

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:90%
the nutrients.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, cool.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting one.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm down for that.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're going
to do it today, right?

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.037 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm going to do it today.

00:09:26.037 --> 00:09:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I have a little ritual before
I eat and wherever I am,

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.753 align:middle line:90%
whether it's on an airplane--

00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:84%
that's particularly when
I get strange looks--

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:90%
or whether it's at dinnertime.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.727 align:middle line:84%
I just sort of hold my hands
out and do a short blessing.

00:09:36.727 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And it can be as
simple as just saying

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:84%
the word "thank you," or
"thanks," or just having some--

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that triggers my body
to be like, OK, just slow it

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:90%
down a bit.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:90%
We're here to digest.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.972 align:middle line:90%
We're here to eat.

00:09:48.972 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And I've found that a really
important ritual for me.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.305 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a great thing
that we've incorporated

00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:90%
into family dinners.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>> That has a powerful
biochemical effect

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.102 align:middle line:90%
on the physical body.

00:10:00.102 --> 00:10:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was another thing
that I wanted to bring up,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.753 align:middle line:84%
was just having a moment of,
like, OK, I'm going to eat now.

00:10:06.753 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So whatever that is
to you, whether it's

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:84%
deep breaths, or saying thank
you or grace before meals.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But it actually allows
the body to know that it's

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:90%
going to be getting food soon.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, so step one is
eat whole foods.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Step two is the way you eat.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Smelling--

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Smelling--

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Chewing--

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Chewing.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And being in a
stress-free environment.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And step three I have here
on the list is, what was it,

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:84%
external factors, the
listening to your body.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So how do we become more
attuned with our body,

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and why is listening to our
body important for gut health?

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Any signs and symptoms that
you experience is your body

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:90%
talking to you.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you are experiencing a
bit of nausea, or a headache,

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.580 align:middle line:84%
or your skin's broken
out, ringing in the ears,

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84%
your hair and nails
just aren't thriving,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:84%
your body is trying
to tell you something.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's tapping into
that wisdom that's

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:84%
the real key in not only
accelerating your health,

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:90%
but getting that vitality back.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So in relation to the gut and
how we want to look at that,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:90%
it's like how am I feeling now?

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, I might
be a bit nauseous,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.760 align:middle line:84%
not feeling so great,
just not in my flow.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And then so what did
I eat last night,

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:90%
or what did I eat yesterday.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And just putting the
correlation together.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Because no one knows your
body better than you.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And the deeper you can go
into learning and reading

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:44.060 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom, it's talking
to us every single day.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And like I said before,
we're all different.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So you and I could go
out, eat the same meal

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
that is probably not good for
either of us, let's just say--

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
we'd never do that,
but let's just say--

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and you would experience
different physical signs

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.800 align:middle line:90%
and symptoms to what I would.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So for me, if I'm eating
too much wheat and gluten,

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
like you mentioned before, I get
really bloated and really foggy

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:90%
in my head.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:90%
It's more like my thoughts.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I just can't get that clarity.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for me, I know
if I eat too much gluten,

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.242 align:middle line:84%
which I lovingly do when
I'm on holidays in Europe

00:12:17.242 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:84%
because the bread is
so beautiful there--

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't count in Europe.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.743 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't count.

00:12:20.743 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:22.640 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things I get is I'll

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:84%
start to get dandruff,
randomly enough.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very strange
thing to try to connect.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But I've noticed
it a few times now.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll see
people with dandruff.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I wonder if
that's, for them, the case

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:35.832 align:middle line:90%
And it may or may not be.

00:12:35.832 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:84%
But I've started to find
some subtle connections

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.352 align:middle line:84%
in my body with what I eat
and then what I notice later.

00:12:42.352 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's really a
profound idea about this point,

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.340 align:middle line:84%
around listening
to your body, is

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:84%
the idea of eat for how
you're going to feel later,

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.530 align:middle line:90%
not how you feel in the moment.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And that really can be a very
tough thing to do at times.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But the more that you
experience this biofeedback

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:84%
mechanism, the more
I've been able to know

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.557 align:middle line:84%
that if I eat that, I'm
going to be irritable later,

00:13:02.557 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to be edgy,
or I'm going to be foggy.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll start to
tend away from those foods

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.240 align:middle line:90%
naturally.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is critical
with the gut.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So I guess a takeaway
home for people

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:84%
at home, how do I tap
into my body's wisdom.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Do a food diary,
writing down what

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:84%
you're actually eating that
day and how you're feeling.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we can do the
opposite to this as well.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Those foods that make us
feel vibrant, and alive,

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and motivated, and just
really energetic, look

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:90%
and see what they are.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And bring more of them
into the diet as well.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:90%
So it works both ways.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you also suggesting that
there's not one diet that fits

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:90%
one person?

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I would be
suggesting that, James.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, of course.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:84%
We're all such unique
individual creatures.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And knowing what is
like the body's wisdom

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.520 align:middle line:84%
is not only what doesn't serve
me, but what does serve me,

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:90%
and how can I incorporate that.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And writing it all
down and just listening

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
to the signs and
symptoms of your body,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
taking a few moments every
day, sitting quietly--

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:90%
how am I feeling?

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:90%
Like, how am I actually feeling?

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:90%
I've got a bit of tension.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.530 align:middle line:90%
My stomach's a bit rumbly.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.555 align:middle line:84%
Just really listening,
because your body

00:14:14.555 --> 00:14:17.000 align:middle line:90%
is talking to you all the time.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And when we listen and
extract that wisdom,

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.398 align:middle line:84%
we're able to give the
body what it needs.

00:14:21.398 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
When you give the
body what it needs,

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be perfectly
functioning, better

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:90%
than it ever could be.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Next point is stress.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.420 align:middle line:90%
This is a huge one.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, when
I think about stress,

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:84%
there's so many different
elements to stress.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.722 align:middle line:84%
There is the stress
of like, well, I'm

00:14:39.722 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:84%
flying to another
country, and I've

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:84%
got back-to-back
meetings for two weeks.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Or there is the
stress of, like, is

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.710 align:middle line:84%
something going to be right
at home in our personal life.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the stress
of, like, toxins on the body.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Or there's the stress of,
like, environmental stress

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:84%
or stressful relationships
and people you're around.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So what type of stress
impacts the gut,

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.310 align:middle line:90%
and how can we deal with that?

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> All stress-- it doesn't
matter where it comes from,

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.400 align:middle line:84%
it puts us into what we
call flight or fight mode.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.760 align:middle line:84%
So what that means
is that there's

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:84%
a hormone called cortisol in
our body, and it's elevated.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So when our cortisol
is elevated,

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.070 align:middle line:84%
all our natural
enzymes and acids

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:84%
that break down and help us to
absorb our food is decreased.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't really
matter what type of stress

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:90%
you're going under.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It could be just a bad building
at work with lots of computers.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:84%
It just decreases the body's
natural ability to digest.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So what we really want to do,
in terms of healing our gut--

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.540 align:middle line:90%
and it starts with the gut.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But dealing with stress
has such profound effects

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:84%
on every single
part of your life.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is like where it starts,
and it just ends up everywhere,

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:84%
if you feel so
amazing, is to really--

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to use
the word de-stress,

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:84%
but balance out
the stress levels.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean for you?

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.450 align:middle line:84%
It could be going for a surf,
or sitting down for 10 minutes

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.260 align:middle line:84%
without a fight, or just
being out in the ocean,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
or getting your
feet on the ground

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and just really letting the
body's natural ability to heal

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:90%
itself come back.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And in going back and saying
what we were talking about

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:84%
before, never eating when
you're really, really,

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.540 align:middle line:90%
really stressed.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Because everything contracts
when we're in flight or fight.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
trying to put food

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:84%
in when you're all
contracted and stressed,

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.010 align:middle line:84%
then the body's not going
to digest it properly.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's
so important to--

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.930 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES] like, hey,
I'm going to eat now.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to nourish my body.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to drink some water.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.620 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to feel good.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.555 align:middle line:90%
Can you see the difference?

00:16:49.555 --> 00:16:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing we
covered was the food to eat.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Then we covered the way you eat.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Then we covered
listening to your body.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And then we just did stress.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And now the next
point is purpose.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this is
a fascinating one.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a big one.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a big one.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have some
films inside FMTV,

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.990 align:middle line:84%
such as "Finding Joe," which
talks about Joseph Campbell's

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.300 align:middle line:84%
way of the warrior,
the hero's journey,

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.869 align:middle line:84%
and how important it
is to be on purpose.

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I
find that whenever

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not following
my purpose, then

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I find myself more stressed
out or less motivated.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And the more that I bring
myself back to center,

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I really feel great
about so many things

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.655 align:middle line:90%
and feel good in my body.

00:17:34.655 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we're
talking about?

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly what
we're talking about.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's that age old thing of,
I should have followed my gut,

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.920 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Because this governs
so much in our life

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.470 align:middle line:90%
beyond the physical body.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So there's a energy center
here called the solar plexus.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And the solar plexus is where
our inner power comes from.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.240 align:middle line:84%
It's our self-worth
and who we are

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and what we're
presenting to the world.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
on track with that,

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard for the
gut to not be as well.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Because we're more than the
muscle and bones of our body,

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:84%
where we have these big,
beautiful mind that can help us

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
create amazing things.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're part of a bigger
spiritual source as well.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Whatever label you want to put
on it, it's all the same thing.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.080 align:middle line:90%
It's mind, body, spirit.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:90%
That's what makes us up.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So I always look
at people who come

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:84%
to see me for really horrible
gut things physically.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.427 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, I'm
always like, well,

00:18:35.427 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:90%
how are you feeling emotionally?

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's always a
story, or there's always

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:90%
something going on.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're just treating
the gut physically,

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:84%
you're never really
going to get well.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Because we're more than this.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you're looking
at both of them,

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
then you have this synergy
of holistic healing.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
not only get well,

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:90%
but you're going to thrive.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the difference between
feeling OK and feeling

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, my god,
this is so amazing.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I get
to live this life.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some examples of
people or some general examples

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
or ideas of people that
are not on purpose?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Is it them following a
career that they don't love?

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.205 align:middle line:84%
Or is it them following
a person or relationship

00:19:15.205 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:90%
that they don't love?

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Or is it all of the above?

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it other things?

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.250 align:middle line:90%
How can people relate to this?

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I think those are
really good examples.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:84%
But I also think
it's anything that's

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:84%
not in true alignment
with who you are.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Because quite often,
our decisions and things

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
that we do, we're trying
to please other people,

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
or keeping other
people happy, or doing

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.070 align:middle line:84%
what we think we
should do instead of

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:90%
what we really want to do.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Joseph talks
about in the "Hero's Journey."

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.880 align:middle line:84%
It's following that
bliss, following

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
that bigger thing that's
going to make you feel alive.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
chasing, or following,

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:84%
or embracing
something that makes

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:84%
you feel so happy and so joyful,
how can the body not feel that,

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.270 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:90%
So it really comes down.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's been so
much scientific research

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:09.010 align:middle line:84%
out there that our emotions
affect our biochemistry,

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:10.870 align:middle line:90%
and specifically the gut.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:84%
There is such a strong
gut-mind connection.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And you know, this is science.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:84%
They are discovering more
and more and more every day.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So in the words of
Joseph Campbell,

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
if you're following your
bliss, then I would say,

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:84%
essentially, you're
healing your gut.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.102 align:middle line:90%
Follow your bliss, here you go.

00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:35.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the next thing we
have is water and hydration.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, this is a huge one.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:84%
They call me the
water police in Bali

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.410 align:middle line:84%
because I'm always saying to
people, how much water have you

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:90%
drunk today?

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Most of the signs and
symptoms of our body,

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
those little niggly ones-- like
headache-y, or not quite right,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:90%
or dry throat, or dry skin--

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.620 align:middle line:90%
all comes down to dehydration.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And the digestive system
needs a lot of water

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:84%
to really let everything
go, especially

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:84%
with the peristalsis,
moving things

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:90%
through the large intestine.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be
nice and lubricated

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:84%
for a good smooth passage
and a good evacuation.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:90%
So you need to drink water.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.910 align:middle line:84%
There's no way of
getting around this.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:90%
Everyone needs to drink water.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, the
oxygen molecule from water

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
provides the lining of the
gut with heaps of minerals

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:90%
that it needs to heal.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So not only are you
hydrating yourself,

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:84%
you're actually healing
the very, very, very

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:84%
tiny microbial life
that sit inside the gut.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:36.605 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:21:36.605 --> 00:21:37.405 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:21:37.405 --> 00:21:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really important.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a simple one.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.037 align:middle line:84%
But everyone just
needs to drink water.

00:21:43.037 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:84%
There's no way of
getting around this.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.730 align:middle line:90%
We all know it.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's putting
it into practice.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So getting things like having
a water bottle on your desk

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Or in the shower.

00:21:52.233 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a great place
to drink water.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Or I even get clients
to set an alarm

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.180 align:middle line:84%
on their phone three times
a day that says drink water.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're busy,
we're running around--

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and we've got crazy
lives, right--

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.220 align:middle line:90%
we forget.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:90%
We're human.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So just reminding yourself to
constantly be drinking water.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you drink
a perfect amount

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.070 align:middle line:84%
of water, so minimum of two
liters a day, per person,

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.420 align:middle line:84%
even if it's winter, and more
in summer when you're sweating

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and if you're doing cardio
and things like that--

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:84%
you will be operating
at such a better level

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
biochemically than
if you're not.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's so-- can you say
I'm passionate about it?

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:90%
It's so important, James!

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I know from experience
that the more water I drink,

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:40.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the toilet.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:41.680 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:90%
And both ways, you know.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
important thing.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.747 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the main
ways that we detoxify.

00:22:46.747 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the main ways.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And toxins obviously
impact our function.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:90%
So great stuff.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:90%
So drink more water-- hydration.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a simple one,
but it's so crucial.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.800 align:middle line:90%
It's so crucial.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.633 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's get down
to some specifics here.

00:22:58.633 --> 00:23:00.460 align:middle line:84%
The seventh point we
have here to discuss

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.580 align:middle line:90%
is supplements and herbs.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure a lot of
people out there

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.540 align:middle line:84%
have watched a TV commercial
with the good bacteria

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.683 align:middle line:90%
versus the bad bacteria.

00:23:08.683 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're out there
buying probiotics,

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:90%
or they're taking some herbs.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:84%
How effective are these
supplements, what supplements

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:84%
are good, and what do
you sort of generally

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:84%
recommend for a gut
healing protocol?

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first thing to
really getting our heads about

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:84%
is that your gut needs to
absorb and assimilate nutrients.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.630 align:middle line:90%
That's its primary function.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not really
looking after the gut,

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.395 align:middle line:84%
you could be eating the best
organic died on the planet.

00:23:38.395 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you've gut isn't
functioning properly,

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.400 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
get those nutrients.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And so what that really
means is getting down

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:90%
into the nitty-gritty.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So like you mentioned
before, the probiotics--

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:84%
getting all the gut flora right,
getting all the inflammation

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:84%
out of the stomach
lining, making

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:84%
sure you've got adequate acid
coming out of the stomach,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and also the liver and
pancreas and small intestine,

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and all the enzymes
and everything's

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.240 align:middle line:90%
working really, really well.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.990 align:middle line:90%
So probiotics is a big one.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know you guys
love fermented foods.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And you have lots of
recipes and tips about that.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:90%
That is fantastic.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.667 align:middle line:84%
Because what it's doing, it's
building up that good bacteria.

00:24:18.667 --> 00:24:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I see
it, it's like they're

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:90%
little army men in the gut.

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.068 align:middle line:84%
So if you're eating something
that's not so good for you

00:24:25.068 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:84%
or meant to be in there, it's
like, hey, you get out of here.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Get out.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Or if you eat well, and
you've got stress and so forth,

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:31.283 align:middle line:90%
it's supporting you.

00:24:31.283 --> 00:24:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It's supporting you.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's really,
really important.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So fermented foods,
things like sauerkraut

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and all that kind of
stuff, good probiotic.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Some things that I really
recommend is aloe vera juice.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Because you know when
your skin is sunburned,

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
it's red and inflamed, and
you put aloe on to soothe it?

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It is exactly the
same inside the gut.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got red inflamed
esophagus, and all the way

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
down out through the
anus, then the aloe vera

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:84%
actually puts this beautiful
musilage effect on it.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
find one, though,

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:90%
that's not loaded with sugar.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:90%
So it's really bitter.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.925 align:middle line:84%
If it tastes gross, it's
probably the best one.

00:25:13.925 --> 00:25:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a reason they
say bitter medicine.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been actually recently
cutting aloe from the garden

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:90%
and putting it through a juicer.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's getting that--

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Making it into smoothies.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.968 align:middle line:90%
Or aloe vera sashimi.

00:25:26.968 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I haven't heard of that.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:90%
It's like sashimi--

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm going to try that.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> A little bit of
tamari or something.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's a cool idea.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Any herbs?

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Another herb that's similar
process to aloe vera is

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:84%
slippery elm, which
is the bark of a tree.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And it comes in powdered
form or capsules.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:90%
Powder's the best, though.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And what it actually does is the
cells of our digestive system

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:84%
sit in there, and they're
meant to look like a Lego.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And so as food's
coming in, it kind of

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.750 align:middle line:90%
has this protective mode.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But if we're eating heaps
of processed foods, heaps

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.210 align:middle line:84%
of stimulants,
we're stressed, you

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:84%
know, just the
day-to-day living,

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:84%
it affects the integrity
of the gut wall.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So those Lego
pieces split apart.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call
leaky gut syndrome.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And then all the
minerals and nutrients

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:84%
leak out before we can
properly absorb them.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So what slippery elm
does, it puts a nice coat

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of the gut.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So it keeps all the
minerals in here

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.270 align:middle line:84%
so that we're able to absorb
and assimilate them, whilst

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.010 align:middle line:90%
healing the cells of the gut.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really,
really awesome one.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And my favorite
way to have this is

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.620 align:middle line:84%
a teaspoon in some water with
some high grade manuka honey.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, nice.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the manuka
honey helps it to heal.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it a powdered form,
or is it like a tea form?

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a powdered form.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The powdered form is more
potent, so it's better.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And heat it up in a
little bit of warm water

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:90%
and drink it before bed.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:90%
It's called a belly love drink.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Belly love.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so let's recap
here a little bit.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So we've gone through
these seven tips

00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.813 align:middle line:90%
for healing we got naturally.

00:26:59.813 --> 00:27:01.730 align:middle line:84%
We've looked at some of
the problems initially

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and some of the symptoms
of healing the gut.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.898 align:middle line:84%
And you said they can be many
and varied, from skin rashes,

00:27:05.898 --> 00:27:09.260 align:middle line:84%
to nausea, to weight gain, to
fatigue, to chronic illness.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So step one was eat as
mother nature intended.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Eat whole foods.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Whole, vibrant, colorful,
yummy, delicious food.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Number two was the
way that you eat.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, smelling, tasting,
chewing, mindfulness.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Number three was
listening to your body.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Just taking a few moments
every day to tune in

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and ask yourself,
how am I feeling?

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Number four was purpose.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, following your bliss.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Number five was stress.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, de-stressing wherever
you can and bringing yourself

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.770 align:middle line:84%
back into a balance is
going to help the body.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Then six was
water and hydration.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink, drink.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And the last one was
specific supplements and herbs.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:84%
So I mentioned slippery
elm, and manuka honey,

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.980 align:middle line:90%
and probiotics, and aloe vera.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.017 align:middle line:84%
And just like finding foods
that make you feel good.

00:28:00.017 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks so much for
your time today, Kate.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me, James.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>> James here for
"Food Matters."

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.768 align:middle line:84%
