00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
It's James here
from "Food Matters,"

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and welcome to this FMTV
special interview with Ty

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Bollinger, the founder of
the "Truth About Cancer"

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:90%
docu-series.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.450 align:middle line:84%
If you have not seen this series
yet, you must check it out.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
When we first created
Food "Matters,"

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.373 align:middle line:84%
looking at the cancer
industry and a lot

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:84%
of the causative
factors of cancer

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and some of the failings of
mainstream medicine's approach

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:84%
to cancer treatment,
it's something that's

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:90%
really close to our heart.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And Ty has been an absolute
crusader in this space,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:84%
helping open up the
research and helping open up

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.300 align:middle line:90%
a lot of this information.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:84%
It's been said
that this series is

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.830 align:middle line:84%
the series that the mainstream
networks refuse to air.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And I love that about it
because it's true to its cause.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
It is really about uncovering
the best information that's

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And today, I'm
going to be having

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
a quick chat with Ty about
his journey and everything

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:90%
he's learned so far.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Ty, how are you doing?

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Good, James.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Good to see you
again, my friend.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So this was a personal
catalyst that set you off

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.452 align:middle line:84%
on this journey in creating
"The Truth About Cancer"

00:01:19.452 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
series and the whole movement
that you've made around this.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.035 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about
that, how that happened.

00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's very
personal to me.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
James, when I graduated from
Baylor University in 1991,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I never dreamed that 25 years
later I'd be doing this.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm a certified
public accountant,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
or in Australia it's a
chartered accountant.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's my education.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I figured that's
what I'd be doing.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
did do for five years

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:90%
until my dad got sick.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And in 1996, my
dad was diagnosed

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.370 align:middle line:90%
with cancer on July the 1st.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:90%
He died the 25th.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So 25 days, a man that
was 52 years old was dead.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it was that incident
and my own personal loss

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.663 align:middle line:84%
that got me questioning the
entire medical paradigm.

00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
how a man that

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:84%
was 52 years old,
seemingly healthy,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:84%
went in for what was just minor
stomach pains they thought

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
was gallbladder problems,
and they ended up

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
taking out his entire
stomach due to cancer.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
He died in a little
over three weeks

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.425 align:middle line:84%
as a result of a
botched surgery.

00:02:16.425 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the cancer,
because the initial diagnosis

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.970 align:middle line:90%
was two years.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.245 align:middle line:90%
He died in less than a month.

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't understand
how they couldn't save my dad.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And that just got me into
reading and researching

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and learning all I
could about cancer.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And what I began to
realize is that we

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.960 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of
treatments for cancer

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
that work better than what
they tell you in the hospitals,

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.588 align:middle line:84%
but they're not lucrative
because a lot of them

00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:39.130 align:middle line:84%
are herbs and foods and things
that are not patentable.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And so there's no money
in those treatments.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.240 align:middle line:90%
And that was really--

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.273 align:middle line:84%
it was enraging to
me at first because I

00:02:46.273 --> 00:02:48.190 align:middle line:84%
felt like I'd lost my
father because he didn't

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:84%
have knowledge, because
this information is

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:90%
being suppressed.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But after dad died, over
the next seven years,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
I lost both granddads, a
grandma, an uncle, a cousin,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and my mother.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So I lost my whole
family to cancer.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.818 align:middle line:90%
So it is very personal to me.

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And my whole mission, the whole
mission with "The Truth About

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Cancer," is just to get
the information out there

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
to educate people so that they
know that there are options

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:84%
if they're diagnosed
with cancer.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And then they can make
up their own mind.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.493 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great mission.

00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the experts
from the "Food Matters"

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:84%
documentary says that with
access to better information,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.460 align:middle line:84%
people invariably make better
decisions for their health.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think you look at
when somebody is diagnosed

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
with a chronic illness,
cancer specifically,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.800 align:middle line:84%
the amount of money
that gets spent is huge,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
whether it's subsidized by
the government or insurance.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.950 align:middle line:84%
But still, the out-of-pocket
expenses are very high.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:84%
For a relatively small
investment of your time

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and of money, you can uncover
some excellent resources

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:90%
to help make better decisions.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.877 align:middle line:84%
So I'm with you on
this crusade, really,

00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:84%
in helping expose this and
help more people access

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:90%
this information.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.157 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions
I had for you

00:03:53.157 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:84%
was what is your recommendations
for people when they're first

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed with cancer?

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.035 align:middle line:84%
What are your top tips for
people as a first port of call?

00:04:01.035 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, according to the
World Health Organization,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:84%
one in two men alive
today, one in three women,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
are going to face
that diagnosis.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is not just something
that happens to a few people.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
It happens to-- I guess
that boils down to about 41%

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:84%
of people alive today
are going to face cancer.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that I
recommend is don't panic.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Cancer takes a long
time to manifest itself

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:84%
in the body, years and years and
years, sometimes over a decade.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Don't panic, and don't
allow your medical doctor

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:84%
to scare you into a
treatment that you're not

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Because in light of the fact
that this cancer has taken

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
5, 6, maybe 10 years to
manifest, most cancers-- now,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.020 align:middle line:90%
some are much more fast growing.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm not discounting that.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Most cancers, though,
are slower growing.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:84%
They take a long
time to manifest.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Don't let the doctor
tell you on a Friday

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.780 align:middle line:84%
that you need to start
treatment on a Monday

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:84%
before you've had time
to do your research

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.788 align:middle line:84%
and figure out the way you
want to treat your cancer.

00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it's your body, you
should have that option.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't play into the fear.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.570 align:middle line:84%
What I would say before
that is start now,

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.120 align:middle line:84%
before you're diagnosed,
living a lifestyle

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
that's a cancer
preventative lifestyle

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't have to
even face that diagnosis.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.675 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say
try to prevent.

00:05:11.675 --> 00:05:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's not wait and treat once
you have the disease, which

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:84%
is the whole Western
medical paradigm is focused

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:90%
on treating once you get it.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not focused on
preventing because there's

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.100 align:middle line:90%
no money in prevention, James.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.325 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's not just
me being paranoid.

00:05:23.325 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not me being a
conspiracy theorist.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.153 align:middle line:84%
The United States Senate has
determined in the United States

00:05:28.153 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
active conspiracy

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.917 align:middle line:84%
to suppress cancer treatment,
natural cancer treatments.

00:05:31.917 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just me.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:90%
It's the United States Senate.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Because why?

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Because money.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.720 align:middle line:90%
So don't play into the fear.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Try to prevent.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you are diagnosed,
empower yourself

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.580 align:middle line:90%
with knowledge.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Watch our documentary.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
You can watch it
online for free.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Read books.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Empower yourself with knowledge.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And then begin a protocol that
will help you to do two things.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Detoxify while
you fill your body

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
with nutrients that will empower
your immune system to work

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:90%
the way it's supposed to.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Because cancer is
really a disease

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
of a deficiency
coupled with toxicity.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.897 align:middle line:84%
It's you're deficient in
nutrition and you're toxic.

00:06:09.897 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
So you get rid of
the toxins and begin

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
to bring in the nutrition,
and it's amazing, James.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Your body starts to heal itself.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
The body's the real
cure to cancer.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:84%
I've done these
documentaries called

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:84%
the "Quest for the Cures," but
the reality is, there's really

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:90%
not cures for cancer.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.668 align:middle line:84%
What there are are natural
substances, a whole plethora

00:06:26.668 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:84%
of natural substance,
hundreds and hundreds

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
of herbs and foods, that
give your body the fuel

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.610 align:middle line:90%
that it needs.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And it does the curing if
you give it the right fuel.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:84%
The body-- that was a big
shift that my dad made.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.175 align:middle line:84%
My dad was actually an
accountant as well in

00:06:41.175 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Australia, and he suffered
from chronic fatigue syndrome,

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:90%
depression, anxiety.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.532 align:middle line:90%
No cancer.

00:06:46.532 --> 00:06:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's had some skin
cancers topically, actually.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But his main issue was
the chronic fatigue.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And for him, once he
understood this idea

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that the body is a
self-healing mechanism,

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.370 align:middle line:84%
it completely
shifted his approach

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.662 align:middle line:84%
to how he viewed
his health and how

00:07:00.662 --> 00:07:02.120 align:middle line:84%
he approached his
condition, and we

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:84%
were able to help him
recover from that very fast.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:84%
It really is amazing
what the body can do

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle line:90%
if you give it the proper fuel.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's really funny, James.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.280 align:middle line:84%
In health, this is the only
area that we operate this way.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have somebody
that's a race car driver

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and their race car is
not running properly.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
go cut off the tire

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:84%
or take a part of the
engine out because it's not

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:90%
running properly.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make sure
that the oil is clean,

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.060 align:middle line:84%
the filters are clear,
the fuel's proper.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:90%
And then, guess what?

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:90%
The car runs.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.785 align:middle line:84%
But with the Western
medical paradigm,

00:07:36.785 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:84%
we have a body that
doesn't work properly, we

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:84%
have a problem with a
tumor in your breast,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:90%
we cut the breast off.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.822 align:middle line:84%
You have a tumor in your spleen,
we cut part of the spleen off.

00:07:46.822 --> 00:07:49.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't even look at the fuel
that's going into that body.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.113 align:middle line:84%
We don't even look to
make sure the filters,

00:07:51.113 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:90%
the lymph nodes are cleared.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.500 align:middle line:84%
We don't even look at
it the way that anybody

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.880 align:middle line:90%
would look at a car.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But they both run
on the proper fuel.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And so what we really are
aiming for-- and I know that

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.570 align:middle line:84%
you're aiming for the same
thing with "Food Matters,"

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.862 align:middle line:90%
and we love what you're doing--

00:08:03.862 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:84%
is a paradigm shift
where we're actually

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.210 align:middle line:84%
looking at the cause of
disease, and then we're

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.972 align:middle line:84%
giving the body the
fuel that it needs,

00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and it does all
the healing itself.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
It's that self-healing
mechanism that you talked about

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.700 align:middle line:90%
that we all have.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.742 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't agree more.

00:08:15.742 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot of--

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:84%
when you start to
do this research,

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:84%
one of the sad things
for me in particular,

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I can tell it's a little
bit the same for you,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
is the failings
of modern medicine

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to this epidemic.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.710 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
the big issues are

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:84%
around how modern medicine
is approaching the cancer

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.800 align:middle line:90%
epidemic?

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest
issues are twofold.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:90%
It's education and finances.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Number one, education.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.120 align:middle line:84%
When I say that, what I mean
is that, at least in the United

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:84%
States, the curriculum
for medical schools

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:90%
was co-opted 100 years ago.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So the medical
schools were basically

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:84%
bought off by the pharmaceutical
and the chemical companies.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And so now, as a
result of what happened

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
with this alliance
with big business

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago with what's
called the Flexner Report,

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.100 align:middle line:84%
all of the curriculum
in medical schools

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:84%
is drug intensive because
they were basically bought.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when a doctor goes
through medical school,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
he or she learns that
if someone's sick,

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:90%
here's a drug for that sickness.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.370 align:middle line:84%
If someone has this sickness,
here's another drug for it.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Someone has this sickness,
here's another drug for it.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that they're taught

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.558 align:middle line:84%
that is because that's
all the curriculum

00:09:12.558 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:90%
is in the medical schools.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.270 align:middle line:84%
That is what they're taught,
that that's the only way

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.170 align:middle line:90%
to treat.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:84%
They're not taught anything
holistic because the American

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Medical School--

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:84%
or the American Medical
Association in 1913

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:84%
started an active campaign to
attack all holistic physicians

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And that was where the
first use of the term

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:84%
quack in the United States,
was from the American Medical

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Association calling people that
were holistic practitioners,

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.270 align:middle line:84%
calling naturopaths or
chiropractors or herbalists,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.243 align:middle line:90%
quacks.

00:09:42.243 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So as a result, 100
years later, because

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.190 align:middle line:84%
of the fact that
this medical school

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:84%
curriculum has been bought off,
all that doctors know is drugs.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's not their fault, really.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.390 align:middle line:90%
They're genius people.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.515 align:middle line:90%
Most doctors are really smart.

00:09:55.515 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I could
get through medical school.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.977 align:middle line:90%
It's brutal.

00:09:58.977 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
really, really smart.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And they have the
right intention too.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And they have
good intentions.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:90%
They have good intentions.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.900 align:middle line:84%
But you go through
a decade of all

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.240 align:middle line:84%
you hear from what you
think are the highest

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.882 align:middle line:84%
institutions of the land telling
you that the only way that you

00:10:10.882 --> 00:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
can cure this sickness
is with this drug,

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:90%
and you begin to believe it.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.722 align:middle line:84%
Because why would they have
anything else to teach you?

00:10:15.722 --> 00:10:17.713 align:middle line:84%
Why would they be
lying to you otherwise?

00:10:17.713 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And the reality
is they don't even

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.503 align:middle line:84%
know they're lying to you,
because 100 years ago, we've

00:10:21.503 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:90%
all forgotten what happened.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And so now this is
just the gospel truth,

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
that if you have this symptom,
here's a drug to treat it.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:84%
That's all medical
doctors know, so that's

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.877 align:middle line:90%
all they can tell you.

00:10:28.877 --> 00:10:31.252 align:middle line:84%
So that's number one reason,
is that medical doctors just

00:10:31.252 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:90%
have not been taught.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we're actually
trying to re-educate them.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And you would not believe
the number of medical doctors

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that I get the privilege of
consulting with and knowing

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
as my friends that actually
go to websites like ours

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and yours to get educated,
because they're not

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.620 align:middle line:84%
getting educated in
their medical schools.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.162 align:middle line:84%
But the number two reason, and
it's maybe actually the number

00:10:52.162 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:90%
one reason, is the finances.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:90%
It's big business.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Cancer treatment
is big business.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it said
that there are more

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
people making a
living off of cancer

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.593 align:middle line:84%
than are dying from cancer,
because it's big business.

00:11:02.593 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
In the United States,
you can anticipate

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:84%
$750,000 per diagnosis to
be spent on treatments.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have that
kind of a vested interest

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:84%
from the big businesses, from
the pharmaceutical companies,

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.945 align:middle line:84%
from the vaccine manufacturers,
from the hospitals,

00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:84%
from all these
organizations that

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:90%
are pocketing a lot of cash--

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And also, when we
look at chemotherapy--

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:84%
this is a little bit
off topic, but when

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:84%
you look at chemotherapy,
it's the only set

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:84%
of drugs in the United
States that doctors

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:84%
are allowed to mark up
or get a kickback for.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:90%
They get a commission.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So doctors, oncologists,
buy chemotherapy

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.147 align:middle line:84%
at a certain price, and they
mark it up before they sell it.

00:11:37.147 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So where's the incentive to
stop treating with something

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:84%
that you can mark up 600%, 700%,
800% and make a fortune on?

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.740 align:middle line:84%
It's estimated that the
average oncologist makes more

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:84%
from kickbacks to
chemotherapy than he

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.907 align:middle line:84%
does with his regular base
salary in the United States.

00:11:51.907 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So where's the
incentive to stop that?

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>> As myself, when I start
making a documentary,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.830 align:middle line:84%
it's normally you have to follow
where the money is coming.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Follow the money.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, follow the money.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And we see instances
like Dr. Farid Fata

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:90%
in Detroit, Michigan.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.412 align:middle line:84%
He's an oncologist that now
is serving 45 years in jail.

00:12:09.412 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're
familiar with his story.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>> But he was an oncologist,
and he was he was literally

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:84%
prescribing chemotherapy to
patients at his clinic that

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:90%
didn't even have cancer.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Off-label prescribing.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Off-label prescribing.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And there were hundreds
of them that died.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>> He milked Medicare.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:90%
He billed them $245 million.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:84%
He collected $93 million
for chemotherapies

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:90%
that were not needed.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of them didn't
have cancer at all.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of them had cancer,
but he prescribed

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:84%
the wrong chemotherapy
for their type of cancer.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I would contest that
there is a right kind of--

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I would dispute whether
there actually is

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:90%
a correct type of chemotherapy.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:84%
But regardless, he
collected $93 million

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
from people that didn't
even have cancer.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And now he's serving
45 years in jail.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:84%
That just shows that
the system's broken.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:84%
You have this incentive
from oncologists

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:90%
to make money on chemotherapy.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's really-- if you can
make an extra $300,000 a year

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:84%
on prescribing chemotherapy, or
if you can actually heal people

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.720 align:middle line:84%
by helping them to change
their diet, exercise,

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.128 align:middle line:84%
and detoxify but
doesn't make any money--

00:13:14.128 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>> You've got a systemic issue.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> What's going to win?

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to natural
treatments for a cancer,

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot of your effort and work
is focused on uncovering natural

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:84%
herbs, treatments, processes
that help reverse cancer

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:90%
or prevent it.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.040 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
biggest discoveries

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:90%
you've made in your research?

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, most of the natural
treatments for cancer,

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
whether they are viral
therapy from Riga, Latvia,

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.470 align:middle line:84%
which focuses on healthy
viruses to kill cancer,

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
whether it's hyperthermia, which
focuses on heating the body up

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.180 align:middle line:84%
to kill the cancer cells,
whether it's enzyme therapy

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Gonzalez uses or used
to use before he passed away,

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:84%
whether it's mitochondrial
therapy using a ketogenic diet,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:84%
all of them that are successful,
they have one thing in common,

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:90%
and that's changing your diet.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
All of these therapies
that are successful

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:90%
realize that food matters.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.727 align:middle line:84%
That's a great name,
isn't it, Food Matters?

00:14:11.727 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:90%
But they all realize that.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.510 align:middle line:84%
You can't-- if you have
a disease that's caused

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:84%
by a deficiency in nutrition
and a toxicity that's caused

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:84%
partially by the food
that you've been eating,

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.702 align:middle line:84%
you can't turn it around
unless you change the input.

00:14:23.702 --> 00:14:26.160 align:middle line:84%
garbage in, and garbage out,
the old phrase from computers.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.555 align:middle line:84%
Well, it works
for your body too.

00:14:27.555 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got to
change that input.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.113 align:middle line:84%
And so all of the
successful therapies-- and I

00:14:31.113 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:84%
don't know that we have a lot of
time to get into the specifics,

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
but the piece of them
that's a commonality

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:84%
is that they all focus on
intaking clean foods while you

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.400 align:middle line:90%
detoxify the body.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
clean foods, I'm not

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.297 align:middle line:84%
talking about foods
that are washed off,

00:14:44.297 --> 00:14:46.980 align:middle line:84%
which you should wash your
food, but not necessarily what

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.670 align:middle line:84%
What I mean is non-GMO, organic
foods, as close to nature

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.655 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to eat meats,
they need to be clean meats.

00:14:55.655 --> 00:14:57.030 align:middle line:84%
They need to be
from animals that

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:90%
have been treated humanely.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.880 align:middle line:84%
People different whether
they're vegetarian or vegan

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:90%
or they eat meat.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.095 align:middle line:84%
But if you do eat
meat, it needs to be

00:15:02.095 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:84%
from animals that
are treated humanely,

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:84%
that are not fit antibiotics,
that are not fed growth

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
hormone, and so
forth, and that don't

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:90%
eat genetically modified foods.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have a cow
that is raised humanely

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't have any antibiotics
injected into him or her,

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:84%
but then they're grazing
on GMO corn, don't eat it,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.590 align:middle line:84%
because the cows are
what they eat too.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.035 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big
debate over that,

00:15:25.035 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want
to get into that,

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:84%
but you need to eat clean
foods, and my recommendation

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:84%
is as close to
nature as possible.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
So the farther-- the more
steps you get away from nature

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and the closer you
get to the packages

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and the boxes and the bags,
it becomes less real food.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
real food anymore.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Real food is something
that you pick.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:90%
Grandma and my granddad.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.855 align:middle line:90%
Look at our grandparents.

00:15:45.855 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
My grandparents, even the
ones that died of cancer,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.660 align:middle line:90%
they lived into their 80s.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:90%
One of them lived into her 90s.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And they died of
cancer because I

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.972 align:middle line:84%
think what happened
is the food changed,

00:15:54.972 --> 00:15:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and so they got cancer
late in their life

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.940 align:middle line:84%
because the food
changed, and they didn't

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.023 align:middle line:90%
know the food had changed.

00:15:59.023 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:90%
It tasted better.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.788 align:middle line:90%
It was more convenient.

00:16:00.788 --> 00:16:02.025 align:middle line:90%
You could nuke it.

00:16:02.025 --> 00:16:03.400 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
realize that what

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.025 align:middle line:84%
they had been doing their whole
life by growing their own food,

00:16:06.025 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:84%
picking their own food, milking
their own cows, whatever

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.433 align:middle line:90%
it might be, was nature.

00:16:10.433 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And the farther they
got away from that,

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.030 align:middle line:90%
they began to get sick too.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So go back to what the
grandparents did 100 years ago,

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and I think you're on a
good road to recovery.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you're saying
what you're saying,

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:84%
I've thought about this term
of "you are what you eat eats,"

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:90%
which is really important.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>> You are, yeah.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.800 align:middle line:90%
That was the cow.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:90%
You are what you eat eats, yeah.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to
natural therapies,

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.180 align:middle line:84%
I agree with all of
your comments there,

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:84%
but one of the big things that
I'm discovering as my research

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:84%
deepens is a lot about mindset,
the mind-body relationship,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:84%
stress reduction, emotions,
potentially trauma or emotional

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.798 align:middle line:84%
issues that
somebody's-- or fear.

00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts on that?

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Have you done much
research on that?

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.488 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually doing a lot
of research on it now.

00:16:52.488 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, 10 years ago,
15 years ago, when

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I was doing my initial
research, I literally

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:90%
thought that was hocus pocus.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:90%
But I don't anymore.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the mind, the
mindset, the emotions, stress,

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.727 align:middle line:84%
trauma, fear,
anger, joy, they all

00:17:06.727 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:84%
have different effects
on the immune system,

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and thus the
results of the body.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:90%
So we've even seen studies--

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I've read studies where
one minute of laughter

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.500 align:middle line:84%
actually stimulates your natural
killer cells, I believe it is.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So laughter makes your
immune system work better.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:84%
Fear, anger, stress reduces
your immune function

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.330 align:middle line:90%
for a period of hours.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So we know now-- we
can actually measure

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
the effect of these different
emotions on the immune system.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And we look at people
that-- and I've

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.180 align:middle line:84%
interviewed medical
doctors across the world

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.108 align:middle line:84%
with my travels,
and many of them

00:17:43.108 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:90%
have said the same exact thing.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.133 align:middle line:90%
I'll have two cancer patients.

00:17:46.133 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
They have the exact
same kind of cancer,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:90%
same stage, almost identical.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:84%
One does my treatment
and is healed.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.100 align:middle line:90%
The other doesn't make it.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.255 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:17:55.255 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that this one got
rid of their emotional baggage,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.400 align:middle line:90%
was able to clear their--

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.472 align:middle line:90%
tapping techniques.

00:18:01.472 --> 00:18:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Emotional freedom techniques.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they used, they were
able to get rid of that baggage

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
that was keeping them down,
and this one couldn't.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And so as a matter
a fact, that's

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
why, to me, it's such a
crime for an oncologist

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:84%
to look at a cancer
patient and say,

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:84%
you've got three months to
live, because we believe them

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:84%
as being these godlike
figures that have the power

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.257 align:middle line:90%
to predict the future.

00:18:22.257 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And if they tell you that you
have three months to live,

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:90%
often times, we believe it.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed doctors
that said, you know what?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I had a patient that came over
from a traditional oncologist

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and they told him they
had three months to live,

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and I cured their
cancer, and they still

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.610 align:middle line:90%
died in three months.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.535 align:middle line:84%
Because they were programmed
to die at three months

00:18:37.535 --> 00:18:40.120 align:middle line:84%
because they believed that
they would die in three months.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And the mind does have that
much of an impact on our health.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So the more I get into this,
the more I see the huge role

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:84%
that the emotions do
play and the mindset

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.800 align:middle line:84%
plays in the prevention and
the treatment of cancer.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm really glad that that's
become a big part of your work

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:84%
too, because it reminds me
of a book called "Anatomy

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.220 align:middle line:84%
of an Illness" by
Norman Cousins.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was written I
think in the '40s or '50s,

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:90%
or maybe '60s.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.733 align:middle line:84%
And he actually checked himself
out of a hospital into a hotel

00:19:06.733 --> 00:19:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and watched comedy
movies back to back.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember the story.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And he healed himself.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.015 align:middle line:90%
>> He healed himself.

00:19:12.015 --> 00:19:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, that
is such a novel idea.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.570 align:middle line:84%
What a groundbreaking
guy to do that research.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a doctor, Dr.
Francisco Contreras with

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.293 align:middle line:90%
the Oasis of Hope in Tijuana.

00:19:22.293 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed him a
couple of years ago,

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.043 align:middle line:90%
and he told me that story.

00:19:25.043 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
because of that,

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.200 align:middle line:84%
at their hospital now
they have a laughter room.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And they have--
the walls are all

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.340 align:middle line:84%
painted in fluorescent colors,
and they would play cartoons.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.757 align:middle line:84%
And the patients
just go in there,

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:90%
and they have laughter sessions.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.208 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:19:38.208 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm excited where
things are getting to.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.458 align:middle line:84%
But we still have
a long way to go.

00:19:41.458 --> 00:19:44.348 align:middle line:84%
As we get into this space we
start to live in our own bubble

00:19:44.348 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and we start to believe
that everybody has access

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to this information,
but we're really

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.610 align:middle line:90%
just touching the surface.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>> We really are.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.350 align:middle line:90%
We really are.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And the food is such an
important piece to both of us

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:90%
and to our companies.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.090 align:middle line:84%
We're really firm believers
that that's such a key.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in a hotel
like we are and we walk around

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and we see what most of the
people are still eating,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:84%
we see that we do
have a long way to go.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>> But that's a good challenge.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> But we're getting there.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we are.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>> We're getting there.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So to wrap up here, are there
any final thoughts you'd want

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.272 align:middle line:84%
to leave people with maybe that
have family members that have

00:20:12.272 --> 00:20:14.150 align:middle line:84%
cancer or they
themselves have cancer?

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.492 align:middle line:84%
And if there's any tips or
tricks, like things or foods

00:20:16.492 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:84%
that you particularly eat
every day that you're like,

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.828 align:middle line:84%
that is something
since I've learned this

00:20:20.828 --> 00:20:22.870 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to keep
eating or really focus on,

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to hear that.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:84%
I think the main thing that
I want people to focus on

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.267 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that cancer
is not a death sentence.

00:20:29.267 --> 00:20:30.850 align:middle line:84%
We're told that it's
a death sentence.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
The oncologist tells you
it's a death sentence.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:34.907 align:middle line:84%
And as we were
just talking about,

00:20:34.907 --> 00:20:36.337 align:middle line:84%
James, with the
mind involvement,

00:20:36.337 --> 00:20:38.920 align:middle line:84%
you can't believe that, because
it's not-- doctors aren't god.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what's
coming down the road.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.830 align:middle line:84%
But they do have the
ability to hurt you

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.630 align:middle line:90%
physically through your mind.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Your mind helps to
control that body,

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.038 align:middle line:84%
and you can literally
will yourself to death.

00:20:51.038 --> 00:20:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So don't believe that
cancer is a death sentence,

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:90%
because it's not.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I've done thousands,
tens of thousands

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
of hours of research,
as have you,

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.550 align:middle line:84%
as have many other
people across the globe,

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and we know that
there are literally

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.332 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of different ways
that you can naturally

00:21:04.332 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:84%
treat your cancer, and
you can turn it around.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So number one,
don't believe that.

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, number two,
as far as the foods,

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I think my daughter
is a great example.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Her name's Brianna.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:90%
She's 16 years old.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And so because she
lives in our house,

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:84%
she's hearing this
stuff all the time.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.433 align:middle line:84%
She's turned into pretty
much of a fruitarian.

00:21:23.433 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:90%
She eats fruit all the time.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, she eats some
vegetables, but mostly fruit.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.818 align:middle line:84%
And it's all raw,
and it's all organic.

00:21:28.818 --> 00:21:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't really
have a favorite food,

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I guess, but just as close
to nature as you can.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.737 align:middle line:84%
She's 16 years old, and
when most kids her age

00:21:35.737 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:84%
are going out and getting
burgers and fries,

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.850 align:middle line:84%
she makes herself up a big bowl
of strawberries, blueberries,

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.058 align:middle line:84%
blackberries, and raspberries
every night for dinner.

00:21:42.058 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:90%
So get back to nature.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find
out is that you are--

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.180 align:middle line:84%
initially, you will
find out that you

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
are addicted to the food you're
eating, because there are

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.017 align:middle line:84%
chemicals in the fast
foods and the junk foods

00:21:53.017 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:90%
that make you crave them.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But once you can
break that addiction,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:84%
you'll find out that real
food, natural food, food

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that you can pick from the
vine, taste so much better

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.780 align:middle line:84%
than anything that you
can get from a package

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:90%
or a bag or a store.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So my admonition for people
is just to get back to nature

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and to let your taste buds
adapt back to eating foods

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:90%
that are real.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, I do have a favorite food
that I eat almost every day.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:17.905 align:middle line:90%
You asked for that.

00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you got there.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.503 align:middle line:84%
>> I eat avocados like
they're going out of style.

00:22:21.503 --> 00:22:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I love avocados.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.790 align:middle line:84%
They're technically a
fruit, even though they

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
don't seem like
a fruit, but they

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:90%
do have the seed in the middle.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> They are fruit.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.753 align:middle line:90%
>> So they're great.

00:22:27.753 --> 00:22:28.630 align:middle line:90%
They have great fats.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:84%
I eat a very high-fat, high
natural fat like vegetable fat,

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:90%
diet.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Not vegetable oil, but
avocado fat, olive oil, those.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.197 align:middle line:84%
A lot of fats,
but I eat avocados

00:22:40.197 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:90%
like they're going out of style.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.897 align:middle line:90%
And I a lot of garlic.

00:22:43.897 --> 00:22:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So those are two favorites
of mine, I guess,

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:46.870 align:middle line:84%
if you're asking
for favorite foods.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Ty, you're a champion
in this space,

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.143 align:middle line:84%
and I respect you
a lot in your work.

00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think what you're
doing in the world is great,

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and I really thank you for
having the time with me today.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you, James.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Back at your, brother.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.570 align:middle line:90%
