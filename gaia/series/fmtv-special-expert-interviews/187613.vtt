00:00:15.698 --> 00:00:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here

their blog, make sure to do so.

00:00:25.757 --> 00:00:27.292 align:middle line:90%
It's hemsleyandhemsley.com.

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:90%
They're best selling authors.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:84%
They've got their own TV
channel on channel 4 in the UK,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:84%
and they're
absolutely beautiful.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:84%
tips and tricks that they
do in their day to day life

a healthier gut, and also

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:84%
maybe some ideas on how they
stay so beautiful as well.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:90%
So enjoy this interview.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>> What an intro.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] so lovely.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Did I get it right?

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> That was really nice.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> We're blushing.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're really hot.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So reading up a little bit
about your history and how you

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
got started, it seems that
it was a little bit accident,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:84%
but I always want to try to get
into the real reasons about why

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:84%
people started
doing what they do.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe accidentally
on purpose.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a funny one
because I always think it

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:90%
starts with mom.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Mom is from the Philippines, but
she's been there for 35 years.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
She still as Filipino as
when she arrived, I think.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
She really-- she was
from a big family who--

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and the Filipino culture,
they're Catholic.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:90%
They always stick together.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:90%
They always cook for each other.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:84%
You give your right
arm for your cousin.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And she really taught us
that food is the be-all.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And she hoped we'd be
doctors, so she used to say,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to feed you
for your big brains,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
so you can be doctors
and look after me.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.090 align:middle line:84%
She talked about
avocados for beauty.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
She tried to give
Jasmine an avocado

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and pass it off as ice
cream when she was younger.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:90%
And so mom--

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.483 align:middle line:90%
I guess she wasn't a fancy cook.

00:02:01.483 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:84%
She didn't cook
from recipe books.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
It was very honest, the food
that she grew up on mixed

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:90%
in with my dad--

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
our dad who's English's mom,
so there was some English food.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was all very much food
to nourish, to feel good,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:90%
to share with your family.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
was the very first

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.060 align:middle line:84%
of the beginning
of the accidents.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>> The accidents.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But you come from very
different backgrounds

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:90%
before you got into food.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think we should
also mentioned dad as well,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and mention that mom didn't
say about me being a doctor

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
She thought I'd be
a newsreader, or I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.544 align:middle line:90%
could marry Prince William.

00:02:32.544 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>> She'd be happy with
one being a doctor,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.940 align:middle line:84%
one being a newsreader--
one being a princess.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> One being a princess.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Dad, as well, was
very old-fashioned.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:84%
His family was kind
of hippie military,

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.720 align:middle line:90%
if there is such a thing.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:90%
They were travelers.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
He had this very waste not,
want not attitude as well,

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.390 align:middle line:84%
so it was quite
frugal at our house.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So even though there's this
whole supermarket ready-meal

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.950 align:middle line:84%
thing going on, it wasn't
that our parents decided

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
that home cooking was
best particularly,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.460 align:middle line:84%
or that they were going
to do it a different way.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't-- I've heard people
have stories about that,

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.030 align:middle line:84%
that their parents shunned
that modern way of eating.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.392 align:middle line:84%
It was more that
that's what they knew,

00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
and it always seemed cheaper.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, dad would--

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.293 align:middle line:84%
3/4 of an apple would
be bruised and moldy,

00:03:20.293 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and dad would find
the bit to eat.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, we grew up with
home cooking, not wasting food,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and I guess we have quite a
wide, varied palate as well,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:84%
because we traveled
quite a bit, and we

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
met many ethnic
friends and farmers who

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:90%
had new cuisines and things.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:90%
So that was really nice.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>> We spent a couple
of years in Germany,

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.897 align:middle line:84%
so we fell in love with
cabbages, sauerkraut.

00:03:44.897 --> 00:03:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sauerkraut.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>> So we had a lucky upbringing.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.895 align:middle line:90%
We didn't--

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It didn't feel
it at the time,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:84%
because we weren't
allowed crisps--

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.583 align:middle line:90%
We weren't allowed crisps.

00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:90%
We didn't go out for dinner.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We never went out
and spent money,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
so it was always
food at home, but I

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:84%
think that person
gets that because what

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.650 align:middle line:90%
we are really good at--

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Jasmine used to be called
the Leftover Queen.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Are you still called
the Leftover Queen?

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Why did I lose that title?

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.375 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you still are.

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of a thing,
now, that we say,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
that people are proud
of us to be really

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:90%
good at using up leftovers.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.785 align:middle line:84%
I think there used
to be this thing of,

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I'll just buy food every
day, or I'll go out to eat.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.218 align:middle line:84%
And now, people are really
into going into the fridge

00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and going, what can I rustle
up from what's left over?

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a real-- it's a really,
really satisfying thing,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.400 align:middle line:84%
to make a meal out of
whatever's left, bits and bobs.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll tell you what, I think
'17 or '18, I decided to plant

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:90%
vegetables in mom's garden--

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:90%
mom and dad's garden.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.452 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't remember that.

00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:38.022 align:middle line:84%
>> And, oh, it was
so much hard work.

00:04:38.022 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:84%
It makes you never want to
waste a piece of vegetable

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:90%
ever again.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I'd planted
all these Lolo Rosso

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.380 align:middle line:84%
lettuces along the borders,
and they were so pretty,

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't actually
harvest them in time,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:90%
so they all went a bit woody.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But what happened next
was Mel and I, and this--

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Sorry for this
very long story.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many ways
into to tell this answer.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're about five years,
six years difference in age,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.050 align:middle line:90%
and we--

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Mel was working,
actually, in this place.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.180 align:middle line:84%
She worked for pubs and bars for
this chain, as well as being--

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling her story.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.438 align:middle line:84%
She was brand manager for a
shoe brand when she was 19,

00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:21.730 align:middle line:90%
so she flew all over the world.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I had been
modeling on and off

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.890 align:middle line:84%
since I was about 15
years old, and I'd

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
gone to do art and
design at university,

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:90%
and then went into modeling.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was there that
I became very aware

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that there was all these
mixed messages about food.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I guess, when
you're modeling, you

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:84%
realize, very early on, how
to take care of yourself

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.290 align:middle line:90%
and also what--

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle line:84%
so I knew about sugar being
a problem 10 years ago.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm still--

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I still have to rein
in and be careful

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:84%
how we speak to people who think
that buying fizzy apple juice

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:84%
is very different to
another can of soda.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was there that I
thought, wow, this soy milk

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and this low fat
and this margarine's

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.045 align:middle line:90%
not really talking to me.

00:06:11.045 --> 00:06:12.420 align:middle line:84%
The food that I
grew up on, which

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:90%
was butter, meat on the bone--

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.610 align:middle line:84%
mom would give us
the bone marrow.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:90%
We'd eat our greens.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Lost of stews.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Lots of stews, lots of
warming foods just seem to make

00:06:21.545 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:84%
so much more sense,
and actually,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:84%
I felt the difference,
having ventured into, ooh,

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll do this new
health food bar.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.203 align:middle line:84%
And so I start to read about
all these other different ideas,

00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and many of them
were conflicting.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Some were raw, some were
meat, others were not meat,

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and I found it fascinating,
and rather than being put off,

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
I just actually really,
really enjoyed doing it.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And so that was when I started
to help people at work,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and Melissa kind
of got on board.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.820 align:middle line:84%
The rest of our
family got on board,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and then the business
basically found us.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Someone came knocking
on the door saying,

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:90%
I want what you do.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.910 align:middle line:90%
We don't do anything yet.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I want
you to look after me.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.793 align:middle line:90%
>> We said, we just cook.

00:07:00.793 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
We just cook for our
family and friends,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.615 align:middle line:84%
and they were
like, well, can you

00:07:03.615 --> 00:07:05.615 align:middle line:84%
just cook for me like I'm
your family or friend,

00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:90%
but I'll pay you?

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.282 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, OK,
let's try it for a bit,

00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:90%
and it was brilliant.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.137 align:middle line:90%
It was such great fun.

00:07:10.137 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:90%
It was so rewarding.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And then yeah, the
door kept knocking,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and it got to the stage
where we were underground.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just crazy
cooking and having

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
fun with it for about two
years, and during that time,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.112 align:middle line:84%
one of our friends and family
was saying, hang on a minute,

00:07:29.112 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
you don't have time
to help me now.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Can you just send me a recipe?

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And we said, we
don't have recipes.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
They were like, well,
start writing them up,

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.543 align:middle line:84%
as if it's just easy to
come up with a recipe.

00:07:38.543 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're like,
OK, and we started

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:84%
to pull our recipes
together, and then

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
we said, let's put
them on a blog.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And we literally googled "how
to set up a blog" one day,

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:90%
and then put it up.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:90%
And who's going to read it?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, that was the
very, very long story,

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:84%
but it very much came from, it
was something we loved doing.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:59.945 align:middle line:90%
It was how we lived.

00:07:59.945 --> 00:08:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Our friends and
family wanted it,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:84%
then their friends wanted
it, and it just rolled,

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I guess a bit like the
TV, "Food Matters."

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So people call it
bloggers and authors,

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.390 align:middle line:84%
but they don't realize that
we were actually, maybe,

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
cooking because that was when
it was all very underground

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.043 align:middle line:90%
So that's really how we started.

00:08:14.043 --> 00:08:15.085 align:middle line:90%
Very hands on, and very--

00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:16.126 align:middle line:90%
>> We didn't have a name.

00:08:16.126 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Our clients called us food
fairies because we'd turn up,

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:84%
we'd make the food, we'd
tidy up, and we'd leave.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:90%
We're very tidy, weren't we?

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:84%
That's a cool story, and it
was a little bit like us, too,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:84%
because I think about
how we made a film.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
We were googling "how
to light an interview."

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:32.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:32.502 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>> How to what?

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.159 align:middle line:90%
>> "How to light an interview."

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my gosh, yeah.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Like, "how to start a blog."

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
We had film equipment
sent to Monte Carlo.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:84%
We were living in
France at the time,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and we started-- we
quit our jobs from there

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:90%
and started filming.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the best way to do it.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:43.959 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:08:43.959 --> 00:08:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Just go all out.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Take massive action.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Great, so how
would you describe,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.710 align:middle line:84%
after all this journey
you've been through with

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:84%
the traditional foods, and
then the German sauerkraut,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and the Filipino fish and
rice, I guess, mainly--

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And then how would you
describe your nutritional

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.270 align:middle line:84%
philosophy if you had
to put it in a package?

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh, that's a hard one.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's taken us
two cookbooks and a TV

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.123 align:middle line:90%
show to try and distill it.

00:09:11.123 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been seven
years running,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:90%
and there's no three-liner.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone's like, can you
just say it in a nutshell?

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I think, in a way,
it's something

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of eating real
food and feeling your best.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.063 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
very crux of it all.

00:09:28.063 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I love about how we
were chatting before as well,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:84%
is it's finding
what works for you,

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.250 align:middle line:84%
not feeling you need
to stick in a box,

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:84%
not feeling like you
need to give a label

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:84%
or commit to something for
life because somebody wants

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.962 align:middle line:90%
you to put a label on yourself.

00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>> We're taking it right back
to basics, because from there,

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:90%
you can decide, does it suit me?

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Do I need a bit more
raw food in my day?

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to eat breakfast?

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to snack more?

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Do I need more meat?

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Do I need less fats?

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.860 align:middle line:90%
Do I need more fats?

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:90%
I think what we do is we have--

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.140 align:middle line:84%
when we're working with
our clients one on one,

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:84%
we could call on the help
of many different people.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we introduced to--

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
we had clients who thought
that cornflakes, skim

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.900 align:middle line:84%
milk, a coffee straight after
an hour and a on the treadmill

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
was the healthy way to live,
and they were exhausted.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:84%
They were mentally and
physically exhausted,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and they had weight
issues, sleep issues--

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Mood issues.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Mood issues.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
drink Diet Coke

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and felt very deprived
at birthday parties,

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
knowing that one mouthful was
on their hip, so to speak.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So that was the kind of current
thinking for the clients

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:90%
that we took on.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So we took them back to
basics with cooked foods,

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
reintroduced fats,
helped them to understand

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.090 align:middle line:84%
what real foods were,
changed their bedtimes,

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.752 align:middle line:84%
changed the water
that they drank,

00:10:50.752 --> 00:10:52.960 align:middle line:84%
changed the way that they
ate, and the relationship--

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.890 align:middle line:84%
their whole relationship
with food changed.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And also we should
say, as well, it was--

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
we started with the food, but
then because they felt so good,

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:84%
they'd come to us and say,
OK, so what next can I do?

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.103 align:middle line:90%
Or my sleep's feeling better.

00:11:06.103 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that because of the food?

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're like,
what do you think?

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And then another
thing is, it wasn't

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.288 align:middle line:90%
just what they were eating.

00:11:11.288 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:90%
It was how they were eating it.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So we'd sit down with
them, and we'd be like,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.977 align:middle line:84%
we're going to take 20
minutes, 30 minutes over this,

00:11:16.977 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:90%
and they'd be like--

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It's soup.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I always eat while
I'm on a conference call,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
or I always eat
when I'm doing this.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And we'd go, no,
let's just chill.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.202 align:middle line:84%
Let's just pick up a
spoon, put it in our mouth,

00:11:28.202 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:90%
and put the spoon down.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:90%
And they would hate it.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.300 align:middle line:90%
They'd be like--

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>> They'd really resist.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>> But so much of it
was down to the digest--

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:90%
their digestion, and they just--

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.648 align:middle line:84%
either they were
eating something

00:11:40.648 --> 00:11:41.690 align:middle line:90%
they thought was naughty.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.448 align:middle line:84%
So they'd eat it
really, really fast--

00:11:44.448 --> 00:11:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Chicken liver pate
would be one of them.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>> As if it hadn't happened.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.188 align:middle line:84%
Or it would be something
like vegetables.

00:11:50.188 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Again, they'd eat it really,
really fast to get it over

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and done with, and
it was about, again,

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:84%
taking it back to basics,
slowing down, really

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
getting what you
needed out of the food.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.722 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're just talking about
conscious eating and how a lot

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
of the things that you noticed
improved in your clients was

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.300 align:middle line:84%
their digestion, and they slept
better, and they felt better.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And how is it about the way
that we eat that affects

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:90%
our digestion and our health?

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think so many things.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I think a big one for
a lot of our clients

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.670 align:middle line:84%
was this kind of punish versus
treat mentality behind food.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So in either way they were
looking at their foods

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.670 align:middle line:84%
before they met us, perhaps,
was a bit of a rush.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a rush for the
pleasure of the ones

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:84%
they really liked, or it
was a rush for the things

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:90%
they didn't like--

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> To get it over.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Get it off their plate.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.403 align:middle line:84%
They'd eat their broccoli
first, because then they

00:12:43.403 --> 00:12:46.610 align:middle line:84%
could really focus on their
steak or whatever it was.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.412 align:middle line:84%
>> Or even, I don't really want
to eat that chocolate cake,

00:12:49.412 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
but if I do it really
quickly, it didn't exist.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And then it disappears
from all memory.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Another thing was the fact
that they were really--

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:84%
they were spending so much
time stressing about food

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
or allocating that exercise
time and all the fearful

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety around
food, but actually, they

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:84%
were spoiling the whole
experience for themselves.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they would eat their
food-- they would say to us,

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.690 align:middle line:84%
oh-- we would say,
here's some food we made.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.898 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, OK,
great, and they'd pick it up,

00:13:16.898 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and they'd go off to maybe do
a Skype call or do something.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And we'd go, hey, let's
sit down together.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's enjoy it.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.765 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
feel better from it.

00:13:23.765 --> 00:13:25.765 align:middle line:84%
And another thing, as
well, was the satisfaction

00:13:25.765 --> 00:13:29.380 align:middle line:84%
they associated around
maybe this bowl of soup that

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:84%
looked like nothing or
looked like a starter.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And they'd start to eat
it, and after 20 minutes,

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:35.470 align:middle line:90%
it was just right.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
It was the perfect
amount of food for them,

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:84%
but had they just
inhaled it, they'd

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:84%
have gone, right, what's
next, or what, that's

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:46.120 align:middle line:84%
just a bowl of soup, where's the
bread, where's the main course.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I was listening.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Sorry.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.940 align:middle line:90%
I suddenly got really hot.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.115 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking
a bit earlier,

00:13:55.115 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:84%
before we started filming,
about whether it was, in a way,

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:90%
mindful eating.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But we couldn't really use that
word back then because they

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:90%
hadn't--

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:08.340 align:middle line:84%
these are people who did calorie
burning in the gym, not yoga.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:84%
It was-- we were working with,
yeah, a different set of--

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The word mindful might
have just gone, whoa,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:84%
too much for them, because one
thing that we found, really,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
maybe you, too-- from
working with clients,

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:84%
writing books, blogging, it's
about taking really small steps

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.013 align:middle line:84%
with people, or
saying to people,

00:14:28.013 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
take whatever small step
you want to take from this.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Take what you want
from this, really.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Not going, you need
to do this, or you

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.317 align:middle line:84%
need to do that, or
throwing too much at first.

00:14:37.317 --> 00:14:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So with our clients,
as well, we started off

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
by just simply
cooking for them as

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:84%
if they were our boyfriend
or our friend or our mom.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.328 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
to sleep better,

00:14:46.328 --> 00:14:47.370 align:middle line:90%
and their moods improved.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Their energy improved.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.910 align:middle line:84%
One client said, my wife said
to me that I'm a nicer husband.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
they go, OK, what's next?

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.942 align:middle line:84%
And then they say, oh, well,
I go to the gym, and I box,

00:14:58.942 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:90%
and I run, and I do all this.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.950 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And we'd say, oh, well, we do
yoga, and they'd be like, hm.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe after a week
of eating, feeling better,

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:84%
sleeping better, they'd go,
OK, can I try your yoga person.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Can I come with you?

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, slowly, the
different ways that we live

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.447 align:middle line:90%
started to go into them.

00:15:16.447 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the day that
a client said, oh, so what's

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:90%
this meditation thing about?

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Bingo.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>> And he came to it himself.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
We didn't say,
hey, you know what?

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:25.920 align:middle line:90%
You're eating better.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.408 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you do meditation now?

00:15:27.408 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the best way to
do these things is to almost

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.250 align:middle line:84%
introduce it like
it's their idea.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:90%
So often, we'll have clients--

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.640 align:middle line:90%
we some of our clients still.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:90%
We catch up.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:84%
They'll be in another
country eating

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.050 align:middle line:84%
an incredible bowl of food,
and they'll text it to us.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll say, I really
want a recipe for this.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Can you make something?

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll start
telling you about something

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:84%
they're doing that you
introduced to them a while

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.065 align:middle line:84%
back, but it's become such
a part of their routine,

00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and they've then gone on to
tell other people about it,

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.240 align:middle line:84%
they kind of think
it's their idea.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, wow, that's amazing
because some of our clients

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:90%
were celebrities.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:84%
They had worked with personal
trainers, maybe dietitians

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and nutritionists,
or other people,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and the focus was
always lose weight.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And then they got
to a place where

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
they would be maybe
jumping between retreats

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:16.963 align:middle line:90%
and on smoothies--

00:16:16.963 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Living like a monk.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Living like a monk, and then
coming back to London and being

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:84%
on coffee, fast
food, and cigarettes.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And they just couldn't--
they're yo-yoing.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:84%
They knew there was
something out there for them.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So we introduced this
loving bone broth

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
cooked foods, introduced
digestion, and chewing slowly.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.885 align:middle line:84%
And you were saying,
how important is that?

00:16:34.885 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think, because
we couldn't really

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.252 align:middle line:84%
use this word "mindful"
and "connecting"

00:16:38.252 --> 00:16:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and that type of thing, we just
told them that actually all

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:41.877 align:middle line:90%
the pleasure's in the mouth.

00:16:41.877 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So you call yourself
a foodie, but you

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:90%
seem to dump it straight in.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:84%
What's the point of going
to a five star restaurant

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.520 align:middle line:90%
and literally inhaling?

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And then just describing how
you're preparing your stomach.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:84%
You're sending
signals to your body,

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and satisfaction
comes from this,

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and helping them to
understand, to see

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.990 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
feeling really satisfied

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.272 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
get up and move on,

00:17:06.272 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:84%
unless you live in a
country where you're

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.690 align:middle line:90%
fortunate to have a siesta.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:13.117 align:middle line:84%
And the difference between
feeling like, I'm stuffed,

00:17:13.117 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I can't move, because
that's something

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:84%
that I encountered all the
time in my line of work.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.960 align:middle line:84%
People would literally
talk from breakfast

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.520 align:middle line:84%
to lunch about how
hungry they are.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:90%
What is it they're going to eat?

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Does anyone know
what the food is?

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.588 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to order?

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:28.922 align:middle line:84%
And 20 minutes later,
they are exhausted,

00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and they need a coffee
to cut through it,

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:90%
so it's this extremes.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And so we talked about
staying on a lovely even keel

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.290 align:middle line:90%
and being able to listen inside.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:84%
A big part of the message
that I'm getting here,

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:84%
of your core story, I
guess, around nutrition

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and helping people, is
focusing on gut health.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of scientists
catching up now,

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
with the microbiome, and
the gut-brain connection,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.108 align:middle line:84%
and we're understanding
more about how this works.

00:17:54.108 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:84%
What are your biggest
tips for people

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
to improve their digestion
and improve their gut health,

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.605 align:middle line:84%
whether it's food based
tips, types of foods,

00:18:01.605 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:90%
the way they approach food?

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:84%
How would you try
to distill that?

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to quickly
say about the gut thing,

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.268 align:middle line:84%
because you can imagine, if
you can't say the word mindful,

00:18:08.268 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:84%
trying to use the word "gut"
with clients who just think

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.270 align:middle line:90%
of it as a--

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>> A dirty word.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>> A dirty word.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Or private word.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We'd say to them, how
are your number twos?

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.180 align:middle line:90%
Do you say that--

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.250 align:middle line:90%
number twos?

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.998 align:middle line:90%
And fine, fine, fine.

00:18:22.998 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Stop talking
about my number twos!

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And then after about
four days, I said,

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:90%
can we just talk about my poo?

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.760 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they just
see such a difference.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.920 align:middle line:84%
They almost didn't think there
was a problem before, and then

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, they know what it's
like to feel really, really

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's quite a thing
for a lot of people,

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:84%
because if you're hitting
rock bottom with your health,

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:90%
you're willing to try anything.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you're someone
that thinks you're fine--

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:84%
got a headache,
yeah, pop a pill.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:48.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll move on.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm really tired.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll just do
a couple of coffees,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'll deal with the
rest of the fallout later.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.065 align:middle line:84%
When you can actually
help those people

00:18:55.065 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:84%
before they hit
rock bottom, it's

00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:90%
a lovely feeling because they--

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.290 align:middle line:84%
it just shows how subtle
these things can be,

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:05.645 align:middle line:90%
but how big the impact is.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:90%
What were you saying?

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Best thing's--

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Best thing.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Tips-- forgot how.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I think a big one is, what
we mentioned before, is

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
slowing down, taking time
over your food, chewing.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Going back to mom,
our mom used to say,

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:84%
constantly-- she
still does actually--

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:90%
chew, chew, chew, yes, chew.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Roll it around your mouth,
is what she used to say.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And she also used to say to
us, don't distort your mouth,

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.053 align:middle line:84%
and what she meant by that was,
don't hamster cheek your food,

00:19:35.053 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:84%
so don't put it over in
your mouth and go like that.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So as we were
growing up, yeah, we

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:84%
had this mom who
would watch us eating.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But she was completely right
because people that eat--

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:90%
when you see someone going--

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
a bowl of kale, or especially
if it's the massage kale,

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.002 align:middle line:84%
it's raw, and they're inhaling
it, and I think, oh, my gosh,

00:19:55.002 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
farting so much later.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
That is not going to
be a pleasurable thing.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So a big thing-- taking your
time, chewing really well.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:84%
As boring as it sounds,
you'd have to make it boring.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if everyone just
used to be the slowest

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.325 align:middle line:90%
person at the table--

00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I am still really slow.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.472 align:middle line:84%
>> But actually,
if you slow down,

00:20:11.472 --> 00:20:13.930 align:middle line:84%
you can tend to have quite a
positive influence on everyone

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.390 align:middle line:84%
else at your table
to slow down, too,

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.340 align:middle line:90%
so they'd be some big ones.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Another one, we were talking
to you earlier-- broth.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.600 align:middle line:84%
We always talk to
people about broth.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
We have these really,
really funny tote bags,

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:84%
that I laugh when I see
someone on the tube--

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Should have brought you one.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we should
have brought you one.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:90%
We'll send.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll send.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>> --or a farmer's market, and
it says, "boil your bones."

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.695 align:middle line:84%
We don't-- that was just a
catchy thing, but really,

00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:90%
we're simmering them.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a long, slow simmer.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And I know, in Australia, when
we came to Sydney actually

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.650 align:middle line:84%
earlier in the year, we got sent
bone broth to our hotel room

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.780 align:middle line:84%
by someone because they
knew we loved broth.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.160 align:middle line:90%
That was incredible.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Bone broth ice lollies
as well, or popsicles,

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I think you call them.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.625 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so the gut health
thing was where we really

00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
came from when we first started
to work with our clients.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.490 align:middle line:90%
So it was all cooked foods.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:01.540 align:middle line:90%
It was all warming.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It was all-- we told
them don't bother

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:90%
exercising through this time.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Pamper yourself.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:90%
Have long baths.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:90%
We're here to look after you.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, cooked foods
are much, much, much easier

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:84%
to digest, and
training someone to eat

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:84%
a bowl of soup over
25 minutes suddenly,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.060 align:middle line:84%
when they're faced
with a smorgasbord

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.220 align:middle line:84%
of cooked and raw foods, they're
suddenly going to realize,

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
oh, I really do
have to slow down.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things we say
is, if, when you swallow it,

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.420 align:middle line:84%
you still know what it is,
you didn't chew it enough.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you still know
what you're eating,

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:84%
you swallowed a
chunk of broccoli,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:84%
you need to really make it
into soup in your mouth.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So is it that old saying of,
chew your drink and drink

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:90%
your food.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know that one?

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know it?

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Chew your drink and
drink your food?

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>> So even, say, a smoothie--

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, chew your smoothie.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that,
chew your smoothie.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And to drink your food means
break it right down into soup.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:04.868 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're-- the saliva,
that's what your teeth are for.

00:22:04.868 --> 00:22:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going
slowly, and you're not just

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.130 align:middle line:90%
shoving it into your stomach.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So smoothies and
juices as well, you've

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.825 align:middle line:90%
got to mix it with saliva.

00:22:13.825 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:90%
You've got to slow it down.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:90%
It is a meal.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:84%
There is-- it's got
nutrients in it.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not just water.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:84%
But even water,
we say, don't just

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:84%
throw it in and
throw it in cold.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think not having
harsh temperature changes,

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.500 align:middle line:84%
so ice cream can be an
irritant for some people.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:90%
Eating regularly.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Eating slowly
because sometimes we

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.577 align:middle line:84%
eat-- we just eat with our
eyes, and we're convinced

00:22:34.577 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:84%
this is my normal
dinner portion.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.005 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, you just
don't need that much.

00:22:38.005 --> 00:22:40.456 align:middle line:90%
Other days, you need double.

00:22:40.456 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Eating early, so you
leave plenty of time

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:90%
to digest before bed.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:84%
We prefer to have a steak
or any kind of meat dishes

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
at lunchtime rather
than in the evening,

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:84%
unless it's like a bone
broth based vegetable soup.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:84%
We're really into activating
pulses and pseudo cereals

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:90%
to make them easier to digest.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.868 align:middle line:90%


00:23:06.868 --> 00:23:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you give me
examples of what--

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.375 align:middle line:90%
>> For example, so--

00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Quinoa, amaranth.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Mung beans.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:14.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Mung beans.

00:23:14.747 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you use rice as well?

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So we don't use
them in our recipes.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.337 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're mainly grain
free, you would say?

00:23:20.337 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>> We're grain free, yeah.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:84%
We eat pseudo
cereals and pulses.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's not paleo,
and that's why

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:84%
it's actually so difficult
to say what we do,

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:90%
because there's no one label.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.863 align:middle line:84%
But we've found that, when
we just removed from--

00:23:31.863 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:84%
well, it started
with the clients,

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and then it went onto
the food philosophy.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Just by cutting out,
or providing recipes

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:84%
that don't rely on
three things that

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:84%
are prevalent in modern
eating, which is grains,

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle line:84%
usually found in
their refined forms,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.910 align:middle line:84%
vegetable oils that
are highly refined,

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and sugar, which
has gone from being

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:84%
an expensive treat to freely
abundant and in everything.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.157 align:middle line:84%
So what we've done
is we provided

00:23:56.157 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:84%
a way of eating that doesn't
rely on those three things,

00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:59.948 align:middle line:84%
so that when you
are out and about,

00:23:59.948 --> 00:24:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
your kitchen at home,

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and you grab artisanal
bread, and you

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.828 align:middle line:84%
have some rice with your curry,
and you have this and that,

00:24:06.828 --> 00:24:09.030 align:middle line:84%
you're not overloaded
with those grains.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're the same
wheat as the main thing.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.673 align:middle line:84%
We tend to eat the
same type of wheat

00:24:16.673 --> 00:24:18.215 align:middle line:84%
for breakfast, lunch,
dinner, snacks.

00:24:18.215 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Toast in the morning.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Toast.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE]
lunch, sandwiches.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Pizzas, pastries,
patisseries.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:28.880 align:middle line:90%
So yeah--

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And another thing, you
need to go to our cafe.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:90%
We're going to send you there.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.235 align:middle line:84%
But two of the top
sellers in our cafe

00:24:35.235 --> 00:24:37.280 align:middle line:84%
are our sauerkraut
and our kimchi.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:84%
People absolutely
love it, and we're

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.220 align:middle line:84%
starting to see more and
more now places offering

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:84%
a jar of sauerkraut or kimchi
that you can add to your food.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And we say to people as
well, broth and sauerkraut

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.240 align:middle line:90%
and kimchi--

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:84%
people often think--
a lot of people

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:90%
won't drink a green juice.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just too crazy
a taste for them,

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.552 align:middle line:90%
and they're not used to it.

00:24:56.552 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But when you have something
like sauerkraut or kimchi

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:90%
or a broth, it's so delicious.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:84%
People don't think,
I'm eating something

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
because I know it's good for me,
or it's going to help my gut.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm eating it because it's--

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:84%
when you put kimchi on a bowl of
buckwheat noodles or sauerkraut

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:84%
with some sausages, it's
just absolutely delicious.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Same with the broth.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.400 align:middle line:84%
A soup-- the most
delicious soup that's

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:84%
not made with a
broth versus the soup

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.270 align:middle line:84%
made with broth, it's
just outstanding,

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and the satisfaction
levels as well,

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and how it keep you
feeling amazing.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Awesome, so mindful
eating, chewing.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Chewing.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Broths.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Fermented foods.

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:90%
And what was your other one--

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:90%
no sugar and no grains.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>> And also [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>> And soaking your pulses.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Soaking your pulses--

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>> And pseudo grains.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.680 align:middle line:90%
And when to eat?

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
What is your time clock
for how you would approach?

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, in an ideal
world, people that travel--

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Mel and I were--

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:90%
we really--

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It was six months of
just living in jet lag.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> When you sleep after a 7:00
PM dinner, the sleep is just--

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:90%
there's no comparison.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.100 align:middle line:84%
You just sleep so
well and so deeply

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.290 align:middle line:90%
because you're not digesting.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, if
we're out, we go for dinner,

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's not ideal in
terms of digestion,

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:17.550 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
stress about that.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So we actually created 15
pillars in our second book,

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:84%
"Good and Simple," to really
make it very easy for everybody

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.180 align:middle line:84%
to understand what we're
about, seeing at we

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:84%
couldn't do the three-liner
or the one-liner,

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:90%
so they could glance over it.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.400 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
one at the bottom

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.442 align:middle line:90%
was the Better Than rule.

00:26:32.442 --> 00:26:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's just doing what
you can when you can.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:84%
When you know better, you
do better, but there is--

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:90%
we know.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're not just--

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.442 align:middle line:84%
from doing food, we
know that's not--

00:26:43.442 --> 00:26:44.900 align:middle line:84%
food is not the be
all and end all.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.370 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely the attitude to
food and how you feel about it.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And we say to people, you will
get far more from a fast food

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:59.120 align:middle line:84%
burger chewed slowly and enjoyed
than you will from the biggest

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:04.008 align:middle line:84%
rainbow of vegetables and quinoa
and all kinds on your plate

00:27:04.008 --> 00:27:06.050 align:middle line:84%
if you're rushing, and
you're stressing about it.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:90%
I really believe that.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
You just have to travel and
see the poorest people and what

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:84%
they eat, and they're
thriving on something else.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot more out
there than just the food,

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:19.700 align:middle line:84%
but the food is
a fantastic place

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:84%
to start because you
eat three times a day.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:84%
It's something that you
can kind of control.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, our books
are more geared

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:84%
to people who do cook
their food and have access

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and now may be looking
after families.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing is
giving them a guiding--

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>> A helping hand.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>> A helping hand because we've
got people who follow us who

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:43.850 align:middle line:84%
are everything from vegan,
vegetarian, real food, paleo.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:47.690 align:middle line:84%
We had one lovely lady
who called and said,

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm vegan, my husband's paleo,
and the children are messed up,

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:90%
and your book helps us.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And just trying to shift
that thing, because it's--

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.430 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing
is not-- yeah, we

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:84%
have some kale salads, which
the Brits don't love the greens.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:04.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the history of
it, and we're very scared

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:90%
of anything cauliflower.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
But we're not all about
green smoothies and juices.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.500 align:middle line:84%
We're about soups and
stews, and that's things

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:84%
that people two
generations ago grew up on.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we got in
there just at a time

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.610 align:middle line:90%
when it's not completely alien.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.670 align:middle line:90%
I remember talking to a runner.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.220 align:middle line:84%
He does-- what's the
one where you go--

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Cross country.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Cross country,
that kind of thing.

00:28:27.562 --> 00:28:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Or steeple chase?

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's-- yeah,
it's cross country.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Trail running.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Trail running.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And he was just saying,
oh, my knees, and this,

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.180 align:middle line:90%
and my digestion, and all--

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and he's living off these
energy gels and things.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, he just breaks
out the next day in spots,

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:84%
and he has all kinds
of stomach issues.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was in his 20s, and
I mentioned bone broth,

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and you could just see this
mix of horror on his face.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:54.855 align:middle line:84%
The word bones, the
word broth-- sounds

00:28:54.855 --> 00:28:55.980 align:middle line:90%
like a bit like a cauldron.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:90%


00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.070 align:middle line:84%
We've become so
distanced from our food,

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and I think that is the
biggest problem, because we

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.790 align:middle line:84%
say to people, if you grew
the food in your garden,

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.960 align:middle line:84%
you had a farm next to you,
don't you need our book.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- our book
is a way of cutting

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.675 align:middle line:84%
through all the different
ideas that have come up

00:29:15.675 --> 00:29:18.660 align:middle line:84%
in a time when there are now
guidelines on how to eat,

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and those guidelines
serve many purposes.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.540 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So we've been talking a
lot about food, gut health,

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:84%
digestion, but there's this
paralleling story about mind

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:90%
and body connection.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about
some of the practices

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.970 align:middle line:84%
that you do yourselves
or recommend to others

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:40.505 align:middle line:84%
for calming the mind,
calming the body.

00:29:40.505 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Because we know, when
you're in a calm state,

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.870 align:middle line:84%
you digest better, you
approach life better.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:47.720 align:middle line:84%
You're a cool person as opposed
to being constantly in a--

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Wound up tight.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:49.265 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Big time.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me about this one.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that just came
straight into my brain was--

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who coined
the phrase, but I always

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.265 align:middle line:84%
think of Arianna Huffington
when I think about it--

00:29:59.265 --> 00:30:00.890 align:middle line:90%
is the digital detox.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So it is getting rid of your
laptops, your TV, your phones,

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:90%
any kind of-- any stimulant--

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.870 align:middle line:84%
whether they're a good one or
a bad one, any kind of anxiety

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:15.260 align:middle line:84%
around sitting and
eating your meal.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:17.792 align:middle line:84%
I even love-- one of the
things I love about cooking,

00:30:17.792 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and I know not
everyone's the same,

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.085 align:middle line:84%
is the act of
preparing the food,

00:30:21.085 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:84%
even if it's just
a little thing,

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.730 align:middle line:84%
because actually a lot of the
food I eat is from the freezer.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:90%
So I love soups, stews, dals.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Jazz is the same.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.672 align:middle line:84%
That's what a lot
of our recipes are.

00:30:29.672 --> 00:30:31.603 align:middle line:84%
So really, I've
just taken something

00:30:31.603 --> 00:30:33.770 align:middle line:84%
out the freezer in the
morning, I've let it defrost,

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.390 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just heating up.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, that-- when you
turn the heat up, and the smell

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.990 align:middle line:84%
starts coming, and that
starts to instantly calm me.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So I think even if you're
reheating something,

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:84%
or you're buying a really good
quality ready meal, but the act

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:84%
of heating it, preparing it,
making it look a bit attractive

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:90%
on your plate--

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we are very rustic.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:57.260 align:middle line:90%
We're no Ottolenghis.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:84%
We actually joke, if we put some
pomegranate seeds on things,

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:84%
we go, oh, we're
being all Ottolenghi.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.930 align:middle line:90%
But it does help.

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.580 align:middle line:84%
It helps you take your meal
a bit more seriously in a fun

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.380 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Connect with
your food as well.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and that
instantly will--

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.020 align:middle line:90%
I put the laptop away.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:90%
I start making the food.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.740 align:middle line:90%
My stress levels or my--

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.110 align:middle line:84%
not mega stress, but my
kind of "I'm working"

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.800 align:middle line:84%
stress levels go down
within that half an hour,

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.160 align:middle line:84%
to then enjoy my meal and
have it sit really nicely.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the big
one-- digital detox.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, I love that it's--

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.260 align:middle line:84%
we're moving into a time now
when people are saying, OK,

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.540 align:middle line:90%
the gut's a second brain.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.468 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it might
even be the first one.

00:31:34.468 --> 00:31:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we find out
that more messages are

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.330 align:middle line:84%
sent from the gut
than the brain,

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and the gut is bigger
than the brain,

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and then you just have to
look at these old sayings,

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:90%
like gut instinct, and--

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Listen to your gut.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Listen to your gut.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got tea towels
saying "get with your gut."

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Butterflies, all those--

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.732 align:middle line:90%
we say them.

00:31:53.732 --> 00:31:55.940 align:middle line:84%
We talk about vibes-- oh,
I got bad vibes from them--

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.720 align:middle line:84%
but we don't really think
about what that means.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you
realize that this

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:90%
is how we were back in the day.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.850 align:middle line:84%
This is all we had to go
on, as much as anything.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Everything else can
change in a moment,

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and yet we tend to rely on outer
forces or ideas to mold us.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.490 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's--

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:24.440 align:middle line:84%
for us, meditation has been
a massive influence on us,

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.720 align:middle line:84%
saying it's on
par with the way--

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.910 align:middle line:84%
changing the way
we eat, if not more

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.495 align:middle line:84%
because it can kind of
override everything.

00:32:31.495 --> 00:32:32.870 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like--
for me, I feel

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:35.465 align:middle line:90%
like it's a secret tool I have.

00:32:35.465 --> 00:32:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happens,
I've got this in my--

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Superpower.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's a superpower.

00:32:40.645 --> 00:32:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So even when, those
times you're flying,

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.082 align:middle line:84%
and you get no
sleep on a flight,

00:32:44.082 --> 00:32:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and you know you've got
to get up the next day,

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and you know you can just
think yourself better.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's--

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was a born
worrier, and I think

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.360 align:middle line:90%
that has helped me massively.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I was also the most brilliant
cat napper, and then as soon

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.940 align:middle line:84%
as the business
started, and we were

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:84%
looking after clients 24/7,
being able to nap went out

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:05.690 align:middle line:90%
the window.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But I've got meditation,
and in meditation, it's

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:84%
working no matter what I do, as
long as I intend to meditate,

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.060 align:middle line:90%
and so been brilliant.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.520 align:middle line:84%
But also the mind-gut
thing, I think,

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.600 align:middle line:84%
is great because it means you
can go at everything from two

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:90%
areas.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So you're sitting
there, you're faced

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:84%
with something that's probably
going to blow you apart

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:25.960 align:middle line:90%
when you eat it.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's at a friend's
house, and you want to be--

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and so just using your mind,
you can make it great for you.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Or you're having
a terrible time.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:37.460 align:middle line:90%
You've had a bad day.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.200 align:middle line:84%
You've had no
sleep, and you know

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.530 align:middle line:84%
you can cook yourself something
that can make all better

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:90%
and go to bed early.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's
such a nice feeling,

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to know we're not
reliant necessarily

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.320 align:middle line:84%
on medicine from outside
or from other people

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.450 align:middle line:90%
to make us feel better.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.060 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So you two are both
very beautiful.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And--

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sweaty.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think--
yeah, it's hot.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.580 align:middle line:90%
It's hot.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
how you eat or how

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.710 align:middle line:84%
you approach food affects your
skin, affects your vibrancy,

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.650 align:middle line:90%
affects your hair?

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.639 align:middle line:90%
And tell me about--

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, Mel's 90, and I'm 96.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we're all girls.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:20.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, when we're really--

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:21.670 align:middle line:90%
simple things.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I remember, when we write the
books, you get so into it,

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:26.867 align:middle line:84%
you're almost chained to
the laptop a little bit,

00:34:26.867 --> 00:34:28.909 align:middle line:84%
especially when you get
into the editing process.

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And you might still
be eating lovely food,

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.878 align:middle line:84%
but you might be rushing
at that a bit more,

00:34:32.878 --> 00:34:35.420 align:middle line:84%
or you're kind of, oh, just get
to this bit before I have it.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.929 align:middle line:84%
So you leave your food,
or you don't get outside

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:39.730 align:middle line:90%
for five seconds.

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And then within a
week, maybe, you

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.920 align:middle line:84%
can start to feel that
things aren't quite right,

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.500 align:middle line:84%
or not feeling as good,
or not looking as good.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.873 align:middle line:84%
And then conversely,
you go away on holiday,

00:34:50.873 --> 00:34:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and you get out and get some
vitamin D-- it might not even

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.510 align:middle line:84%
be a sunny day, but
it's a bright day.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:57.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not raining.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:02.440 align:middle line:84%
You're outside, and you feel so
much better straight from it.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.060 align:middle line:90%
We have people who--

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:84%
a lot of our clients, when we
started with them, it almost

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:09.550 align:middle line:84%
was by the third day that
we'd get the text or the phone

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.150 align:middle line:90%
call going, I'm on board.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:15.805 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the first couple of
days, they'd be a bit grisly.

00:35:15.805 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>> How many calories
are in this?

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, worried,
anxious grisly.

00:35:19.623 --> 00:35:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you sure I'm
supposed to be eating fat?

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Not eating their coffee.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Not having their evening treat.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Not having their, whatever
it was that-- their crux.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Third day, they'd
be feeling amazing.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:30.880 align:middle line:90%
I remember-- who was it?

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Someone said, after
two weeks, they went,

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:41.050 align:middle line:84%
someone commented on my skin,
and she's a 50-year-old lady.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said, someone
I hadn't seen for ages

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.240 align:middle line:84%
commented on my skin
after two weeks.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.960 align:middle line:84%
She was having a lot of
broth and a lot of soups.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So not only the food that
you're eating and cooking

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.722 align:middle line:84%
as part of a meal or something,
it's also the products

00:35:54.722 --> 00:35:56.430 align:middle line:84%
that you use, and
people start to go, oh,

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:57.972 align:middle line:84%
what have you got
in your makeup bag?

00:35:57.972 --> 00:36:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Or when they go to
use your toilet, what

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.280 align:middle line:90%
have you got in here?

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.590 align:middle line:90%
And we are--

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:06.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.682 align:middle line:84%
It's something to do with--
we are multi-purpose girls.

00:36:08.682 --> 00:36:10.950 align:middle line:90%
We like things that do a lot.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.720 align:middle line:90%
So your coconut oil--

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.750 align:middle line:84%
we all know that good to fry in,
good to bake with, and so on.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.660 align:middle line:90%
But it's really good for hair.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.360 align:middle line:84%
It's great for
removing eye makeup.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.310 align:middle line:90%
It's good for dry bits.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.370 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing more and
more now, England,

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:29.130 align:middle line:84%
big time in the last
year, these new brands

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:33.990 align:middle line:84%
coming on board,
your almond oil based

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:90%
body oils coming on board.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.860 align:middle line:84%
People talking about
apple cider vinegar

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:42.380 align:middle line:84%
for putting on some spots
or something like that.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Turmeric.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>> The coconut oil.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Turmeric facemasks, which
can get a bit messy,

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.330 align:middle line:90%
but are effective.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Avocado face masks.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe oat scrubs, or
something like that.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, sea salt baths,
putting ginger in the water,

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.380 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.628 align:middle line:90%
So I think there's lots of--

00:36:58.628 --> 00:36:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, a ginger bath is lovely.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's lots of old
school things that you had

00:37:02.455 --> 00:37:04.830 align:middle line:84%
to do when they didn't-- you
couldn't just go out and buy

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.570 align:middle line:90%
products.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I like to, have--
after, if I had an avocado,

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I like to get the scrapings
and use that on my face

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.480 align:middle line:84%
rather than mash up an entire
avocado and put it on my face.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Expensive.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>> They're pricey out here.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Or even a papaya skin or
something like that, you

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:21.330 align:middle line:90%
can just lay that on your face.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:24.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think the biggest
one has to be, we

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.800 align:middle line:90%
know about hydration and sleep.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, there's
been some heavy moments

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.000 align:middle line:90%
in the last couple of years--

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this year,
we opened our cafe,

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.417 align:middle line:84%
launched our second cookbook,
and did a TV series.

00:37:39.417 --> 00:37:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So I think, safe to
say, there's a few times

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I looked in the mirror,
and I was pretty horrified.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how just
sleep fixes all that,

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and also knowing that
you're not the same person

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:52.740 align:middle line:90%
in a couple of years.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Every body part
renews, so you just

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.410 align:middle line:84%
have to put a little
bit of work in.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Have a bit of sleep,
and sleep's free.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.130 align:middle line:90%
No one likes to do it.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.040 align:middle line:90%
We have FOMO--

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> So much to do.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Fear Of Missing Out,
that we push sleep away.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.073 align:middle line:84%
We convince ourselves that
things are more important.

00:38:09.073 --> 00:38:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Or we say that we
can catch up on it.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but sleep is just
the number one for everything,

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:19.530 align:middle line:84%
and I love knowing that we are--
how many percentage bacteria?

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are 10 trillion
bacteria versus one trillion

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.600 align:middle line:84%
cells, so a 10 10x bacteria
over cells in our body.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>> And then we're-- how many--

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:28.350 align:middle line:90%
70% water.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And so just knowing all these
things, you don't think,

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.280 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm stuck with
this old carcass,

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.360 align:middle line:90%
and I can't do anything.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.080 align:middle line:84%
There is-- I remember one
a meditation teacher said,

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.460 align:middle line:84%
so this shirt that I bought last
year is older than my liver.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking, huh,
are trying to work it out.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, because
everything-- an organ has--

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:51.263 align:middle line:84%
obviously not wanting
to break everything down

00:38:51.263 --> 00:38:52.680 align:middle line:84%
into systems and
organs and parts,

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.430 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
involved with each other.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But just knowing
that you can repair.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:59.910 align:middle line:84%
You just have to put
the intention there.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Ask for a little bit
of help from someone,

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.130 align:middle line:84%
put in a little bit of effort,
and suddenly, hopefully,

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:07.555 align:middle line:90%
come out the other side.

00:39:07.555 --> 00:39:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, ladies.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.756 align:middle line:90%
Been amazing.

00:39:08.756 --> 00:39:09.631 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:39:09.631 --> 00:39:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So fun, and you survived
the heat in this room.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, my gosh, have
we measured this heat?

00:39:14.675 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Have we measured this heat?

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like 45 degrees
in here, isn't it?

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Pretty much.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm off to India
tomorrow, so [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>> You're preparing.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:20.910 align:middle line:90%
You're preparing.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, ladies.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, thank you.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:24.450 align:middle line:90%
So good.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:27.000 align:middle line:90%
