00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:12.175 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:14.123 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.123 --> 00:00:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Jonny Enoch and this
is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever looked
into a night sky,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:10%
mesmerized by that beautiful
sea of sparkling lights,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.200 align:middle line:10%
or made a wish upon
a falling star?

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors knew the sky was
the realm of the almighty gods

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.560 align:middle line:90%
and heavenly potentates.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:84%
The powerful movement
of celestial bodies

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.350 align:middle line:84%
across the heavens, personified
in the solar pageantry,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:90%
became the fabric of our lives.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.240 align:middle line:84%
This fascination
with heavenly motion

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:90%
taught us how to tell time.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:10%
And it was the root
of the creation

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:10%
of the symbols for the
Arabic numbers used

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:10%
to this day in mathematics.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the word "algebra"
comes from the Arabic word

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:10%
"al-jabr," which most of the
brightest stars have Arabic

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:10%
names.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:84%
As with Arabic numerals,
almost every major religion

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and all of our myths and legends
are based on astrotheology.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.655 align:middle line:84%
This all seems to be under the
jurisdiction of the heavens

00:01:15.655 --> 00:01:16.455 align:middle line:90%
and stars.

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to understand how
celestial mechanics affect

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:84%
our lives on Earth through
electromagnetic energy

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:90%
and gravity.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Consider what the moon
cycles do, for an instance,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.880 align:middle line:90%
with the tides of the oceans.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Since people consist
of 76% water,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
it is no surprise those affected
by lunar cycles of the moon

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.910 align:middle line:90%
are called lunatics.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:84%
If you check crime
statistics on a full moon,

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.780 align:middle line:84%
it will reveal an increase in
reports of irrational behavior.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Also, one complete cycle of
the moon around the Earth

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:90%
takes roughly 29 days.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.520 align:middle line:84%
This is nearly the
same period of time

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.730 align:middle line:84%
as the menses, or
menstrual cycle, of women.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:84%
In esoteric science,
it is taught

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
new endeavors should always
begin on a new moon, which

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
is the two-week period for when
the moon grows from blackness

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:84%
to the silvery shining orb
known as the full moon.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a positive time of
energy known as the waxing moon

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.580 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, during
a waning moon period,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
one should avoid
making major decisions

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
or starting new projects,
as this period being

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
the time of a full
moon to a new moon,

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
it is also a time of
decreasing energy.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:10%
The waning moon period
is a time for reflection

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:10%
and tending to the proverbial
seeds of new endeavors planted

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:10%
during the waxing moon period.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:84%
The waning moon period is
also a time for cleaning up

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:90%
before starting new endeavors.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:84%
The last three days of
a waning moon period,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
just before the
new moon, is also

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle line:90%
a time of extremely low energy.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:10%
When we study the origins
of Greek mythology,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.070 align:middle line:10%
we return to the account found
in the "Theogony" of Hesiod.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:84%
This 4,000-year-old classical
Greek text was lovingly

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:90%
preserved by Bullfinch.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It is from the seventh
and eighth centuries BCE.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:10%
This story was written
long before Greece

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:10%
became a great empire.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.220 align:middle line:10%
The "Theogony" of
Hesiod introduces us

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:10%
to Greek gods like Zeus,
Hera, Apollo, and Aries.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:10%
The incredible
part of this story

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:10%
is we learn of the legend of
Hesiod, a simple goat-herder

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:10%
who couldn't read or write.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:10%
And he had an
encounter with three--

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.600 align:middle line:10%
some say nine-- otherworldly,
angelic, nymph-like beings

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:10%
known as the Muses.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.550 align:middle line:84%
The main three were named
The Good, The Beautiful,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and The True, which we get
from the Socratic triad.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Not only did these muses glow
when they approached you,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:84%
they floated off the ground,
and they appeared and reappeared

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:90%
at will.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
After startling poor
old Hesiod, they

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
told him to record all
they said and aided him

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:84%
in the writing of his
encounters with them.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.700 align:middle line:84%
The Muses even taught
Hesiod about different gods

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
or extraterrestrials
inhabiting the heavens,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:84%
telling him there were
innumerable Earth-like planets,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and all of them
had their own gods.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:90%
But Zeus was the ruler of Earth.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:84%
They told him the astronomical
coordinates of heaven,

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
where Zeus dwelt.
Zeus, of course,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:84%
was also known as Jupiter,
the ruler of Cassiopeia.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.630 align:middle line:84%
The Muses also
talked about how long

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:84%
it would take for Hephaestus's
anvil to fall from the heavens

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
to Earth, and if you were to
drop it off his porch, exactly

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:90%
where it would land.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:84%
This story has
fascinating clues in it

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:84%
about the origins of humanity
and the personification

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
of astronomical observations
in our religious traditions.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Today we like to say the
Seven Wonders of the World

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
are the Taj Mahal in
India, Colosseum in Rome,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Chichen Itza in Mexico,
Machu Picchu in Peru,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Christ the Redeemer in
Brazil, Petra in Jordan,

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.590 align:middle line:90%
and the Great Wall of China.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But these are meaningless
compared to the Seven Wonders

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
of the Ancient World, which
held great significance

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
to the masters of antiquity and
were mapped out to the seven

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:84%
planetary bodies visible to the
naked eye, which, of course,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:84%
they were the Sun, Moon,
Mercury, Venus, Mars,

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Jupiter, and Saturn.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.700 align:middle line:84%
These also correspond
to the Bible's Seven

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Seals of Revelation and
the seven churches of Asia.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Of the Seven Wonders
of the Ancient World,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.060 align:middle line:84%
the Colossus of
Rhodes was the sun.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:84%
The Temple of Artemis or Diana
of Ephesus, near Kusadasi,

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.340 align:middle line:90%
in Turkey, was the moon.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:84%
The Temple of Artemis was one of
the most beautiful of the seven

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:90%
ancient wonders.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It had a replica of the
universe found within.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:84%
The Hanging Gardens
of Babylon was Venus.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.700 align:middle line:10%
The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus,
in Turkey, was Mars.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:84%
The Statue of Zeus at
Olympia was Jupiter.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:84%
The Lighthouse of Pharos,
in Alexandria, was Saturn.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the Great Pyramid
of Giza was Mercury.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And it is the only one of
the Seven Ancient Wonders

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:90%
that is still standing today.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:84%
To understand the significance
of these great monuments,

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.690 align:middle line:84%
you must remember
Gaia, or Mother Earth,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
is a living being with
a breathable atmosphere

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:90%
in her lungs.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And her rivers and oceans
are her bloodstream.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Gaia's chakras spread out
along our various ley lines

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.640 align:middle line:90%
and vortices of the Earth.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it is no
surprise that there

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:84%
are places of great energy
mapped to the heavens,

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:84%
such as the Giza Plateau,
which mimics the Milky Way

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:84%
galaxy, having three pyramids
aligned to the three stars

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:84%
forming the belt in the
constellation of Orion

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:90%
the Hunter.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.300 align:middle line:84%
To the ancients,
this association

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:84%
with our planetary bodies
held great importance

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.390 align:middle line:84%
in our daily lives and
our religious practices.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.480 align:middle line:10%
You find that in Judaism, with
the menorah, or the branches

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:10%
of the candelabrum, as there
are three candles on each side,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:10%
with the one in the
middle being the sun,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:10%
which is lit last so that
it does not cast a shadow.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
In magical traditions,
they uphold a teaching

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that certain
practices must be done

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.980 align:middle line:84%
during the planetary
hours in a day

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:84%
or the days of the
week associated

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:90%
with their movements.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I'll use the French counterparts
of the English names

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:84%
for the days of the week to
show their planetary association

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.120 align:middle line:90%
with the gods.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's
start with Monday

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:84%
being the lunar day,
which is lundi in French.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:90%
Tuesday is Mars day, or mardi.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Wednesday is Mercury
day, or mercredi.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Thursday or Thor's day, the day
of Jupiter, is jeudi in French.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Friday, which is
named after Frigga,

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
the Norse version of the goddess
Venus, is vendredi in French.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Saturday, or Saturn
day, is samedi.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And finally, Sunday, or the
day of the sun, is dimanche.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And while our major
religions might

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.200 align:middle line:84%
serve different holy days,
such as how Judaism honors

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
the Sabbath, which
is the day of Saturn,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:84%
modern Christianity, like the
Mithraism practice in Rome,

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:84%
has a Sun God, or a son of God,
and goes to church on Sunday.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:10%
Islam has traditionally been
thought of as a religion that

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:10%
excludes feminine symbolism
but, actually, their holy day

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:10%
is Friday, or the day
for the goddess Venus.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.510 align:middle line:10%
The color green is
not only traditionally

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:10%
sacred and important to
Venus, but it was also

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.370 align:middle line:10%
important to the
prophet, which should

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.640 align:middle line:10%
come of no surprise
to anyone that we find

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:10%
the color green on many
mosques and on the flags

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.880 align:middle line:10%
of Islamic countries
like Pakistan.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you look at the
crescent and the scimitar that

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:84%
has been associated
with Islam, it

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:84%
was also used on the flag
of the Ottoman Empire.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Many incorrectly assumed
that it is the moon,

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle line:84%
but actually it is
Venus, which appears

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.100 align:middle line:84%
like a crescent
in the night sky.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
The smaller star beside
it is the first star

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.120 align:middle line:90%
to appear alongside it.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.690 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:84%
In occult traditions, the
macrocosmic association

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:84%
of the planetary energies is
also found in the human body

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and mapped out into the
palmistry of your hand.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:84%
This is also the case when
performing certain magic spells

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
that require your hands to be
positioned in a certain way.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.890 align:middle line:84%
How we look at this is that
your thumb area is Venus,

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter is your pointer finger,
Saturn is your middle finger,

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Apollo is the ring finger, and
Mercury as your pinky finger.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.955 align:middle line:84%
This is why, if you
point at someone,

00:10:03.955 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:84%
it is a powerful
gesture of sending

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
a commanding
Jupiter-like energy.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Or when you give someone the
middle finger for an instance,

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:17.090 align:middle line:84%
you're actually banishing them
away with Saturnal energy.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
But when we look up
at the night sky,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot more going on
with our celestial mechanics

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:84%
than just the movement
of planetary bodies,

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.300 align:middle line:84%
as we can see around 88
constellations, which are now

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:84%
easier than ever to observe
with sky-mapping apps

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:84%
on our mobile phones and
different online sky charts.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:84%
The science for looking at
the movements and positions

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.180 align:middle line:84%
of celestial objects
is called astrology,

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:84%
which comes from the Greek words
"astro," meaning "the stars,"

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and the "logy" part comes
from "logos," meaning

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.430 align:middle line:90%
"knowledge" or "science."

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Today, this has
evolved into astronomy,

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
which, again, we derive from
the Greek "astro" for the stars

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and "nomy," meaning
"measurements or arrangements

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:90%
of the celestial bodies."

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:90%
[GRACEFUL MUSIC]

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Our fascination with the heavens
goes back to ancient Egypt,

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:84%
the Persian Magi,
who called themselves

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
the stargazers, the Phoenicians,
the Chaldeans, the Hindus,

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.470 align:middle line:90%
and the Chinese.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:84%
All of these groups
had their own zodiacs

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.290 align:middle line:84%
that they would use to
calculate and observe

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:90%
the movements of the heavens.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans in
North and South America

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
had their own understanding
of the heavenly bodies.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:10%
The 12 constellations, which
come from a Latin word,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:10%
"constellatio," meaning
"a set of stars,"

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.630 align:middle line:10%
are just the groups
of stars found

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:10%
in the circular path of our
sun, that it moves along

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:10%
throughout the year.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:84%
This is where the ancient
zodiac of the Greeks

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.350 align:middle line:84%
came from, which is
derived from "zodiakos,"

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.940 align:middle line:84%
meaning "a circle of animals"
or "the little animals."

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:84%
The association of the
zodiac with 12 creatures

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
was not only due to their
appearance in the sky

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
but also a symbolic
personification of how

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:84%
intense the sun was as it passed
through its various houses

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:90%
in our elliptical orbit.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Some have imagined that
this knowledge came

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
from shepherds a few
thousand years ago,

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.160 align:middle line:84%
who were minding their
flocks in the field,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.170 align:middle line:84%
looking up at the
stars at night.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.080 align:middle line:90%
But this is highly unlikely.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.230 align:middle line:84%
It's much like how
alchemy is one of the most

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:middle line:84%
ancient of sciences
on the planet

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and comes from our prehistoric
civilizations like Atlantis.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Both sciences are probably
millions of years old.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Astrology has been traditionally
thought to go hand in hand

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
with alchemy, better
known as astro-alchemy.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And many esotericists believe
once we combine these two

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.830 align:middle line:84%
sets of knowledge, they
can help restore us

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.480 align:middle line:84%
to our original state
before the cataclysms.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:10%
The Greeks split up the
zodiac into 12 sections,

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:10%
with each having 30 degrees in
length and 16 degrees in width.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.360 align:middle line:10%
These are what we call houses.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.460 align:middle line:10%
And the sun makes
an annual journey

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:10%
through each of
these, where we can

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:10%
find the various creatures bound
by rectangles in their star

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:10%
groups or constellations.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I've always been a
big believer that we

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
need to treat our religions
like a science, which

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
we know they have many
incredible truths in them to be

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:84%
discovered, for those
with eyes to see.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:10%
We find this is true of not
only the ancient Egyptians, who

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:10%
adorn their buildings
with glorious reliefs

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.760 align:middle line:10%
of solar pageantry like
we find with Nut, the sky

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:10%
goddess, which, of
course, is the Milky Way.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.730 align:middle line:84%
We also find this was true
of the ancient Persians, who

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.760 align:middle line:84%
encoded their religions
with the solar mysteries,

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:84%
as we learn about Mithra
or, even more anciently,

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Zurvan, the lion-headed
god, being the sun in Leo.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.400 align:middle line:84%
When we divide up the
12 signs of the zodiac

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:84%
with the movements of the sun
in the northern hemisphere,

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:84%
the first six
signs of the zodiac

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:84%
are considered to be
benevolent and positive signs

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:84%
because that's the time of
the year when the sun is

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:84%
moving into the summer months,
and it is warm in those months.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.620 align:middle line:84%
The signs in the
second half of the year

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.890 align:middle line:84%
are negative because that was
when the sun was traveling

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
through the southern
hemisphere, which

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:84%
made it colder and
darker in the winter

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:21.100 align:middle line:84%
months for the Greeks, the
Egyptians, and the Persians.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.040 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the back of
Hathor's Temple in Dendera,

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, we find one of the oldest
circular zodiacs in the world.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:10%
And it probably
came from Ptolemy,

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:10%
who was the best friend and
general of Alexander the Great.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:84%
This place was connected
to Greco-Roman times.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Today, we can only find a copy
of this zodiac on the roof,

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:84%
as the original was moved
to the Louvre, in Paris,

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
as today, the Egyptians
aren't very happy about that.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.740 align:middle line:10%
But here we find a circular
formation of the constellations

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:10%
similar to the Greek ones, with
the hieroglyphics or letters

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.220 align:middle line:10%
in their ascending order.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting system that
involves 12 signs of the zodiac

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:84%
is the Chinese
zodiac, which moves

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.640 align:middle line:84%
in the 24 cardinal directions
associated with the lunar

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:90%
calendar.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:84%
This is also associated with the
elements of fire, earth, metal,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.810 align:middle line:90%
and water.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And because of this,
the year is divided up

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:84%
into a yin, which is the
end of an odd number that

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:27.430 align:middle line:84%
is represented with the
feminine nature of passiveness

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
or darkness, and then
there are the yang years,

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.610 align:middle line:84%
which are masculine, positive,
and productive years,

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:34.735 align:middle line:90%
according to their system.

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
The significance of the
constellations are as follows.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
We start out with
Aries, which was once

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.900 align:middle line:84%
the first constellation of
the zodiac but now the second.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It is known by the
two bright stars that

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:84%
are four degrees apart and
has the two horns of the ram.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.170 align:middle line:10%
In the Hebrew zodiac,
it is assigned to Simeon

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:00.670 align:middle line:10%
or sometimes Gad, one of
the 12 tribes of Israel.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Then we move on to
Taurus, the bull,

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:84%
as this is the constellation
in Greek mythology

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:84%
that's associated with
Zeus and the Pleiades,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and it is near the
constellation of Orion.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Old
Testament, we learn

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:84%
from the story about the
Egyptian, Job, who, by the way,

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
scholars believe was the Fourth
Dynasty King of Egypt, Khufu,

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and was someone who suffered
faithfully with many trials

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.010 align:middle line:90%
and tribulations in his life.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:84%
But there is a reference
to Job and Orion

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:84%
when it says in the
Bible, "Canst thou

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:84%
bind the sweet influences
of the Pleiades,

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:90%
or loose the bands of Orion?"

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Taurus the bull is
always portrayed

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.920 align:middle line:84%
as charging towards Orion
with his horns facing down.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
His face is composed of
the five bright stars,

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:90%
which form a V known as Hades.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And the brightest of all
these is Aldebaran, which

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:90%
was used by ancient navigators.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:10%
In the Hebrew zodiac, Taurus
is assigned to Joseph.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.119 align:middle line:84%
That brings us to
Gemini, or the twins,

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:84%
which are composed of two bright
stars called Castor and Pollux.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:84%
These are about 4 and
1/2 degrees apart.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
In Greek mythology,
they are said

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.066 align:middle line:84%
to be the twin sons that
Jupiter had with Leda.

00:17:16.066 --> 00:17:18.399 align:middle line:10%
And on the Hebrew zodiac,
they are assigned to Benjamin.

00:17:18.399 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Then we arrive at
Cancer, or the Crab.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.770 align:middle line:84%
This constellation is
composed of two stars.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And in some Eastern
systems, they

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:84%
are two figures of,
like, animals or donkeys.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:10%
The Hebrews assigned
it to Isaachar.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.510 align:middle line:84%
After that, we have
Leo the lion king,

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.480 align:middle line:84%
which is called the
Sole House of the Sun,

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.610 align:middle line:84%
as it marks the
arrival of the summer

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.980 align:middle line:84%
solstice in the northern
hemisphere, when

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:90%
the sun is at its hottest.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.650 align:middle line:84%
The lion's mane is also
symbolic of the coronas

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:90%
of the sun or the sun rays.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:10%
Leo is composed of
stars, but his body

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:10%
forms a sickle when we look
at two of its brightest stars,

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:10%
which are Regulus and Denebola.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:10%
One star in the head of
the line, and the other

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:10%
is at the tail of the lion.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Leo is very important to the
Mysteries for many reasons.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:84%
According to Masonic lore,
it is the sacred position

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:84%
of King Solomon's temple,
and it has a connection

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:84%
to the Sphinx on
the Giza Plateau.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:10%
In the Hebrew zodiac,
we can associate this

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.720 align:middle line:10%
with the Lion of Judah.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.480 align:middle line:84%
From there, we reach
Virgo the Virgin.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:84%
In the Egyptian zodiac, this
is the beautiful mother goddess

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:90%
known as Isis.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.070 align:middle line:84%
In her left hand, she's
holding ripe wheat

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that is marked by a
bright star called Spica.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:10%
In the Hebrew zodiac,
Virgo is associated

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:10%
with Naphtali, which was a
tree bearing good branches.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Then we move to Libra,
which, since ancient times,

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:90%
has been represented by a woman.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:84%
There's no human figure for
Libra in the Arabian zodiac

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:84%
however, as it is
prohibited in the Koran

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
to make a human
representation of the divine.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.890 align:middle line:10%
This is also the
case for our zodiac,

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.250 align:middle line:10%
as according to the author of
"Stellar Theology and Masonic

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.710 align:middle line:10%
Astrology," Robert Hewitt Brown.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.790 align:middle line:10%
He tells us that we
probably received our zodiac

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:10%
from the Arab astronomers.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:10%
The Hebrew association
with Libra is Asher.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.940 align:middle line:84%
That brings us to
Scorpio, which is composed

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.280 align:middle line:84%
of bright stars that
resembles a kite

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.020 align:middle line:90%
with the tail of a scorpion.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:10%
The Hebrew zodiac association
to Scorpio is the tribe of Dan.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Then we move into Sagittarius.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:84%
He is the great archer,
sometimes depicted

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.540 align:middle line:84%
as a centaur that is
half-horse and half-man.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:10%
At the center, he's holding
a bow and shooting an arrow.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:84%
This constellation
is easily identified

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.020 align:middle line:84%
with his inverted dipper
as one of the largest

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.610 align:middle line:84%
in the southern area of the sky,
formed by several bright stars.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius also appears in the
Egyptian and Indian zodiacs.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Then we move on to
Capricorn, which is the goat.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:10%
And it is connected to
the winter solstice,

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:10%
being composed of
51 small stars.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.130 align:middle line:84%
In the Asiatic systems, it
was known as the Southern

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Gate of the Sun.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.460 align:middle line:84%
After that, we find
ourselves in Aquarius,

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:84%
which is sometimes portrayed
as a man or a woman

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
holding a water pitcher,
bringing the waters of spring.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:10%
When you look at the water
that's pouring out from the urn

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:10%
that Aquarius is holding,
which, by the way,

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.830 align:middle line:10%
are sometimes called the
waters of eternal life,

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.730 align:middle line:10%
this is the path of the
sun or the Solar Messiah.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.640 align:middle line:10%
In the Hebrew zodiac,
Aquarius is represented

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.705 align:middle line:10%
by the tribe of Reuben.

00:20:42.705 --> 00:20:45.450 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And finally, Pisces is
represented by the two fish.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.600 align:middle line:10%
In the Hebrew
zodiac, this is found

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.725 align:middle line:10%
with the fishers of Simeon.

00:20:52.725 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:84%
In these teachings, we discover
that our sun makes a round trip

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
around the zodiac and returns
to where it started every year.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
vernal equinox.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But each time it
does, it comes up

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit short of
completing a full journey

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:90%
in that period of time.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So it crosses the equator
just behind the sign

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.240 align:middle line:90%
of where it started.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, when
the sign moves 30 degrees,

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.230 align:middle line:84%
it loses one degree
every 72 years.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
The number 72 is very
important to the Mysteries.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.550 align:middle line:84%
It is mentioned all throughout
our ancient religions,

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:34.840 align:middle line:84%
with references to the 72
names of god in the Kabbalah

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:84%
or the 72 angels of the Tarot
and the Shem HaMephorash,

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:84%
the 72 steps on
Jacob's ladder, the 72

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:84%
languages at the Tower of Babel,
the 72 disciples of Confucius,

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:90%
and the list goes on and on.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:10%
One of the most
important observations

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.500 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient peoples
with this process

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.920 align:middle line:10%
is something known as the
precession of the equinoxes,

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:10%
a gravity-induced, slow
and continuous change

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.780 align:middle line:10%
in the orientation of the
Earth's axial rotation.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:10%
Plato called this
the Great Year.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.020 align:middle line:10%
Not only do we know
the Earth moves

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.110 align:middle line:10%
through space with a
wobble, but a full cycle

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.950 align:middle line:10%
of the gradual shifting of
the Earth's axial rotation

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:21.870 align:middle line:10%
can last approximately
25,772 years.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:10%
That's approximately
26,000 years.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.710 align:middle line:10%
Each age is determined
by how the sun stays

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.470 align:middle line:10%
in a certain age or
constellation for about

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:10%
2,160 years.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, it was personified
with various characteristics,

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:10%
as you will find within the
concept of the Solar Messiah.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.690 align:middle line:84%
We get a great example of this
if we go back to the Moses

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.550 align:middle line:90%
story in the Old Testament.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Here we learn about Moses
coming down the mountain

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:90%
with the Ten Commandments.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:10%
He sees the Israelites
have fashioned

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:10%
an idol in the shape of a golden
calf from the spoils of Egypt.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And he becomes furious
with anger and orders

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:90%
them to destroy it.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:84%
The destruction
of the golden calf

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.610 align:middle line:84%
is symbolic of the completion or
the ending of the Taurean age.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we know that
Taurus is the great bull, which

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
we also found was
relevant to the Hindu age,

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
or what we call the
Hindu reign, which is

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:90%
why cows are sacred in India.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:84%
This is also where Oxford
University comes from,

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:84%
as the Apis bull was also
sacred to the Egyptians.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:10%
When this age was ending, the
Persian Zoroastrian solar god

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.930 align:middle line:10%
Mithra ripped the
head off of a bull,

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:10%
just like Moses destroying
the golden calf.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:10%
After he destroys the
calf, we arrive into Aries,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:10%
with the Moses story
transitioning to the ram's

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:10%
horn, or the shofar horn.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.620 align:middle line:84%
During the age of
Taurus, the Solar Messiah

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.570 align:middle line:90%
was Dionysus, or Bacchus.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:90%
It was called the Good Shepherd.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
That brings us to our current
age of Pisces, where Jesus

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:07.320 align:middle line:84%
is the Son of God, or a sun
god that multiplied two fish

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.390 align:middle line:90%
and encountered two fishermen.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is referred to as
being a fisher of men.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Also, when Christians
observed Good Friday,

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:84%
they were told that
they can only eat fish

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:90%
and not other types of meat.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
We also find this
symbolism on one

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.350 align:middle line:84%
of the oldest Christian
temples in the world,

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:84%
on the floor mosaic
of Megiddo, Israel.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I've also found these fish
mosaics and other places,

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.920 align:middle line:84%
such as in the ancient
city of Ephesus, in Turkey.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Jesus tells us in
the Bible that he

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:40.720 align:middle line:84%
will be with us until the end
of the eon, which we know,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.840 align:middle line:84%
of course, is just
the end of the age.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.730 align:middle line:84%
If we look at Luke 22:10
in the King James Bible,

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.850 align:middle line:84%
the disciples say to
him, Master, Master,

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.160 align:middle line:84%
where will you be at
the last Passover?

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:10%
And Jesus answers them
saying, meet me at the house--

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.120 align:middle line:10%
which, of course, is
an astrological term--

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:10%
with the man with
the water pitcher.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So who is the man with the
water pitcher, you might ask?

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's Aquarius,
bringing the waters of spring.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.820 align:middle line:84%
The story of each Solar
Messiah is seeded here

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:84%
by the mystery schools
and plays a different role

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.440 align:middle line:90%
according to the age we are in.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Since Jesus is
leaving this age, we

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.880 align:middle line:84%
are moving into the
Age of Aquarius.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So we might ask ourselves
what might the characteristics

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.270 align:middle line:90%
of the new Solar Messiah be?

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's just think for a moment,
hypothetically speaking,

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.970 align:middle line:84%
what would one of these
world saviors look

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
like if they came back today
with the characteristics

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:90%
of being the Aquarian Messiah?

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we look at the
traditional descriptions

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:84%
of Aquarius, we would
say that maybe they

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:52.980 align:middle line:84%
were androgynous or a type
of ET from the stars that

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
is born around the
winter solstice,

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:90%
from artificial insemination.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Being the water
bearer, maybe they

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.610 align:middle line:84%
could help us fix the
world's water supplies

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:90%
and clean up our oceans.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they will be
personified as having

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:84%
12 scientists around them
instead of disciples.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:10%
And if they are
persecuted and die,

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:10%
the modern version
of this story would

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.110 align:middle line:10%
be that they were
resurrected after three days,

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.770 align:middle line:10%
and we injected them full of
peptides, electrical nerve

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.070 align:middle line:10%
stimulation, and laser
therapy directed at the brain

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:10%
to bring them back to life.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, these ages have been
encoded all around us,

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.080 align:middle line:90%
for those with eyes to see.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the
Hoover Dam in Nevada,

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.170 align:middle line:84%
you will see that there's all
sorts of esoteric symbolism

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:84%
there, with the two
angels at the back,

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and there is a full map of the
precession of the equinoxes

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.840 align:middle line:90%
or the cycles of ages.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.700 align:middle line:10%
Another example
we get of this is

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.430 align:middle line:10%
from esoteric
authors Jay Weidner

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.910 align:middle line:10%
and the late Vincent Bridges,
in their fascinating book

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.700 align:middle line:10%
called "The Mysteries of
the Great Cross of Hendaye,"

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:10%
where they revealed an encoded
message hidden in a cross found

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.540 align:middle line:10%
in Southern France
that displayed

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:11.190 align:middle line:10%
astrological and alchemical
connections to our great cycles

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.280 align:middle line:10%
and changes on Earth that will
happen with our sun and weather

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:10%
patterns.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.140 align:middle line:10%
They also tied this to the work
of the 20th century alchemist

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.260 align:middle line:10%
Fulcanelli, who revealed
these messages were also

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.030 align:middle line:10%
encoded into the
cathedrals around Europe,

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:10%
including Notre Dame in Paris.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.650 align:middle line:10%
Paracelcus once
told us, "The body

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:10%
comes from the elements,
the soul from the stars,

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.750 align:middle line:10%
and the spirit from God.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.940 align:middle line:10%
All that the intellect
can conceive of

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.150 align:middle line:10%
comes from the stars or
the spirits of the stars,

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.450 align:middle line:10%
rather than the material
constellations."

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it is
not hard to see how

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:84%
almost every major
religion in the world

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.890 align:middle line:90%
is based on astrotheology.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Astrotheology can be used
as an ancient roadmap

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.290 align:middle line:90%
to find ourselves home.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:84%
It is clear that the initiates
of the mystery schools, knowing

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:84%
the Atlantean or prehistoric
secrets of astro-alchemy

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:84%
left behind various
signs and clues for us

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:13.920 align:middle line:84%
in plain sight about
the mystery of the ages.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jonny Enoch, and thanks for
watching "Mystery Teachings."
