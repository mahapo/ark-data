00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Jonny Enoch, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.940 align:middle line:10%
To the ancient
peoples, the sun was

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:10%
seen as a powerful giver of
life and was often depicted

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:10%
in different forms on
enormous temples and churches.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors weren't
so much sun worshippers,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.550 align:middle line:84%
but they understood that
this golden orb in the sky

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
helped grow their crops and
kept the wild animals away

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:90%
that lurked in the night.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:10%
The Persian Magi, or
ancient magicians,

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:10%
would often carry around
metal mirrors with them

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:10%
to reflect the symbols of God's
creative powers and nature.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:84%
They understood that if we
wanted to see the invisible,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.340 align:middle line:84%
first we had to use the
illusory world as the key

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:84%
to unlock these
hidden realities.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they understood
the macrocosmic perspective

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
of the sun and its cycles as
an archetypical representation

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.770 align:middle line:90%
for universal light and truth.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Just as the old axiom teaches
us, "as above, so below,"

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:84%
you might find that a hill
of ants in your backyard

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:84%
is just as much
organized and industrious

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.210 align:middle line:90%
as the largest cities on Earth.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:84%
If you look close enough
into someone's eyes,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
you could see galaxies swirling
around inside their corneas.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Much in the same way
that our bodies are

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
made from the atoms of exploded
stars, these minute particles

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:84%
come from around
the Milky Way galaxy

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and travel here along
interstellar winds,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:84%
proving that everything
is connected.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And because nature was a
reflection of the divine,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors would serenade
the sun with beautiful poems

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and songs like
the Mazdean "Hymns

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to the Sun" from the
Zoroastrians or Akhenaten's

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:90%
"Hymn to the Aten."

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:10%
Whenever Jordan Maxwell and I
are visiting Manly P. Hall's

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:10%
Philosophical Research
Society in Los Angeles,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:10%
we have a tradition of standing
in front of the Egyptian statue

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:10%
out front and reading its
beautiful poem out loud.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:10%
"Thou sun, who has covered the
truth with thy golden disc,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:10%
do thou remove the veil so that
I may see the truth within thee

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.310 align:middle line:10%
and know the meaning
of the rays of glory

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.640 align:middle line:10%
for the truth which is
within thee is within me.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:10%
And I am that."

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Egyptians had
traditions involving sun gods,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:10%
as Isis, who is also the moon,
gave birth to Horus, the falcon

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:10%
that rises into the sky.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:84%
These solar mysteries
have even been passed down

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:84%
into the English language-- as
the sun rises on the horizon,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:90%
or the Horus has risen.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.190 align:middle line:84%
This is also where we get
hours from or "horsuses"

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
because Horus takes 12 steps
across the sky just like the 12

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:90%
hours during the daytime.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Another sun God
from ancient Egypt

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
was Amun, as in
Amun-Ra, whose name

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
translates to "be kept
secret or hidden away."

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:84%
This is why all three major
Abrahamic religions say "amen"

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:84%
at the end of their prayers as
it does not mean "make it so,"

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:84%
as some incorrectly
believe, but rather is more

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
correctly translated
to "make what is hidden

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:90%
known to the divine."

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Other solar trinities
we find include

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
the trimurti of Hinduism with
Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:84%
or the Egyptian with
Osiris, Isis, Horus.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:10%
This is the same as the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:10%
or the mind, body, and spirit.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:84%
These are really just
all different aspects

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
of the solar deity with the
morning sun, midday sun,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:90%
and evening sun.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:84%
We find this
three-layered symbolism

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:84%
in Greco-Roman and
Gothic architecture

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
as well using the
triptych archway

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:90%
as an initiation doorway.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a popular design on
old governmental buildings

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and churches, like Rosslyn
Chapel in Scotland.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.450 align:middle line:84%
In my travels, I have found
countless sun discs and wheels

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
on churches all over the
place, especially when we

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:84%
examine St. Peter's
Basilica at the Vatican.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.370 align:middle line:84%
The reason that kings and
queens were appointed crown

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
is because it resembles
the coronas of the sun.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:10%
This is also why they carried
a scepter with an orbit

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.080 align:middle line:10%
at the end of it.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:84%
This is because
they are mimicking

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
the sun or the supreme ruler
of the kingdom of heaven.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
That makes our sun the
ruler of our solar system,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and the planets
and all of nature

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
are its royal
court and subjects.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:84%
We see this on the
Statue of Liberty,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
which says in the
bottom of it that it

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.510 align:middle line:84%
was a gift from the French
Grand Orient temple masons

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:84%
to the first Masonic
Republic, which was America.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Not only is Lady Liberty holding
the torch of illuminations,

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:84%
but she is crowned with
the coronas of the sun.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.680 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Solar symbolism can be found
all throughout the Bible

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:90%
in the mysteries.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Take the story of Samson
who had his blondish,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.610 align:middle line:84%
reddish seven locks
of hair cut off

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.730 align:middle line:84%
to symbolize the
rays of the sun.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.300 align:middle line:84%
We have the Lion of the
tribe of Judah, Prometheus,

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:84%
or the Suryavashna
family in India

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:84%
whose stories are all
about the solar orb

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
entering the sign of Leo or the
sun typically became very hot

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and it makes it summertime
in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Every astrological age
has a solar messiah

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:90%
seeded by the mystery schools.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.740 align:middle line:10%
Currently, we are in
the age of Pisces,

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:10%
so the sun is
symbolized by Jesus

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:10%
who calls himself the fisher
of men, multiplies two fish

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:10%
and encounters two fishermen.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:10%
But just like Hercules and his
12 acts of wonder or Mithra

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.620 align:middle line:10%
has 12 helpers, Jesus
had 12 disciples,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:10%
which is the sun or son of God
with his 12 constellations.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Since Jesus is the solar
messiah of our age,

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:84%
let us explore why his story is
important and who he really was

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and how this solar
symbolism became

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.160 align:middle line:90%
associated with his story.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:10%
In my travels to England,
I was surprised to learn

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:10%
from British historians
and religious scholars

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:10%
at Oxford University that
the royal family believes

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:10%
they are directly related
to the lineage of Jesus

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:10%
and that he comes from
a royal bloodline.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:10%
Even their symbolism
of the lion outside

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:10%
of Buckingham Palace or
the Royal Standard flag

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:10%
also relates to the Lion of
the tribe of Judah, a name that

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:10%
has also been
attributed to Jesus,

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.050 align:middle line:10%
which is a symbol for the sun
god or the son of god in Leo.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
According to the writings
of the Greek historian

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Celsus in 155 CE and
the Jewish Talmud,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
the true identity
of Jesus is actually

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeshua ben Pantera, which
literally translates

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:90%
to "Jesus, son of Panthera."

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is who the Vatican
and the royal historians

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
truly believe Jesus was and how
he came from royal bloodlines.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:10%
This story begins
in ancient Rome

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:10%
where erotic games were very
common during those times.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:10%
There was a Roman
soldier named Panthera

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.430 align:middle line:10%
who later became an important
ruler known as Tiberius Caesar.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
As the story goes,
he had his way

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
with a woman he
found attractive,

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.230 align:middle line:84%
who he later called Mary, which
is an Egyptian title for Isis,

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.775 align:middle line:84%
associated with
the mother goddess.

00:07:40.775 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Not only did Panthera
impregnate Mary,

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.950 align:middle line:84%
but she gave birth to twins
for him, one being Jesus

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and the other was
Judas or Thomas.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, "Thomas"
also means "twin."

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle line:10%
In those days, a Roman
official could not

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:10%
claim a child born
with a commoner,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:10%
but he had lots of reason
to brag to his friends

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:10%
privately about it since
it was considered good luck

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle line:10%
by the gods if you had twins.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
When we go back to the
story of Mary and Joseph,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:84%
we have to examine Joseph a
little closer as his last name

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.710 align:middle line:90%
was Pandera, as in Panther.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.850 align:middle line:10%
We are also told that he was
a wealthy carpenter, otherwise

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:10%
known as an artificer,
a craftsman, or mason,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:10%
and he had taken on the
duties of raising Jesus.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:84%
We are told in the
"Protoevangelium of James"

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
that Joseph was
around 90 at the time

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:84%
when he steps into the
picture to help Mary, which

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:90%
is why he never laid with her.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.350 align:middle line:10%
Manly P. Hall writes in "The
Secret Teachings Of All Ages,"

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.410 align:middle line:10%
Godfrey Higgins has
discovered two references,

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:10%
one in the "Midrashjoholeth" and
the other in the "Abodazara,"

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:10%
these early Jewish
commentaries on the scriptures,

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.510 align:middle line:10%
to the effect that the
surname of Joseph's family

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.410 align:middle line:10%
was "Panther."

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.510 align:middle line:10%
For in both of
these works, it is

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:10%
stated that a man was healed in
the name of Jesus Ben Panther.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
The name "Panther" establishes
a direct connection

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.460 align:middle line:84%
between Jesus and Bacchus,
who is nursed by panthers

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and is sometimes depicted riding
either on one of these animals

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:90%
or in a chariot drawn by them.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:84%
The skin of the
panther was also sacred

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:84%
in certain of the Egyptian
initiatory ceremonials.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Similar to the life of
Sir Francis Bacon, who

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:84%
was born Francis Tudor, the
bastard son of Elizabeth I,

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.930 align:middle line:84%
the son of Panther
was adopted and raised

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:84%
privately with a great
education and opportunities.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.390 align:middle line:10%
The historical
Jesus was, in fact,

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:10%
born to a royal family
of Roman lineage

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:10%
and was given great
opportunities.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.570 align:middle line:10%
The story of Jesus taught
by modern day Christianity

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.120 align:middle line:10%
is one of the most
ancient and important ones

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:10%
ever told, as it is
greatly allegorical

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:10%
and draws from mithraism,
which was a popular religion

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:10%
in those days around Rome.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:84%
We find this in the ancient
imperial sun cults, which

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:90%
were common during those times.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
reason why the Roman

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.510 align:middle line:84%
soldiers had those sun flares
on the top of their helmets.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:84%
One very important
secret about the Bible

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.020 align:middle line:84%
is that the New Testament is
far older than the Old Testament

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and it is filled with
allegorical stories

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.800 align:middle line:90%
about astral theology.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:10%
For example, according to
Manly P. Hall, the Book of John

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:10%
existed centuries before
the alleged birth of Jesus

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.180 align:middle line:10%
and all the references
referring to the universal mind

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:10%
were replaced by Jesus.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Revelation or
the apocalypse according

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.590 align:middle line:84%
to Saint John is not
only the Atlantis story,

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:84%
but it is actually an ancient
book belonging to the Phrygians

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and is probably
one of the oldest,

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
if not the oldest books
in the entire Bible.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:10%
For this reason,
much of the writings

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:10%
about the life of Jesus in the
New Testament are allegorical

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.830 align:middle line:10%
and even the books Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:10%
are about the four
seasons of the sun.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:84%
There is another version of
the story of the life of Jesus

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
that is different than
the Solar Messiah that's

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:84%
filled with arcane
teachings and wisdom

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:84%
that we find in the Gnostic
Gospels, the Pistis Sophia

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:90%
and the Books of the Savior.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Please keep in mind
that many of these books

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
were destroyed in the
early stages of Christendom

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
with the Council of Nicaea
and the Ecumenical Council.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Churches today draw mainly from
the gospels and epistles, which

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:84%
were added fragments
from the anti Nicaean

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:90%
and post Nicaean fathers.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:10%
And since we know that the
writings of Flavius Josephus

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:10%
were forgeries, in
the apocryphal gospels

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:10%
we find numerous details
about his actual life

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:10%
that probably happened.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:84%
In the Gospel of
Thomas, we learn

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.740 align:middle line:84%
that while growing up
in the house of Joseph,

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was in fact
born with the ability

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:84%
to focus and
concentrate great energy

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and could perform miracles like
molding sparrows out of clay

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.960 align:middle line:90%
that came to life and flew away.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.510 align:middle line:84%
In the Arabic scriptures,
it describes Jesus

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:90%
as being an astronomer.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
In the Talmud, we
learn that Jesus

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.950 align:middle line:84%
would have visited Alexandria,
Egypt, which by the way,

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
is where we get the
connections to the Nag

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Hammadi, Coptic Christians, and
those areas of Christianity.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are
also many similarities

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:90%
we find between Jesus and Horus.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.870 align:middle line:10%
The ancient teachings
tell us that Jesus

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.226 align:middle line:10%
was brought to Alexandria by
Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Perachia.

00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, he was
said to have studied

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:84%
the occult and metaphysics
at the hermetic college

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:84%
of Ptolemies before
returning to Syria.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.750 align:middle line:84%
After Syria, it is
greatly believed

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle line:84%
that he would have
traveled eastward

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.030 align:middle line:84%
to be initiated into
the mysteries of India.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Alexandria was a very
liberal place back then,

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.770 align:middle line:84%
being sort of like
a Las Vegas, and it

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.260 align:middle line:84%
became the melting pot of
Hellenistic and Asiatic

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:90%
cultures.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.230 align:middle line:84%
The mystery deepens further
when we examine the writings

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:84%
of the French mystic and writer
Edouard Schuré who hypothesizes

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:84%
that a historical Jesus could
have been a member of Essene

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
sect, which is a messianic group
that taught carpentry, alchemy,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:84%
and occult practices, otherwise
known as a secret society.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.110 align:middle line:84%
They would have possibly
been originally founded

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:84%
by Pythagoras and based on the
teachings of ancient Egypt.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:84%
His theory is based
on the concept

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus the Nazarene
could have been mistranslated

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:90%
from Jesus of the Nazarites.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:84%
This could explain why
Jesus was considered

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:84%
to be someone of great
importance by the Romans

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:84%
so he was venerated by
the mystery schools.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.260 align:middle line:84%
But where these
stories differ is

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:84%
that according to the Gnostics,
Jesus never died and he went on

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:90%
to live a full life.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:84%
But in the mainstream
version, why are we

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:90%
told that he died on a cross?

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle line:84%
That is because the
Son of God is always

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.645 align:middle line:84%
crucified on the cross, which
is a very ancient symbol

00:13:57.645 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and comes from
the Egyptian ankh.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:90%
It is also a proto Hindu symbol.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:84%
As Paracelsus points
out, the cross

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:84%
has always been used to show
the sun divided up perfectly

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.050 align:middle line:84%
into the four
quarters of the year.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest
examples we get for this

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:84%
is with the Celtic
cross, as we can clearly

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:84%
see the four parts of the circle
with lines going through it.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting
connection we

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:84%
get between Jesus and the
other Solar Messiahs that

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:84%
came before him
are the titles he

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:84%
shares with Dionysus or Bacchus,
the Lord of the Vineyards.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It was often said that the sun
made grapes grow on the vines

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:90%
so he could turn water to wine.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.750 align:middle line:84%
This is why we celebrate
communion in churches

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.930 align:middle line:84%
by drinking wine for the
blood of Bacchus, which later

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:90%
became the blood of Jesus.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Another clue we get about
Christianity being seeded

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.880 align:middle line:84%
by the mystery schools
is that traditionally we

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.110 align:middle line:84%
celebrate the birth of Jesus
on Christmas or Christ mass

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:90%
around December 25th.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:10%
But in the Bible,
it says that Jesus

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:10%
was born when the
shepherds were minding

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:10%
their flocks in the fields.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about it, it would

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.470 align:middle line:84%
be too cold outside
at Christmas time

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.250 align:middle line:84%
for there to be any
shepherds out there.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:10%
It says in the Book of Luke
that Jesus was born six months

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.880 align:middle line:10%
from John the Baptist,
which according to scholars

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:10%
would be approximately
at the end of September.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So why then are
all the solar gods

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:90%
born around the winter solstice?

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a moment to examine
this very ancient and beautiful

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Our story begins with the
sun, our risen Savior,

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.530 align:middle line:90%
the light of the world.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:10%
As it is closest to
the northern hemisphere

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:10%
in the constellation
of Leo the lion

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:10%
king or during the summertime.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Then 90 days or
90 degrees later,

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:53.410 align:middle line:84%
he's born into this world
from Virgo the Virgin, who's

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:90%
holding wheat in her hand.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.640 align:middle line:10%
So we call this
constellation the house

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:10%
of bread or another name
for it is Bethlehem.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:10%
The star in the East
preceding his birth is Sirius

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:10%
and the three stars
are the wise men

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:10%
that align around Orion
to point to the sunrise.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:84%
After he is born and
does his life ministry,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.340 align:middle line:84%
he's later betrayed by
Judas with a kiss, which

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.210 align:middle line:84%
we call the back bite of the
scorpion in the constellation

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:90%
of Scorpio.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Judas betrays him for
30 pieces of silver,

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:84%
but these are really the 30
degrees that Scorpio moves in.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.550 align:middle line:84%
He then faces the
great scales of justice

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
from Libra or the state and
Sagittarius, which is the mob,

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:90%
wants to persecute him.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:84%
At the Last Supper, he
drinks from a cup, which

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
some have called the Holy
Grail, and this is really

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:90%
the Crater constellation.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.550 align:middle line:84%
We see this illustrated
in the famous painting

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:84%
for The Last Supper
by the great master

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci with the
12 signs of the zodiac split

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
into four groups of 3
for the triune nature

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:84%
of the sun in its various
seasons of the year,

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.174 align:middle line:84%
like winter, spring,
summer, and fall.

00:17:06.174 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And to the left of Jesus,
which we're told traditionally

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be John,
is actually a female.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:84%
This represents
Virgo the Virgin.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.099 align:middle line:84%
When we look closer
at this picture,

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:84%
notice the Son of God
or the sun god Jesus.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:84%
In the middle, he has to fish on
his plate representing Pisces.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Check out the trinity of
the sun again with the three

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:90%
doors behind him.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
going on in this picture

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:90%
if you know what to look for.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
After that, Jesus is crucified
with a crown of thorns

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.790 align:middle line:84%
or the coronas of the sun
from December 22nd, 23rd,

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and 24th, which
means the sun stays

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:84%
at the same degree
for three days

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.730 align:middle line:84%
before being resurrected and
coming back to life on the 25th

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:84%
when the sun starts moving
back towards the direction

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:84%
of the northern hemisphere
when he springs back to life

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:90%
at Easter.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.800 align:middle line:84%
The winter solstice
story has also

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.070 align:middle line:84%
been encoded into our megalithic
sites around the world.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite solstice
sites to visit in the world

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.220 align:middle line:84%
is the Newgrange
monument out in Ireland,

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:84%
which is an enormous stone
structure built around 3,800

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:90%
BCE or 5,000 years ago.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:84%
When you visit this site,
there is a sun portal

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:84%
above the door that has a
cross or a crux shaped chamber

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Which keep this in mind, it
was built thousands of years

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.880 align:middle line:84%
before Christianity and
has a solstice alignment

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:84%
that lights up inside only for
the week of the winter solstice

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:middle line:84%
from December 22nd,
23rd, 24th, and 25th.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:10%
It's a big deal to
attend this every year

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle line:10%
and people come from
all over the world

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:10%
to witness this event.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.180 align:middle line:10%
These type of sun portals
and solstice alignments

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:10%
can be found everywhere,
including at Karnak in Egypt,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.190 align:middle line:10%
Chichen Itza in Mexico.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:84%
If that is not evidence
of a global dissemination

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.940 align:middle line:84%
of cultures and sciences that
has existed for thousands

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.730 align:middle line:90%
of years, I don't know what is.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:10%
According to Manly P. Hall's
"Secret Teachings Of All Ages,"

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.170 align:middle line:10%
this myth of the dying god
originally came from Atlantis.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It also serves as part of the
initiatic rites of the mystery

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:84%
schools as it is symbolic of the
transitioning out of the lower

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.520 align:middle line:84%
shadow of the false
self and being raised

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.410 align:middle line:90%
to the higher sphere above us.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Or we could call that
being enlightened.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminded of a beautiful
initiatory passageway

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.580 align:middle line:84%
for the neophyte from "The
Golden Dawn" that was lovingly

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle line:84%
preserved by Dr.
Israel Regardie that

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.950 align:middle line:10%
goes, "Inheritor
of a dying world,

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:10%
we call thee to
the living beauty.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:10%
Wanderer in the
wild darkness, we

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.400 align:middle line:10%
call thee to the gentle light.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.710 align:middle line:10%
Long has thou dwelt in darkness.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.890 align:middle line:10%
Quit the night
and seek the day."

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
In my conversations with author
and esotericist Jay Weidner,

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
he revealed to me that
sometime in the early '90s

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.860 align:middle line:84%
he met with a wealthy,
high ranking Mason

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:84%
from Europe that allowed
him to have access

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.810 align:middle line:84%
to a private library full
of rare and expensive

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.190 align:middle line:90%
esoteric books.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
The only rule was that
he could only read them.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.620 align:middle line:84%
He was not allowed to
take any of them home.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.720 align:middle line:84%
It was there that he
learned about a ritual

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:84%
in French Freemasonry
that is very interesting.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Apparently the
initiate is placed

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:35.840 align:middle line:84%
in a completely dark room for
three days by his brothers

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and told to lie down inside
of a light tight coffin.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:84%
The brothers would then
take the coffin out

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.880 align:middle line:84%
to a hill with a
view of the East.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
They do this right
before the sunrise.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.370 align:middle line:84%
The initiate who
is also blindfolded

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
is taken out of the coffin
and is now facing the East.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
As the first lip of the sun
makes its way over the horizon,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
the blindfold is taken off
the initiate, exposing him

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:90%
to the first light in days.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.460 align:middle line:84%
For the entire
time of the sunrise

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:84%
until the bottom of the
sun has left the horizon,

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:84%
the initiate absorbs
the early morning light.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.090 align:middle line:84%
The initiate is then blindfolded
and placed back in the coffin

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and taken back
into the dark room.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.650 align:middle line:84%
The initiate then
spends the next 40 days

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
completely in the darkness,
just like the Jesus fast

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, which involves
a period of 40 days and 40

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:90%
nights.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Subsequently, this
ritual promises

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.290 align:middle line:90%
long life of the initiate.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:84%
According to Jay Weidner,
what is likely going on here

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:37.250 align:middle line:84%
is that this ritual is designed
to create as much melatonin as

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:38.570 align:middle line:90%
possible in the brain.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.270 align:middle line:84%
We know that melatonin
is a life extender.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.730 align:middle line:10%
By going into the
dark for three days,

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:10%
the initiate creates
a large amount

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:10%
of melatonin in their body.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the pineal gland
secretes two hormones,

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.610 align:middle line:84%
melatonin in the dark and
serotonin in the light.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin is also
closely connected

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.980 align:middle line:84%
to N, N-DMT or
dimethyltryptamine,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.850 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful hallucinogenic
drug on the planet.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:84%
As the initiate
views the sunrise,

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
all of the melatonin
that was created

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:84%
over the three days of
darkness is instantly

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.850 align:middle line:90%
converted to serotonin.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:84%
At that point, the initiate
has to be helped up

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:84%
by his brothers,
because the six or seven

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:84%
minutes of viewing
the rising sun

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
is creating so much
serotonin that it becomes

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:90%
an overwhelming experience.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:10%
By placing the initiative
back inside the dark chamber,

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.980 align:middle line:10%
this blinding dose
of serotonin is then

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.020 align:middle line:10%
converted back to melatonin.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.100 align:middle line:10%
But now the melatonin is
almost a super melatonin.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:84%
According to the latest
scientific research,

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:84%
melatonin is also
what causes our body

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.775 align:middle line:90%
to reverse the aging process.

00:22:42.775 --> 00:22:46.130 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that these
solar initiations came

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.680 align:middle line:84%
from ancient Egypt
originally, and they probably

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:84%
used an empty
sarcophagus in Karnak

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:84%
or someplace where the sun would
align during a solstice period.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.200 align:middle line:10%
We learned about a
similar initiation

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.830 align:middle line:10%
with the death of the Egyptian
god of the underworld, Osiris,

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:10%
who is murdered by
his brother Set, who

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:10%
cuts him into 42 pieces
and takes his phallus off.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:84%
His blood then trickles
down into the ground

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.460 align:middle line:84%
where the sprig of an evergreen,
a tamarisk, or an acacia grows.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is symbolic
of everlasting life.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.670 align:middle line:84%
He is then brought back to
life after three days when

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Isis re-attaches his phallus,
mounts him, and gives birth

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.940 align:middle line:90%
to Horus, the morning sun.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.340 align:middle line:84%
We find this story with
the death of Attis,

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:84%
who became Adonis
from the Phrygians

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and in the Masonic allegories
with Hiram Abiff, who

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:84%
is accosted by three
ruffians and buried

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.930 align:middle line:90%
at the brow of Mount Moriah.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.590 align:middle line:84%
This scene is reenacted by
the initiates of Freemasonry.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:84%
This is also what happens
to Jesus in the Bible

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:84%
as he dies for three days
and comes back to life

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.860 align:middle line:84%
after Mary Magdalene
visits the sepulcher.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.487 align:middle line:10%
The Bible calls the evergreen
that sprouts up a Jesse tree,

00:23:58.487 --> 00:24:01.070 align:middle line:10%
and this is actually where the
tradition of the Christmas tree

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.150 align:middle line:10%
comes from.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.280 align:middle line:84%
The sun's power
in light has been

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.320 align:middle line:84%
understood in countless
different ways

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.970 align:middle line:90%
by secret societies.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Today we talk about
solar eruptions and CMEs.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:10%
But many of our
geologists believe

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:10%
that when we go back to
the Younger Dryas Cataclysm

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:21.570 align:middle line:10%
around 12,800
years ago, this may

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:10%
have been started by a series
of asteroids and solar eruptions

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:10%
causing a destruction
on the Earth,

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.850 align:middle line:10%
including heating up the
sand in the Libyan desert,

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:10%
causing it to turn to glass.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:36.430 align:middle line:84%
In many of the megalithic sites
I've explored around the world

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:39.480 align:middle line:84%
with Brien Foerster,
like Tanis in Egypt,

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.370 align:middle line:84%
it looks like the
whole place has

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:84%
been scorched so badly
with a hot plasma

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.950 align:middle line:84%
that it blew the
place to pieces.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Even the stone has
been burnt very badly

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:90%
with a type of vitrification.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:84%
No agriculture will
actually grow on that site

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:58.410 align:middle line:84%
despite being in a rich
agricultural area with farming

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:90%
communities nearby.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians have
a story that's

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.700 align:middle line:84%
very relevant to
the solar mysteries

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and the cycles of our sun
personified into the goddess

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Hathor.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.260 align:middle line:84%
As the story goes,
Ra grows older

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptians no
longer respect him.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.780 align:middle line:10%
So he has Hathor to
banish the Egyptians who

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.680 align:middle line:10%
are no longer grateful for
all he does in their lives.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.860 align:middle line:10%
But she refuses, because she
loved the ancient Egyptians

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:10%
so much.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So he cast a spell
on her to change her

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:84%
into the lioness
goddess Sekhmet.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:84%
She gets angry with
a furious response

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and starts hunting down
humans and scorching the Earth

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.460 align:middle line:84%
like a CME or a
solar flare eruption.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.390 align:middle line:84%
After that, Ra felt bad and
he wanted Sekhmet to stop,

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:90%
but she wouldn't listen.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So he creates two
shadows, and these

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:84%
are portrayed by two lakes of
wine, which as the story goes,

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
she drinks, falls asleep,
and becomes Hathor again.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But to subdue her
after, he gives her

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.540 align:middle line:84%
a necklace, which is
made from gold, silver,

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and precious jewels which
may in fact be our atmosphere

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and solar systems with
its various planets

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
telling us that the
sun has now come

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.500 align:middle line:90%
to a more calm or stable state.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologist Mohamed
Ibrahim tells me

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:84%
that he thinks these two lakes
represent the layer of shade

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:84%
in the sky that was created
after our last mini ice age

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and helped humans survive
during cooler times.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:84%
According to
mystical traditions,

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.290 align:middle line:84%
the true color of
the sun is blue

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and the orange
yellow color we see

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.630 align:middle line:84%
is just a reflection of its rays
through the substance of our 3D

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:46.590 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Esoteric teachings suggest that
there are actually three suns,

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual sun, the
intellectual sun or soular,

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:59.610 align:middle line:84%
as in S-O-U-L sun,
and the material sun.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Traditionally this is
symbolized in Masonic lodges

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:84%
by the lighting
of three candles.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:84%
It is also taught in
esoteric traditions

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.060 align:middle line:84%
that there are intelligent
beings living in the sun,

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and they have
various hierarchies

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and come and go through that big
fiery ball of gas in the sky.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is where we get
the idea of our sun acting

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:90%
as a portal for higher beings.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.650 align:middle line:84%
These teachings
were later adapted

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.220 align:middle line:84%
into the idea of archangels
or spirits of the light who

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.410 align:middle line:84%
have beautiful
golden white colors

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and are powerful beings
assigned to oversee

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.230 align:middle line:84%
the progress of
our solar system.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:90%
One thing is for certain.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.830 align:middle line:84%
The sun has played
an important role

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.950 align:middle line:84%
in almost every major religion
and tradition in the world.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:46.230 align:middle line:84%
If we learned anything
from these teachings,

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:84%
it's that no matter
how dark it might

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:52.950 align:middle line:84%
get in our lives or the world,
the sun will rise again.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.130 align:middle line:84%
