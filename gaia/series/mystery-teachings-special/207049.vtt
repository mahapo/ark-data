>> I'm Jonny Enoch, and

If you tap on a table or a
hard surface in front of you,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.460 align:middle line:90%
you might think that it's solid.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But when we examine it under
a powerful enough microscope,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.259 align:middle line:84%
we find that it's actually in
a constant state of motion.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:10%
What if all of this-- you, your
life, your home, this world--

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.685 align:middle line:10%
is just a dream that one
day you'll wake up from?

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:90%
[ALARM BEEPING]

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps when we're
dreaming, we're

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:84%
actually waking up
into other realities

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:90%
which is our true state.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminded of the classic
19th century Masonic nursery

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:84%
rhyme about the boats that were
used to build King Solomon's

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:84%
temple that goes, "row,
row, row your boat gently

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.740 align:middle line:84%
down the stream, merrily,
merrily, merrily,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:90%
life is but a dream."

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:84%
We have to ask ourselves, if
we spend most of our lives

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
when we're very young and
when we grow older sleeping

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and dreaming, is this
state of dreamless

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.360 align:middle line:84%
sleepless wakefulness that
you're all in right now any

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:90%
more important?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we know some of
our most ancient cultures

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:84%
on the planet like the
Australian Aborigines

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.400 align:middle line:84%
actually paint and worship
images of their dreams

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.230 align:middle line:90%
and call it dream time.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, our consciousness
is the driving force

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:90%
behind all of this.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is consciousness?

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:84%
We're told traditionally
that consciousness

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:90%
is created in the brain.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.270 align:middle line:84%
But as we'll discuss
later in this episode,

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is a
non-local awareness.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a non-locality
factor to it

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.690 align:middle line:84%
that affects how we decode
our quantum reality.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Your consciousness has layers.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
You can be aware
that you're aware.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.900 align:middle line:84%
You can be aware that you're
aware that you're aware.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
This is your spark, your
laughter, your tears,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:90%
your hopes and fears.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
All of it is the driving force
of your unique, precious,

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:90%
beautiful existence.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.720 align:middle line:84%
One of the hermetic principles
we are taught in the Kybalion

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.490 align:middle line:84%
is that the all is mind,
the universe is mental.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:84%
This is very similar to what
we learn in quantum mechanics

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:84%
from Erwin Schrodinger who
said that the overall number

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:90%
of minds in the universe is one.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Time is a subject bubble
with the eye in the middle,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:84%
just like we hear
from the Moses story

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:84%
when he's told the name
of God is, I am that I

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:90%
am, or Ehyeh in the Hebrew.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
This individual aspect
of us is why many of us

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
are afraid to be alone, but
we're also a part of the whole.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But we have to ask ourselves
then, who is the whole?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Outside of the
egocentric self, there

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.270 align:middle line:84%
is a single sovereign
entity in the universe

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:90%
we're all a part of.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Pythagoras called it the Monad.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
In science, we call
this the unified field.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual people have called it
the source, the great spirit,

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:84%
or God, which comes from the
Germanic "gut", meaning good,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:90%
like God is good.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:10%
India's Guru Nanak, taught
us that we are all one

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:10%
and there's one supreme
power at the source of life

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:10%
as it says in the beginning of
the Sikh scriptures or the Mul

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:10%
Mantar that there is
the Ik Onkar, Ik meaning

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:10%
one, and Onkar meaning God.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the Vedic
writings, the Mundaka Upanishad,

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:90%
teaches us the same thing.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
We find references to the
universal soul in the Bhagavad

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Gita despite the
Hindu belief of there

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
being countless incarnations
of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
We find a similar teaching
of one supreme being in Islam

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.920 align:middle line:84%
when the prophet Muhammad
destroyed the Chaldean idols

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:90%
at Mecca to serve Allah.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Akhenaten turned away
from the priests of Amun

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:84%
to return to the Aten, or we
can look at the biblical version

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:84%
of the story when
Moses was given

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
the edicts of the decalogue or
the Ten Commandments written

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
in stone by the fiery finger of
God in the mountains of Sinai

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
where he's told about
one supreme being.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Gautama Buddha spoke
out against the millions

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:84%
of anthropomorphic gods people
blame for their problems

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:84%
in Nepal and to
take responsibility

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.920 align:middle line:90%
for their own actions.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps polytheism
or multiple gods

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:84%
were not the problems as
such as they are really

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:84%
just personification of divine
principles in human form,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
but these were great
revolts inspired

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
by a longing for the proper use
of universal life principles.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:84%
No matter what name you call
this supreme being or quantum

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:84%
field, it's connected
to everything

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
from the movement of the tiniest
insect wings, a blade of grass

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
covered in dew, and all
the 10 billion trillion

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:84%
infinity to the power of
infinity different life

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:90%
forms in our universe.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But the point of all of
this is that if there

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.250 align:middle line:84%
is a quantum internet
in our universe,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:90%
how are we all connected?

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:10%
We know Nikola Tesla said,
"my brain is only a receiver.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:10%
In the universe, there is a core
from which we obtain knowledge,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:10%
strength, inspiration.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:10%
I've not penetrated into
the secrets of this core,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:10%
but I know it exists."

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.160 align:middle line:10%
Throughout history,
we know there

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:10%
have been various
figures who claim

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:10%
to be able to access a
quantum field of information.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
One of those figures
was Rudolf Steiner,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:84%
who in the 19th century
developed something

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
known as anthroposophy, where
you could tap into this quantum

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
field of information to
help with various inventions

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:84%
or agriculture and
working with medicine.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
We know this is also true
of Walter Russell who

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
in the early 20th century
had the incredible ability

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:84%
to lock himself in a room
and be able to learn how

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
to do sculpting or make
scientific breakthroughs

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.790 align:middle line:90%
and write amazing books.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
We know this is also true of the
Indian mathematician Srinivasa

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Ramanujan who had the
theories we now use

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:84%
today for string theory
come to him in dreams.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:10%
And of course, there was Edgar
Cayce, the sleeping prophet

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:10%
who made thousands of
accurate medical predictions

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:10%
by laying on his back.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know it
doesn't end there

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
as we know there have
been numerous simultaneous

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:84%
inventions and discoveries made
by people at two places at once

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.280 align:middle line:90%
on our planet.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, we look at Isaac
Newton as he found calculus

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:84%
or with the discoveries of
oxygen or the jet engine.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Are we looking at a type
of quantum entanglement

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:90%
where two minds are entangled?

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a field of
information going around

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that
we're always tapping into?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:84%
But every second you might say
you're impregnating reality

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
with your thoughts, we're
shifting to an infinite number

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
of parallel realities as you're
constantly witnessing the birth

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.200 align:middle line:90%
and death of universes.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.020 align:middle line:84%
This is no different than
the mitosis in your body.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Every day, over
50 trillion cells

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:90%
are dying and being regenerated.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
That's over 300
billion a minute.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
This is like the rising of
the Phoenix from the ashes.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the dance of Shiva,
the destroyer of worlds.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the regeneration
of the mother octopus

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
who gives up her body
for her young octopi

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.465 align:middle line:84%
to feed off of her in the
great sympatico of life.

00:07:49.465 --> 00:07:52.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Where does consciousness
come into the picture

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:90%
with all of this?

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps we get a better idea
when we look at the quantum

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:10%
consciousness theory that
we get from Sir Roger

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:10%
Penrose, the famed
British physicist,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:10%
and the esteemed Stuart
Hameroff who specializes in

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:10%
anesthesiology over at
the University of Arizona

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:10%
in Tucson.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:84%
They have hypothesized
that your consciousness

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:84%
is a field of information
that's held together

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.430 align:middle line:84%
through quantum cohesion
or a quantum entanglement.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:10%
And how it works
with our brains is

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:10%
that it can be at
two places at once

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:10%
with that non-locality
factor as that's

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:10%
called super positioning.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
This principle is the
fundamental basics

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:84%
of space-time
geometry and thought

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to be the property of the
very fabric of our universe.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:84%
What's really fascinating
about this is they

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84%
have theorized that these
microtubules in your brain

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:84%
work like a girder system
or a micro-internet

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:84%
to be a cockpit for
your consciousness.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:10%
These are so well-designed
as computational devices

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:10%
that there's organized
cellular activity in our brain

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:10%
that acts like quantum
computers at this level of atoms

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.530 align:middle line:10%
and below.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:84%
According to Stuart
Hameroff, when

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
we look at the EEG rhythms
of your brain waves,

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:84%
those are derived from deeper
level microtubule vibrations.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
in your brain, we

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:90%
have these anharmic vibrations.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So with these
anharmic vibrations,

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:84%
this is the unique song
of your consciousness,

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:84%
this is how in the
future hypothetically,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:84%
we could triangulate
your consciousness,

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:84%
transfer to elsewhere
or locate it

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and it will act
like your IP address

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:84%
when you want to use it on a
quantum communication network.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
But when we talk about decoding
reality, one of the best ways

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:84%
to do that is by looking
at a branch of philosophy

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:90%
known as ontology.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:84%
The definition of
it is the study

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of being becoming
an existence of reality

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:84%
as well as the basic categories
of being and their relations.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, when we
look at one of these matters,

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:84%
we call them an
ontological matter.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the first ideas
we get in this philosophy

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:84%
is that each of us is a unique
constellation of language

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and environmental factors,
meaning that we all

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:84%
have our own vocabularies,
life experiences,

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and cultural influences that
cause us to perceive reality

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:90%
subjectively.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:10%
The great German existential
philosopher Martin Heidegger

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.090 align:middle line:10%
discusses what he calls the
phenomenological aspects

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.270 align:middle line:10%
of self.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
He does this in his
classic work Being and Time

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:84%
where he examined
language and how

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:84%
we use it to perceive
our sense of self

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:90%
and the reality around us.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:84%
This is based on
two main concepts.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:10%
One is called the
Hermeneutical AS, which

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:10%
is a word that we often hear
amongst biblical scholars,

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:10%
and it talks about
how there are so

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.070 align:middle line:10%
many different personal
interpretations of things,

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.990 align:middle line:10%
and it comes from
the word Hermes.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.490 align:middle line:10%
Versus the Apophantical AS
which is the reality that we all

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:10%
perceive collectively.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.110 align:middle line:84%
An example of this would
be that if you walked out

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:84%
into a grocery store parking
lot and you saw someone

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.900 align:middle line:84%
fidgeting with their keys
in front of their car,

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:84%
you might think that the person
is breaking into their car

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.500 align:middle line:84%
but everyone else can
agree on one main reality,

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a guy
trying to get into his car.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So we all have a
different subjective way

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:90%
of interpreting reality.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.780 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what is truth
to me is not truth to another

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
because we all have a different
vehicle of perception.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Understanding comes
before interpretation.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.320 align:middle line:84%
We learn this from a
quantum mechanics principle

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
also with the
relation of objects

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
is as real as the
objects themselves.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.595 align:middle line:84%
So really, reality happens
through you and not to you.

00:11:57.595 --> 00:12:00.150 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
We also know our words have
a sacred geometry to them,

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
hence how we can relate
the word angle to angel

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:90%
in our esoteric teachings.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm reminded of Masaru
Emoto's incredible water study

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:10%
where he showed us the power
of words where he could speak

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.660 align:middle line:10%
to water with words
of love and gratitude

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:10%
and when it would be
frozen, the crystals

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:10%
would have this incredible
geometrical brilliance

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.950 align:middle line:10%
and beauty to them.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:10%
And when he spoke words of
hatred or anger to the water,

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:10%
the crystals were asymmetrical.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
No one can deny that traditions
have existed for thousands

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
of years that teach the powerful
psychological integration

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:90%
benefits of prayer.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:84%
But when we examine our
ancient religious texts,

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
they're more than just
beautiful sounding accounts

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:90%
of historicity.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if you look
in the scriptures of the Buddha,

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:84%
the Hindu Upanishads,
the Bible, or the Quran,

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.030 align:middle line:84%
they all emphasize
the power of prayer.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
In recent years, the
healing power of prayer

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:84%
was studied by a
Catholic scientist named

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Boguslaw who proved
it works by measuring

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic fields
around people who are praying

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:90%
using an electroscope.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.380 align:middle line:84%
He compared recovery
times of patients

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.490 align:middle line:84%
in hospitals being prayed
over versus ones who were not.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:84%
He was absolutely
stunned to discover

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.280 align:middle line:84%
that the ones who were
prayed over recovered faster.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:84%
This is not unlike what we have
seen with epigenetics experts

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.170 align:middle line:84%
like Dr. Joe Dispenza and
Dr. Bruce Lipton who tell us

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:84%
that your thoughts are
literally translated

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:84%
into your DNA and
the chemistry that

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.430 align:middle line:90%
determines what you become.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
In other words, energy
follows thought and thoughts

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:90%
become things.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:84%
If we look at this using
quantum principles,

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
there's something known
as the observable effect,

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:84%
with Schrodinger's dictum or
the double slit experiment,

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
proving that once again, we
are creating our reality.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:84%
But what more is this
reality than a series

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
of neurological and
physiological discharges

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.920 align:middle line:84%
in fact, each of
you watching this

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.140 align:middle line:84%
has a unique neurophysiology
and biodiversity,

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:84%
which means that each of you has
a different biological vehicle

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:90%
of perception.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it works.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Everything we see
in our world is

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.120 align:middle line:84%
vibrating at various frequencies
and interpreted by our brain

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.800 align:middle line:90%
through our eyes as stimulus.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And you could say the
divine has a sense of humor

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.358 align:middle line:84%
because everything you
look at is upside down.

00:14:36.358 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:10%
This is because the
front part of your eyes

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:10%
are curved and bend the light
making an upside down image

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:10%
on our retina, which the
brain has to turn around.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:10%
The light travels
along your optic nerve

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:52.370 align:middle line:10%
as electrical impulses and finds
its way to our occipital lobe.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:10%
This lobe is composed
of two visual cortices

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.850 align:middle line:10%
and connects to the frontal
lobe processing the signal

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:10%
into information, just
like you're doing right

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:10%
now while watching the show.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:90%
But here's the amazing part.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Your brain doesn't download
the objects around us

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
as strings or even
subatomic particles.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it processes these
items in our frequency range

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
so they can form vivid
pictures in your brain.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
This is due to the
photoreceptors in our pupils,

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:84%
which are limited by your
brain to only recognize

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:84%
light vibrations of the
electromagnetic spectrum

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:33.290 align:middle line:84%
between 390 to 750
nanometers, which

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:84%
is 100 billionth of a meter
just in case you're wondering.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
However, when we examine
wavelengths outside

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.760 align:middle line:84%
of our visible light
spectrum such as infrared

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and ultraviolet,
there's a whole lot more

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.990 align:middle line:90%
going on than we ever imagine.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And one day we can expect to
discover that we are literally

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:56.150 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by a vast sea of
multidimensional intelligences,

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:84%
astral wildlife,
and life forms that

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:84%
feed off of different types
of electromagnetic energies.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:10%
In fact, we are
now experimenting

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:10%
with upgrading our eyes
by injecting nanoparticles

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:10%
into the eyeballs of rats.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:10%
And just in case you're
wondering what nanoparticles

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.700 align:middle line:10%
are, these are
these little silicon

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:10%
hexagonal structures
made of graphene that

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.050 align:middle line:10%
can be injected into the body.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.790 align:middle line:10%
So with these particles
going into our eyes,

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:10%
they've been used for
night vision experiments

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:10%
and now they're going
to be used to upgrade

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:10%
our vision into the infrared.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the fathers of quantum
mechanics Niels Bohr said,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
"everything we call real is
made of things that cannot be

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:90%
regarded as real."

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
understand this reality,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:84%
we have to go down
to the tiniest minute

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.170 align:middle line:90%
particles known as atoms.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
When we examine the atom,
we find this electron

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.820 align:middle line:90%
whizzing around the nucleus.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.170 align:middle line:10%
And if we use atom smashers
and particle accelerators,

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:10%
we find these funny
sounding little things

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:10%
called subatomic particles like
quarks, neutrinos, hadrons,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:10%
leptons.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:84%
By the time you get down
to gluons and bosons,

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:84%
we're told that they're
made of pure photonic energy

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:84%
with no masks and
we're told now by some

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.579 align:middle line:84%
of our theoretical
physicists that you

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:84%
could fit an entire
galaxy into one of those

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:84%
since atoms are made
of mostly blank spaces.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:84%
That means if our
world currently

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:84%
has nearly 8 billion
people living on it,

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
we can literally fit them all
at the end of our pinky finger.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:84%
That's just to give you
a little perspective

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:37.520 align:middle line:84%
on the spatial dynamics
of our universe.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And atoms get even stranger
when we look at harmonics.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, it takes
very little energy

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
to change the vibration
of atoms in your body.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Harmonics could be
dangerous, though,

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.890 align:middle line:84%
especially if we change
the atoms in your body

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:84%
so they're not relative
to the ground below you.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:84%
You would literally
sink right into the dirt

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.660 align:middle line:84%
or find yourself in the
middle of the Earth.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.200 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with relativity
and spatial momentum

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:90%
or the spin of atoms.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Harmonics could also be used
to affect or manipulate gravity

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.500 align:middle line:84%
allowing us to
materialize out of walls

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.350 align:middle line:84%
or float over the
floor, interfere

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.710 align:middle line:84%
with the subjective reality
that we are perceiving.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.960 align:middle line:84%
You might say a more
subtle way of doing

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:84%
this is what our traditional
spiritual practices of how you

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:84%
could change the
resonance of a room

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
by burning sage or using certain
essential oils, singing bowls,

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:90%
and chanting.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Remember, who used to be
thought of as the talk of quacks

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and charlatans with the idea of
dimensions and other universes

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.940 align:middle line:84%
is now the subject of
serious scientific inquiry.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.270 align:middle line:84%
One theory that has become
very popular in recent years

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:84%
is looking at our reality and
our universe as a simulation.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:10%
Many scientists like Nick
Bostrom and David Baum

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:10%
claim we live in a simulation
in our universe works

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:10%
like a hologram with
subatomic particles.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:10%
Michael Talbot
gives us an example

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:10%
of this in the
Holographic Universe

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.920 align:middle line:10%
with my story about
a man named Tom

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.680 align:middle line:10%
at a party who was
put under hypnosis

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:10%
and told that his daughter
Laura was invisible.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
They held a pocket
watch up to her back

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and he could accurately
see through her

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and read the inscription
on the back of the watch.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I've witnessed this
many times myself

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:84%
practicing clinical hypnotherapy
over the years where someone's

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.990 align:middle line:84%
been told that an object or
a person is not in the room

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and they will walk by them or
it as if they're completely

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:90%
oblivious to the situation.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:84%
What does that tell you about
how we decode our reality?

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So instead of us
saying that we live

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.340 align:middle line:84%
in a binary universe with
light and dark matter,

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that we
have this trinary state?

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Is there a third, invisible,
anti-matter state?

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Is this what's affecting
the spin of atoms?

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Is this what's affecting
the spin that we're

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.230 align:middle line:90%
told in our chakras of planets?

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps our universe
is synergistically

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:90%
spinning with other universes.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminded of the theories
that Nassim Haramein puts out

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:84%
about the importance of
looking at the spin of atoms.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps we can tap
into other dimensions

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:84%
by looking at angular momentum
or the angle or the way

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.250 align:middle line:90%
that the atom spins.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Another concept that
comes into our awareness

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.960 align:middle line:90%
is that we live in a multiverse.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:10%
We know now through
using something

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:10%
known as the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe or the WMAP

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.200 align:middle line:10%
scan for short, it's
a lot easier to say,

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.630 align:middle line:10%
that if we look at the
radioactive background

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:10%
scan of our universe,
we see that there

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:10%
is this circuitous pattern in
the background of our universe

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:10%
showing that we've had either
multiple, multiple big bangs

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.950 align:middle line:10%
or multiple
expansions to show us

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:10%
that our universe is
constantly growing.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, now what we believe
in our theoretical physics

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.670 align:middle line:84%
is that we are just a little
bubble living in a vast ocean

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:90%
full of universes.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, what's
very interesting

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:84%
about this is our
scientists tell us

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.580 align:middle line:84%
that these scans have
revealed that our universe is

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:90%
in the shape of a dodecahedron.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is that interesting?

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, Plato tells
us in his Timaeus

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that the cosmos are in the
shape of a dodecahedron

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'd ask you, how
did Plato know that?

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.160 align:middle line:10%
According to theoretical
physicist Michio Kaku,

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:10%
in the event that a universe
has reached its maturation,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:10%
an advanced
civilization would be

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:10%
able to create a baby
universe on the surface

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:10%
of our bubble-like universe
acting as a lifeboat

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:54.350 align:middle line:10%
to transport them to a younger
and more vibrant universe.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Another theory
that's been suggested

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.390 align:middle line:84%
is that if we use a
powerful enough laser

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:84%
we could tear a hole in
the fabric of spacetime,

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:84%
inject it full of nanobots
to make it bigger,

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and travel through to the other
side and reach other universes.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Inside of each of you, there
is a mental coordinator

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:84%
or gatekeeper and it works
like our digestive system

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:90%
with your esophageal sphincter.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:90%
It holds everything in.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:84%
If too much comes through,
it's like a psychic acid reflux

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
and can be very uncomfortable
changing your personality

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
and ego which in
that case meditation

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.540 align:middle line:84%
might be your only
remedy like an antacid.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
We're all hardwired to
perceive so much more,

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:84%
including profoundly
amazing psychic abilities

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
like remote viewing and
mediumship which many of you

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
might already have a
genetic disposition towards

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:90%
or experienced before.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But we all have the means
to develop these things

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.210 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I was once told by
a master teacher

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.790 align:middle line:84%
a technique for
unlocking the gatekeeper.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, all you have to
do is find a place of peace

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and quietude where you won't be
disturbed and stare at a spot

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:84%
on the wall for
just three seconds

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
without anything coming into
your mind as a distraction.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And while it might sound easy,
it's actually very difficult

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.410 align:middle line:90%
to achieve this.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:84%
If done correctly, you will
unlock another perception

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:90%
of your being.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
quantum spirituality,

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.780 align:middle line:84%
we're really talking
about the illusion

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.090 align:middle line:90%
that reality is linear.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Time is like a river.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.750 align:middle line:84%
You can never step
in the same spot

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:84%
twice because it's
constantly moving forward.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Truth be told,
reality is non-linear

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.370 align:middle line:84%
as your past, present and
future lives are all happening

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:90%
right now in simultaneity.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And in theory, if you
wanted to go back and live

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:84%
in the time of let's
say Cleopatra the 7th,

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:84%
you could theoretically
incarnate back then

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and interact with them if
all the players were game.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.980 align:middle line:84%
The universe is constantly
growing, evolving,

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and expanding, breaking
off into infinite amounts

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:84%
of different timelines and
realities in every direction.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Remember, reality is
what you make of it.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jonny Enoch and thanks for
watching Mystery Teachings.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.483 align:middle line:90%
