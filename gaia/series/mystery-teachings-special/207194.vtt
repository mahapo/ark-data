00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.670 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Jonny Enoch, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.120 align:middle line:10%
If I mentioned Pythagoras
to most of you,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:10%
you'd probably
start thinking back

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:10%
to when you were in
math class in school

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:10%
and learned about
Pythagoras' theorem,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:10%
or a squared plus b
squared equals c squared.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:10%
That's when you
have a triangle that

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:10%
has a 90-degree or right
angle, and you make squares

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:10%
on each side of
those three sides.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Then we discover that
the largest square

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
has an identical sized area
to the other squares combined.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:84%
But Pythagoras was much
more than a mathematician.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:84%
He was a mathemagician,
or an esotericist

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:90%
and a great thinker.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So for those reasons,
we will be talking

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
very little about his math
skills on this episode,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and more about his profound
wisdom and teachings.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras lived
between 570 and 495 BCE,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and is regarded today
as a Greek philosopher

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:90%
and founder of Pythagoreanism.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Well before he established his
first Pythagorean community,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:84%
he was already known as
a great mathematician.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Without a doubt, Pythagoras was
one of the most intelligent men

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:90%
of his time.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, his views
and philosophies

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
influenced other
great philosophers,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:90%
like Plato and Aristotle.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:84%
In truth, he is said to
have greatly affected

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Western thought.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.620 align:middle line:84%
He established his now
famous school at Crotone

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.505 align:middle line:84%
in the South of
Italy about 529 BCE.

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And in a short period
of time, disciples

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
flocked to him from all
over Greece, and even Italy.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras centered many of his
teachings around mathematics.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.440 align:middle line:84%
However, he also taught
the spiritual philosophies

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:84%
of metempsychosis, or
the passing of the soul

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:84%
after death into
another body, as well as

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
divination and magic, a practice
he picked up in his Magi

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:90%
training in Babylon.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps not known to
many people today,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.810 align:middle line:84%
he was a strong believer
in reincarnation,

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:84%
as this was a topic he
discussed at great length

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:90%
with his students.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:84%
He was also a firm believer in
the mystical power of numbers.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.550 align:middle line:10%
As a geometrician, which
is an expert on geometry,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:10%
he was said to have invented
several math problems, most

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:10%
notably the 47th
problem of Euclid,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:10%
which is a symbol
well-respected in the mysteries.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Another area of
interest to him was

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:84%
the mathematical
relationship to music.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Once again, this is
another key component

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:90%
of the mystery schools.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:10%
Nevertheless, Pythagoras
disdained many of the sages

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:10%
from his time period.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.240 align:middle line:84%
He considered them vain
and overly dogmatic

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
in their lifestyle
and instructions.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
As a result, he simply
proclaimed himself as a seeker

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
after knowledge, not
the possessor of it.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:84%
This new way of thinking
took everyone by surprise.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:84%
He was simply a lover of
wisdom, and willingly shared it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
with anyone who
joined his school.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
In order to become a
member of his order,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.900 align:middle line:84%
disciples had to wear the
simplest kinds of clothing.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
They also had to surrender
all individual property

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:90%
upon arrival.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.220 align:middle line:84%
This was followed by living
three years in poverty.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And they had to adhere
to rigorous silence.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, although
vegetarianism was encouraged,

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.030 align:middle line:84%
meat eating was allowed,
although minimally.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras believed
that when you ate meat,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:90%
it clouded your judgment.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:84%
He also taught his
followers that friendship

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:84%
was the truest and most
perfect of relationships.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
There were two types
of studies he offered,

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:90%
esoteric and exoteric.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Exoteric instruction related
to general ethical teachings,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
while esoteric constituted
Pythagoras' core directives

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge that he
picked up in Egypt.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras called his
students [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:90%
or his companions and friends.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Much like those in
secret societies

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:84%
today, the school conducted
rigorous scrutiny rituals

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:84%
in order to discover
character flaws,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and also required an
oath as preparation

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.140 align:middle line:90%
in its secret teachings.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Most interestingly, if
a companion of the order

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:84%
decided to return to the
world, the other disciples

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.930 align:middle line:84%
held a funeral for them
and left a monument

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:84%
to their memory, for that person
was considered dead to them.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, before
he created his school,

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Pythagoras traveled extensively.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Oddly enough, it all
started in his youth,

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
when he traveled with his
father, who was a gem merchant.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.110 align:middle line:84%
This early experience
would eventually

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:90%
pay dividends for the young man.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Once his family settled
down on the island of Samos,

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Pythagoras began his studies.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:10%
He first studied with the
philosopher Pherecydes,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:10%
followed by a stint with
the astronomer Thales when

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:10%
he was just 18 years old.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Thales recommended that
Pythagoras travel to Egypt

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.490 align:middle line:84%
to learn more of these esoteric
subjects and the mysteries.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras was first
initiated into the Mysteries

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:84%
of Tyre in Byblos before
arriving in Egypt.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.480 align:middle line:84%
But upon his arrival,
he soon discovered

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptian
mystery schools would not

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.240 align:middle line:84%
admit him unless he
completed a 40-day fast.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.760 align:middle line:84%
This is similar to what
we were told in the Bible

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus experienced
in the desert.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a well-known spiritual
purification practice, which,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
according to the French
esotericist Éliphas Lévi should

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:84%
only be performed
once every 50 years.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:10%
So after performing
this 40-day fast,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:10%
he was allowed to enter
the school at Diospolis.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:10%
Pythagoras was said to
have stated, "you are not

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:10%
allowing Pythagoras in.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:10%
I am a different man.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.100 align:middle line:10%
I am reborn.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:10%
You were right, and I
was wrong, because then

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:10%
my whole standpoint
was intellectual.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:10%
Through this purification, my
center of being has changed.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.580 align:middle line:10%
Before this training,
I could only

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:10%
understand through the
intellect, through the head.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.380 align:middle line:10%
Now I can feel.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Now truth is not a concept
to me, but a life."

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.980 align:middle line:84%
After this
experience, Pythagoras

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
spent the next 22 years
perfecting his crafts

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.630 align:middle line:84%
in mathematics, music,
astronomy, magic,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptian and
Babylonian mysteries.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.100 align:middle line:10%
Most interestingly,
Pythagoras became a prisoner

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:10%
when Cambyses II, the king
of Persia, attacked Egypt.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:10%
As a detainee in Babylon,
he took the opportunity

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.980 align:middle line:10%
to study from the Magi, and
was initiated into the Chaldean

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:10%
mysteries.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
After leaving
Babylon, he eventually

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
made his way through
Persia to India,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.140 align:middle line:84%
where he resumed his
education under the Brahmins.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It is said that he went
to India as a student,

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:84%
but left the country
as Pitar Guru

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and as Yavanacharya,
the Ionian teacher.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, because of his
travels, Pythagoras

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.560 align:middle line:84%
did not return home until
he was 56 years of age.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And upon his arrival, he
discovered that his island home

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
was in ruin, with its
temples and schools closed

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:84%
due to the oppression of the
Persian captors of the day.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Realizing he was not welcomed,
he left and went to Italy.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:10%
Incredibly, the people
were so impressed

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.030 align:middle line:10%
with him and his knowledge,
they soon decided to build him

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:10%
a school, which served
as a school of philosophy

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:10%
and science.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:84%
This school was modeled around
the mystery schools of Egypt.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:10%
As we mentioned
earlier, his followers

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:10%
lived a strict disciplinary
life in accordance

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:10%
with the great mystery
schools during that time.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And there were three
levels of initiation,

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:84%
just like many of our
ancient initiatory rites.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many secret
societies credit

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras for
starting their order.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:84%
According to Albert Mackey's
"Encyclopedia of Freemasonry,"

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:84%
when we go back to the time of
the 16th-century king of Henry

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:84%
VIII and his six
wives, we learn that he

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
was trying to get a divorce from
his wife, Catherine of Aragon,

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:84%
because she couldn't
produce for him a male heir.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he wanted to marry the
young, pretty, and intelligent

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:90%
Anne Boleyn.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But no matter what he tried,
even with the help of Cardinal

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Wolsey, the Catholic
Church kept telling

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:84%
him no due to political
reasons of the day that

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:90%
involved her family.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So he decided to get a
divorce from the church

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:84%
instead with the help of a
lawyer named Thomas Cromwell.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.680 align:middle line:84%
This incident became
very famously known

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:90%
as the English Reformation.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.380 align:middle line:84%
At that time, he sent out a
man named John Leland, who

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:84%
would go to all the
Catholic monasteries

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and decide what books they
wanted to keep before they

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:90%
burned the places down.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.780 align:middle line:84%
That is when he stumbled on a
very interesting and old book

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.530 align:middle line:84%
entitled "What Are the
Origins of Freemasonry?"

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you opened up the pages
of this dusty old manuscript,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
it said inside that
their order was founded

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:90%
by Peter Gower the Grecian.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this is an
Anglicization of Pythagoras.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras taught
that the Earth was

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
a sphere at the center
of the universe,

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and that the moon was inclined
to the Earth's equator.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:10%
Furthermore, he was one
of the first to discover

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:10%
that Venus was perceived
as an evening star

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:10%
and then a planet
as the morning star.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
He employed music
in his instruction.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
He called it "the
music of the spheres."

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And this was replicated by the
use of an instrument called

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:90%
a monochord.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.220 align:middle line:84%
He was also the first
to call the heavens

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:90%
a universe and the Earth round.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:10%
Pythagoras taught and firmly
believed that, number one,

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:10%
at its deepest level, reality
is mathematical in nature;

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:10%
number two, that
philosophy can be

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:10%
used for spiritual
purification; and number three,

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:10%
that the soul can rise
to union with the divine;

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:10%
number four, that
certain symbols have

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:10%
a mystical significance;
and number five,

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.180 align:middle line:10%
all members of the order
should observe strict loyalty

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:10%
and secrecy.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But of course, he believed
in and taught the principles

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:84%
of immortality, which include an
understanding that the soul is

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:84%
immortal, which means it
changes from body to body

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and reincarnations,
inevitably something

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
he learned from his travels
to India, Babylon, and Egypt.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:10%
Also, Pythagoras
openly discussed

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:10%
how he lived numerous
past lives, one of which

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:10%
was being the son of Hermes,
who is named Aethalides.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.580 align:middle line:84%
As the story goes, Hermes
promised Aethalides,

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:84%
or Pythagoras, any
gift he desired,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and he chose to remember
everything after death,

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.660 align:middle line:90%
which was granted to him.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras also
believed that anyone

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:84%
who could remember
their past lives

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:90%
was a highly advanced soul.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.630 align:middle line:10%
Consequently,
Pythagoras recalled

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:10%
all of his previous
lives thereafter,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.390 align:middle line:10%
like the time when he saw
a war shield on the wall

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:10%
and remembered his
life as Euphorbus.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.530 align:middle line:10%
In this life, he was a soldier
who fought in the Trojan War.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
When asked to offer proof
of his previous existences,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
he told his disciples to
pull the shield down and look

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:84%
for the name he
previously mentioned.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.590 align:middle line:10%
Pythagoras cried profusely
while his students

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:10%
stood in amazement.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:10%
It is clear from the
teachings of Pythagoras

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:10%
that he was completely familiar
with the principles of Asiatic

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:10%
and Occidental esotericism.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:10%
In truth, he
traveled and studied

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:10%
with many of the ancient
mystery cultures of the day,

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:10%
including the
Jewish philosophers,

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:10%
who we are told instructed
him in the rabbinical secret

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:10%
traditions of Moses.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Some people even believe he
was a disciple of Zoroaster.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And although accounts of his
travels differ significantly,

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.350 align:middle line:84%
historians for the
most part agree

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.570 align:middle line:84%
that he visited many
countries and studied

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:84%
at the feet of
many great masters.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
There are, of course, many
legends about Pythagoras.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest is
perhaps his own immortalism.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Many people maintain that
he was no mortal man.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they
thought of him as one

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
of the gods who had
taken on a human body

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:84%
to enable him to come into
this world to instruct us.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Pythagoras was one of
the numerous sages and saviors

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.810 align:middle line:84%
of antiquity for whom
an immaculate conception

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.370 align:middle line:90%
is asserted.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:10%
In his "Anacalypsis,"
Godfrey Higgins writes,

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:10%
"The first striking
circumstance in which

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:10%
the history of Pythagoras
agrees with the history of Jesus

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:10%
is that they were natives
of nearly the same country,

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:10%
the former being born at
Sidon, the latter at Bethlehem,

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:10%
both in Syria."

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:10%
He goes on to say, "The
father of Pythagoras, as well

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:10%
as the father of Jesus,
was prophetically

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:10%
informed that his wife
should bring forth

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.990 align:middle line:10%
a son, who should be a
benefactor to mankind.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:10%
They were both born
when their mothers were

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.900 align:middle line:10%
from home on journeys,
Joseph and his wife

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:10%
having gone up to
Bethlehem to be taxed,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.640 align:middle line:10%
and the father of
Pythagoras having

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:10%
traveled from Samos,
his residence,

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:19.690 align:middle line:10%
to Sidon, about his
mercantile concerns."

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, not
everyone appreciated

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Pythagoras or his teachings.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, one of his students
became very disgruntled at him

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:84%
after he was rejected
as a student,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
so that man spread false
rumors about Pythagoras

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:90%
and turned a mob against him.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And so they murdered
him and his followers,

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and burned his school and all
their buildings to the ground.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, there
are similarities here

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.840 align:middle line:90%
between Pythagoras and Jesus.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Not only did he have
disciples, but he

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
was also known by the same name
titles, such as the Son of God,

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and was crucified
in a similar way.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
This has caused many
scholars to assume

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps the story of
Jesus might partially be based

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:90%
on the life of Pythagoras.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Many occultists in
the ancient world

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.380 align:middle line:84%
had astonishing insight into
the principles of evolution.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:84%
They fully accepted
that all life

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.220 align:middle line:84%
is existing in various stages
of growth and becoming,

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
like that of the
grains of sand, which

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:84%
are in the course of becoming
human in consciousness,

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:90%
but not necessarily in form.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.520 align:middle line:84%
In a like manner,
human creatures

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
were in the process of becoming
planets, and that planets were

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:84%
in the processes of
becoming solar systems,

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and that solar systems were
in the processes of becoming

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
cosmic chains, and
so on and so forth.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Correspondingly,
one of the stages

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:84%
between the solar system
and the cosmic chain

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:90%
was called the zodiac.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Hence, it was taught
that at a certain time,

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:84%
a solar system breaks
up into a zodiac.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, the
house of the zodiac

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.450 align:middle line:84%
became the thrones for the
12 celestial hierarchies,

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
or, as certain of the ancients
stated, the 10 divine orders.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Even so, know that the
first 10 numbers were

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:90%
of particular significance.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:10%
Together, these numbers
form the tetractys,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:10%
a triangular figure
consisting of 10 points

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:10%
arranged in 4 rows, 1, 2,
3, and 4 points in each row.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:84%
This was also an image of the
formed and the eternal realms.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I have discussed the
tetractys and this subject

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:84%
at length with best-selling
Lebanese author

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and esotericist Karim El Koussa,
who wrote the book "Pythagoras

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:90%
the Mathemagician."

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.380 align:middle line:84%
He told me that in the
first five numbers,

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.110 align:middle line:84%
we find a secret
path of initiation,

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:90%
which are as follows.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:84%
We start at one as the
divine force of creation

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, also
known as the Great Monad,

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:84%
or you could say this is
a sexless, omnipresent,

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
all-powerful, supreme
force of creation.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.950 align:middle line:84%
The number two-- we
present this as the dyad.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the dualistic
principle of the created,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:84%
manifested world, the break
of unity, if you will.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.270 align:middle line:10%
The role of the initiate
is thus to escape

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:10%
the evil deed of the
dyad and the illusion

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.190 align:middle line:10%
of the physical
world by embracing

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:10%
number three, the triad.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.630 align:middle line:10%
This is just like the
Rosicrucian teaching

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:10%
of the triangle, but it
is through performing

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.320 align:middle line:10%
a harmonious balance in this
triune nature of mind, body,

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:10%
and spirit.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:10%
When this successfully
transpires,

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:10%
the initiate then consciously
enters the realm of number

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:48.650 align:middle line:10%
four, the sacred tetrad, where
the crucifixion of its four

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:10%
natural elements-- air,
fire, water, and earth--

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:10%
takes place before ultimately
reaching the resurrection

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:10%
of its ethereal being into
the sphere of number five,

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.110 align:middle line:10%
the pentad.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:10%
This symbol is not
only the secret sign

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:10%
that was used by
the Pythagoreans

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.720 align:middle line:10%
to identify themselves
to each other,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:10%
but it also symbolized a
reconciliation and concord.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
It was later symbolized
by Leonardo da Vinci

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:84%
in his "Vitruvian Man," because
it represents the human being

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.390 align:middle line:90%
with all the elements.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.480 align:middle line:84%
The penta- is also where
you get the pentagram from

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:90%
or the five-pointed star.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Not only is this the
pattern that Venus moves in,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.680 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's
very fascinating

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that the ancients knew that, and
they associated it with Venus.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.803 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:44.803 --> 00:18:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.650 align:middle line:10%
But the pentagram also
symbolizes the human being,

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:10%
because it has all of
the elements in it,

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.480 align:middle line:10%
with spirit facing up.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:10%
Then, when you
move clockwise, we

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:04.490 align:middle line:10%
have water, fire, earth,
and air on its other points.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I do want to add that
in occult traditions,

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
this symbol has been used
for protection, banishing,

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and invocations when drawn
upright from various corners.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
However, some associate this
symbol with negative uses

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
when it has been inverted,
as not only do some groups

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:84%
superimpose a Baphomet or a
goat-like devil's head over it,

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:84%
but another way of interpreting
the inverted pentagram

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
is that you are placing spirit
descending downwards in putting

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:84%
all the earthly or
material elements first

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:90%
by this configuration.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:10%
We also find the inverted
pentagram and these principles

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:10%
demonstrated in the Devil
card in the Tarot, as often,

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:53.000 align:middle line:10%
you see that this symbol is
above a man and a woman who

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:10%
are chained to all the earthly
and material trappings.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But aside from the five numbers
according to Pythagoras,

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.170 align:middle line:84%
let us continue on to six, which
was the first perfect number,

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.930 align:middle line:84%
representing a state
of health and balance.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Seven represents virginity,
as it cannot be divided by any

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:90%
other number other than itself.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:90%
It brings order to nature.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Eight is associated with
safety and steadfastness,

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:84%
balancing and regulating
everything in the universe.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Nine brings things to fruition.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Number 10-- Pythagoras
taught that 10, or the deca,

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest of
all numbers, for it

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
holds the universe
together and manifests

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.660 align:middle line:90%
all the laws of nature.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It is also represented
by the Roman numeral

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:46.080 align:middle line:84%
X, which is a cross, meaning
that we graduate from the nine

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:84%
months of pregnancy into life
when we add another number.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
You see, Pythagoras
believed the universe

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.060 align:middle line:84%
to be an immense monochord,
as previously mentioned.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.030 align:middle line:84%
He contended that with a
single string connected

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.480 align:middle line:84%
to its upper end existed
the absolute spirit,

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and at its lower end
was absolute matter.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Strictly speaking,
a cord stretched

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:84%
between heaven and Earth, like
that of the silver cord, which,

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:84%
according to the Bible and
reports from astral projectors,

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
connects us to our astral
selves and physical bodies

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:90%
if we're out of the body.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:84%
By the same token,
Pythagoras contended

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that when one counts inward
from the circumference

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:84%
of the heavens, the universe
is divided into nine parts.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.390 align:middle line:84%
However, others believed
there were to be 12.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.230 align:middle line:84%
In addition, Pythagoras believed
in the doctrine of opposites,

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and that the greatest
substances were

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:84%
both material and
immaterial and are numbered,

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:84%
which have two different
but complementary facets,

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
like the physical and the
abstract being individualized

00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:84%
as dyads, or left and
right, or male and female.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, because
Pythagoras initiates

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
were sworn to
secrecy and nothing

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:84%
taught was ever written down,
most of the inner workings

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.660 align:middle line:84%
of his numbered philosophy were
lost within a few generations

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:90%
after his demise.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.250 align:middle line:10%
History has determined that
while the early Chinese,

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:10%
Persians, Hindus, Israelites,
Egyptians, and Greeks

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:10%
used both vocal and
instrumental music

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:10%
in their religious
ceremonies, Pythagoras

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:10%
lifted the art to
its true grandeur

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.010 align:middle line:10%
by displaying its
mathematical foundations.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.950 align:middle line:84%
In truth, he is now
praised for his discovery

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.900 align:middle line:84%
of the seven-note musical scale
that we use in Western music.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
As mentioned
previously, he first

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:84%
learned the divine
theory of music

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
from the priests of
the various mystery

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:90%
schools he had participated in.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Yet, not being
satisfied, Pythagoras

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
contemplated the laws governing
consonance and dissonance

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:90%
for quite a few years as well.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:84%
He eventually realized that the
vibrations made by the hammers

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:84%
were all distinct, but
that, except for one,

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.360 align:middle line:90%
they were in ideal harmony.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:84%
While observing the
fourth and fifth octaves,

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:84%
he noticed there was a
dissonance between them.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:84%
After careful
observation and study,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.900 align:middle line:84%
he found that the tone depended
on the weight of the objects.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:84%
These discoveries
eventually led to Pythagoras

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:84%
being able to cure ailments
of the soul, mind, and body.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:84%
He used several specifically
prepared musical compositions

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:84%
played in the presence of the
sufferer with proven outcomes.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
As a result, based on
what we've learned so far,

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:41.110 align:middle line:84%
can you see why Pythagoras was
considered in such high regard?

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, he was a scholar and
a philosopher like no other.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:48.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, other great men
merely stand in his shadow.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.710 align:middle line:84%
He lived in a time
of mystery, where

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.900 align:middle line:84%
the physical body,
like all of nature,

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.320 align:middle line:84%
was considered a marvel
of divine interactions.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
He not only studied
it, he lived it.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:84%
We know he studied at many
of the great mystery schools

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and with the Magi
of Babylon, which

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.380 align:middle line:90%
would make him a magician.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras was a magician
of the highest order,

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and, like all
great magicians, he

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.550 align:middle line:90%
attempted to understand nature.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras more than likely
used herbs for medicine,

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.370 align:middle line:84%
like all magicians did
during that period.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.790 align:middle line:84%
This practice is as
old as time itself.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.880 align:middle line:84%
People who were sick would
go to a magician, who

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:84%
would make a potion
made of herbal medicine,

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.840 align:middle line:90%
much like herbalists do today.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, the first
important area of the Magi

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.040 align:middle line:84%
was his ability
to read the stars.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we know he studied the
heavens, much like Pythagoras

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:84%
learned in his youth and
performed and perfected

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.420 align:middle line:90%
throughout his life.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:84%
They studied the
gods and the stars,

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:84%
two concepts that
were inseparable

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:84%
from all of the Magi and
Mesopotamian culture.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Without a doubt, magic was
connected to one or the other,

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.550 align:middle line:90%
and many times both.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.620 align:middle line:84%
We find that magic
rituals were often

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
related to the incantation
of the gods, who were likened

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.960 align:middle line:84%
to star constellations
seen in the night sky,

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:84%
including the planets,
like the sun and moon.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:84%
It was actually
a matter of faith

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.320 align:middle line:84%
that the gods had moved from
the Earth to the heavens

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and were indistinguishable
to certain constellations,

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.710 align:middle line:84%
planets, or other
phenomena in nature.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.620 align:middle line:84%
These stars were seen
as the intermediaries

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:90%
between the gods and man.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:84%
They were thought to
influence everything,

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
especially when
asked for favors.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.050 align:middle line:84%
In all actuality,
the stars were even

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.990 align:middle line:84%
used to ward off evil
spirits, and were often prayed

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:90%
to as a result.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Another skill learned by
Pythagoras was plant medicine.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.550 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, this practice

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.670 align:middle line:84%
was widespread in
Mesopotamia as well.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.520 align:middle line:84%
They had access to a
long list of plants,

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:84%
which gave the
names of the plants,

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and how they were to
be primed, and what

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:84%
illnesses they were to be
used for, and in what way.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:10%
Plants could be dispensed

ground, used as a potion with
beer or oil, and as a poultice.

Pythagoras was not only an
astronomer, a mathematician,

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:84%
a philosopher, a student
of the mystery schools

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:18.360 align:middle line:84%
from that time period, but he
was also a Babylonian magician.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And although Pythagoras's life
came to an unfortunate end,

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
we have him to thank
for the work of Proclus,

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Euclid's geometry,
or Plato, who gave us

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:84%
the Platonic solids, and all
the great Neoplatonic thinkers,

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:32.670 align:middle line:90%
like Plotinus.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras was
the first one ever

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
to call himself a philosopher,
and we will forever

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.550 align:middle line:84%
remember him as a great master
who shared his enlightenment

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom with the world.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jonny Enoch, and thanks for
