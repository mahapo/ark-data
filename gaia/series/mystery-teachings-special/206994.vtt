00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Johnny Enoch, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:10%
According to esoteric
teachings, survivors

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:10%
of lost ancient
civilizations seeded us

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.750 align:middle line:10%
through the mystery schools
and left behind a trail

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:10%
of symbolic breadcrumbs.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.549 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
will explore the origins

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:84%
of our ancient
progenitors, what happened

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
to them, and their
influence on us today.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Traditionally, there
have been many theories

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
about submerged continents, such
as Hyperborea or Plaksha, which

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
was believed to exist in the
far North of the Arctic Circle.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It was mentioned by
our ancient historians

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
like Herodotus and
Pliny the Elder.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:84%
We're told that they were
a beautiful race of giants

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and used flying machines to
circumnavigate the Earth.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
They inhabited a land free
from disease in old age

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:84%
where the sun would
shine 24 hours a day.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Then there was Mu in
the Pacific Islands,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
where Hawaii in
Vanuatu is today.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.240 align:middle line:84%
But probably the most
famous of these legends

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:90%
comes from Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:10%
The theories about Lemuria
come from a 19th century

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.200 align:middle line:10%
British lawyer and
zoologist, Philip Sclater,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:10%
who was perplexed by
the presence of lemur

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:10%
fossils in Madagascar
and India after none

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:10%
could be found in mainland
Africa or the Middle East.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:10%
In 1864, he wrote
an article entitled,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:10%
"The Mammals of Madagascar,"
where he theorized

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:10%
that Madagascar
and India were once

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:10%
part of a larger submerged
continent in the Indian Ocean

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:10%
called Lemuria.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:10%
And for a while, his theory
was really starting to take off

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:10%
and was adopted everywhere.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
But what's confusing
about this subject

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.280 align:middle line:84%
is that while some people
use the name Lemuria

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
as being synonymous
with Atlantis or Mu,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:84%
it didn't just come
out of nowhere.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:84%
It actually has a very
specific geographically

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:90%
and linguistic connection.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
In my conversations with
JP Hague, a British lawyer

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and researcher
living in Mauritius,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:84%
he tells me that "lemur"
is an ancient Malagasy

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
word from Madagascar meaning
the souls of the departed.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.520 align:middle line:84%
At the turn of the
20th century, it

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
seemed like Sclater's
Lemuria theory was completely

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.650 align:middle line:84%
debunked due to new
sciences emerging

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.180 align:middle line:84%
at the time about continental
drift and plate tectonics.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
However, that didn't
stop Tamil revisionists

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:84%
from adopting the story
into their literature

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:84%
around India, which
they already had

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:84%
a similar pre-existing theory
from around the 2nd century

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:84%
CE that was written in
"The Silappadikaram," one

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
of the five great
Tamil epic stories.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.280 align:middle line:10%
It was about this
ancient place called

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:10%
Kumari Kandam that was ruled
by the Pandiyan kings for 9,990

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:10%
years.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It says in there that the
cruel sea took their land.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.340 align:middle line:84%
The Tamil writers
would also claim

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:84%
that this was the place where
the Brahmins or priests reside,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
were Shiva was worshipped, and
where the Vedas are recited.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria was even mentioned by
the great Russian occultist

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and psychic, Helena
Petrovna Blavatsky.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.030 align:middle line:84%
In "The Secret Doctrine,"
Lemuria was called Shalmali,

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and it was a lush,
beautiful tropical paradise

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:84%
until volcanoes
erupted everywhere,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.030 align:middle line:84%
destroying it and
submerging it underwater.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.100 align:middle line:84%
According to
theosophists, Lemuria

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
began over 34 and 1/2
million years ago.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:84%
It was inhabited by a
hermaphrodite race of giants

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
that were 15 feet
tall, had four arms,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and were coexisting with the
dinosaurs around the middle

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Jurassic period.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
They would later evolve into
various primitive hominid

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.510 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.580 align:middle line:10%
The idea of a
submerged continent

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:10%
is not hard to
imagine if you think

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:10%
of places like Port
Royal in Jamaica,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:10%
just outside of Kingston,
which was once a bustling port

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:10%
city of great importance to
the British empire and home

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.900 align:middle line:10%
to the pirate Sir Henry Morgan.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:10%
2/3 of the town, or 33 acres,
sunk into the sea within hours

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:10%
and disappeared off the map
after an earthquake in 1692.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.200 align:middle line:10%
And there are
countless other places

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:10%
like this, such as
Thonis-Heracleion,

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:10%
just outside of
Alexandria in Egypt,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:10%
or the underwater
temples discovered

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.640 align:middle line:10%
near Okinawa in Japan, and
the submerged pyramids off

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:10%
the west coast of Cuba.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:10%
In recent years,
new interest has

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.120 align:middle line:10%
emerged into Sclater's
Lemuria theory,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.940 align:middle line:10%
and you might even say
he's been vindicated.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:10%
In fact, scientists have
made important discoveries

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:10%
on the island of Mauritius,
claiming that not only does

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.840 align:middle line:10%
this part of the
Indian Ocean have

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:10%
a strong gravitational
pull, indicating a thicker

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.200 align:middle line:10%
crust below, but they
found a strange mineral

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:10%
crystal on its
beaches called zircon

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle line:10%
that's 3 billion years old
and has radioactive particles.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:84%
This has puzzled
geologists since Mauritius

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:90%
is only 8 million years old.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.870 align:middle line:84%
There's also a land bridge
off the northwestern coast

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:84%
of Sri Lanka that
connects to India

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and is made from limestone
shoals or sandbars.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
It's called Rama's
Bridge because of a story

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.200 align:middle line:84%
we get from the Indian epic,
"The Ramayana," when Rama

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
is sent into exile
by his father and has

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to rescue his wife Sita from
Ravana, a 10-headed demon king.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.290 align:middle line:84%
In order to complete
that, he and his brother

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Lakshmana assemble a large
army of ape-like men,

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.380 align:middle line:84%
but they need a way
to cross the water.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
This is when they get
help in its construction

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
from the Vanaras, or
the forest people.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:10%
According to the story, the
bridge was built in five days

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:10%
and was 100 leagues in length.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.590 align:middle line:84%
This structure has also been
called Adam's Bridge, which

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
it's believed in Islam that
this is the place that Adam

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:90%
fell from the Garden of Eden.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:10%
But what's fascinating about
that is that geologists now

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:10%
tell us that these places
are in fact connected

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:10%
and the continent
of Mauritia was part

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:10%
of an enormous
supercontinent called

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.780 align:middle line:10%
Gondwana, which broke up and
became Antarctica, Africa,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:10%
Australia, and South America.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.680 align:middle line:10%
Another interesting
fact is that we

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:10%
know that the sand on
the beach of Australia

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:10%
actually comes from
Antarctica and is hundreds

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:10%
of millions of years old.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:10%
Another strange fact is
that lake Titicaca in Peru

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.840 align:middle line:10%
is over 12,500 feet
above sea level

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:10%
and has fossilized seashells
and seahorses in it.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Not only do we believe it
was once a great seaport,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:84%
but we know that the Andes
are relatively new mountains.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:84%
In other words, someone managed
to get up there fast enough

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:90%
to build walls around the place.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
When I visited those
parts with Brien Foerster,

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I was captivated by the
megalithic structures

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:84%
at Tiwanaku and
Pumapunku in Bolivia,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.910 align:middle line:84%
where we find evidence
for advanced machining

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and magnetic anomalies
around the infamous H blocks.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The whole place is crawling
with subterranean networks.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Even the blocks there
show vitrification

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:84%
from some sort of
extreme heat or scorching

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:90%
by a cataclysmic event.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.380 align:middle line:10%
But what I find most
interesting about Mauritius

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:10%
is that there are these seven
ancient pyramids there aligned

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:10%
with the bodies of Orion,
built from volcanic rock.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Also think about what
Blavatsky tells us

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
with the eruptions of
volcanoes destroying Lemuria.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Nearby, there are connected
islands and strange mountains

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle line:84%
in the shape of a skull and
a lion, or a sphinx shape.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.270 align:middle line:84%
But speaking of
pyramids and sphinxes,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
we cannot leave this subject
without talking about Atlantis.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The location of Atlantis
has been speculated

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:90%
by countless scholars.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
We have the traditional theory
held by Manly P. Hall, Ignatius

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Donnelly, and Blavatsky, who
said that Atlantis was probably

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
located in the middle
of the Atlantic Ridge.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:84%
That's right in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in the
story, we learn

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:84%
about something known as
the pillars of Hercules.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:10%
Well, those could be
the rock of Gibraltar.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we would
see the Azores and Canary

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Islands acting like
their mountain peaks

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:84%
with a slow
migration, coming out

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:84%
while Europe was still under
ice, melting after the last Ice

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Age.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Even Rudolf Steiner, who
used the science called

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:84%
anthroposophy, an earlier
type of remote viewing

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.010 align:middle line:84%
or a psychic
archaeology, to look

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:84%
at what he called
the Atlantean Epoch,

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:84%
claimed that it
existed at a time

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:90%
when Europe was not even around.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Why the Lemuria
story is important

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.260 align:middle line:84%
is that we're told
that Atlantis was

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
an extension of the survivors
of Lemuria in the same way

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:84%
that Egypt was an extension
of the Atlanteans.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
They inherited their rituals,
they inherited their teachings

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
in the very same way
that we are inheriting

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:84%
those of the ancient
civilizations that

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:90%
came before us today.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But if Egypt was an
extension of the Atlanteans,

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:84%
we find similar structures
to theirs all over the world.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, we find pyramids
on both sides of the Atlantic.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
We find pyramids over in
Mexico, with Chichen Itza,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.680 align:middle line:90%
over in Teotihuacan.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
We find them over in
Tikal in Guatemala.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:84%
There's over 140 pyramids
in the Azorean islands,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and some of the largest
pyramids in the world

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:90%
are found in China.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:84%
This was a continental
diffusion of culture.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Where I think people
go wrong in theorizing

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:84%
the location of Atlantis is
they think much too small.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:84%
When we want to imagine where
these great pre-cataclysmic

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.530 align:middle line:84%
civilizations existed we have
to think of the supercontinents.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Or think of Pangaea, where when
we look at a map or an atlas,

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.520 align:middle line:84%
you see it looks like all
the continents fit together

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:90%
like puzzle pieces.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Bible, we
find in Genesis 10:25,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
it says, and to Eber
were born two sons.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:10%
The name of one was
Peleg, for in his days

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:10%
the Earth was divided.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.420 align:middle line:10%
This is literally
telling us that we

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.510 align:middle line:10%
have records of a great
continental diffusion

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.200 align:middle line:10%
of cultures.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:84%
While we know that the original
Atlantis story at the Temple

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Nefru has since washed
away on the Nile Delta,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
we find an exact
copy of that story

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
over at the Temple
of Edfu in Egypt.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.210 align:middle line:84%
When I visited there with
Egyptologist Mohamed Ibrahim,

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.810 align:middle line:84%
he's decoded the entire
story on the wall for me

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.810 align:middle line:84%
as we see these great
seafaring people.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And what's really interesting
about the advanced knowledge

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and culture they brought
with them, on the walls

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
we noticed that there is a great
cataclysmic event portrayed

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
above them with a serpent that
is coming down to destroy them.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And while some authors
and researchers out there,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:84%
like Graham Hancock,
have theorized

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
that this illustration depicts
an asteroid of sorts coming

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:84%
towards the Earth, we
know in the mysteries

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:84%
that the serpent
always represents

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic energy.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I think that what happened
is around 12,000 years ago

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.110 align:middle line:84%
the Atlanteans were
experimenting with this energy

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and gravity using our
Earth's grid of ley lines,

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.380 align:middle line:84%
harnessed by the power
of pyramids and obelisks,

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:84%
causing something that
geologists call the Younger

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Dryas Cataclysm or the
meltwater pulse 1B.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:84%
This melted the polar ice caps,
causing sea levels to rise.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And what we would
have found is there

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
was a shift in the axis of the
Earth by 23 and 1/2 degrees,

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:90%
moving the equatorial lines.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think there could have
been a combination of asteroids

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.453 align:middle line:90%
and solar eruptions.

00:12:04.453 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
This would have caused
a change in the Earth's

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:84%
gravitational fields,
causing a mini Ice Age.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:84%
That means that the North
and South Pole would have

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:90%
been very different places.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.510 align:middle line:84%
As even Immanuel
Velikovsky points out

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:84%
in "Worlds in Collision,"
that we can find

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:84%
flash frozen tropical
flora and fauna and mammals

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.560 align:middle line:90%
in the Arctic.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:84%
When I visited the
ancient temples of Egypt

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
with Brien Foerster,
we've gone to places

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.430 align:middle line:84%
like Luxor and Karnak, and Brien
has used various instruments,

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
like his Tesla
meters, to measure

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:84%
the pre-cataclysmic
entrances to the temples.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And what he's
found is that these

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:45.100 align:middle line:84%
are 23 and 1/2 degrees off
from the cardinal directions

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:90%
of north, east, south, west.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:84%
This proves the theory that
these temples existed at a time

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.610 align:middle line:90%
before the cataclysms.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:84%
At that point, we're told
that the surface of the Earth

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:84%
became unlivable, so
these groups descended

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:84%
into the subterranean
depths of the Earth.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:10%
One author named Valerie Bonwick
has a very interesting series

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:10%
of books, which she claims
to be in telepathic contact

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:10%
with the survivors of
Atlantis called the Dagonites,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.930 align:middle line:10%
and tells us that they have
underwater bases to this day.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:10%
Edgar Cayce, the
Sleeping Prophet,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:10%
tells us that before
the destruction

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.860 align:middle line:10%
of this great continent,
the Atlanteans

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:10%
were scientifically
advanced and had

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:10%
flying machines and submarines.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Could their survivors have
seeded our civilizations

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.500 align:middle line:90%
after the cataclysms?

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:90%
I tend to think so.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:84%
We learn from
Diodorus of Sicily,

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:84%
who wrote in the "Bibliotheca
Historica" in 50 BCE

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:84%
that "the Egyptians were
strangers who, in remote times,

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:84%
settled on the
banks of the Nile,

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.360 align:middle line:84%
bringing with them the
civilization of their mother

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
country, which might have been
Atlantis, the art of writing

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:90%
in a polished language.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:84%
They'd come from the
direction of the setting

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:84%
sun, or the far west, and
were the most ancient of men."

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the
Atlanteans spread out

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:90%
after these cataclysms.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:84%
According to Plutarch,
the gods of ancient Egypt

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:84%
were actually the antediluvian,
or pre-cataclysmic,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:84%
kings who were deified, were
made into gods after death.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle line:84%
This was probably the way
that the dynastic Egyptians

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.350 align:middle line:84%
saw them, as these great
gods or their progenitors,

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.890 align:middle line:90%
the survivors of Atlantis.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps J.R.R. Tolkien's
"Lord of the Rings"

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
wasn't far off when he talked
about the Middle Earth,

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:84%
as we've heard about the
inhabitants of Cappadocia,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Turkey, the tunnels used
by the Templar Knights

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:84%
under Scotland, and
the Tuatha de Danann,

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
or the people of
the goddess of Danu

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:84%
in Ireland, that arrived onto
their shores with flying ships,

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:84%
only later to flee underground
with the arrival of the Fir

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:90%
Bolg, or the Men with Bags.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of you have
heard of the Men with Bags,

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.990 align:middle line:84%
as we find pictures of them
from all over the world.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Some theorize all
kinds of crazy things,

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.993 align:middle line:84%
like maybe they're holding some
kind of psychedelic substance

00:15:04.993 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're handing it
to primitive people out

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:84%
of their bags, or
this is some sort

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:84%
of weapon from the future that
has electromagnetic qualities.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:84%
But the answer is
more mundane, as we

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
find them from the Assyrians,
the Akkadians, the Phoenician

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Canaanites, the
Etruscans, and many people

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:90%
do trip out on them.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But when I wanted to get
the story about them,

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I had to visit
the British Museum

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and talk to the historians
about these depictions

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.530 align:middle line:84%
that we find on the
reliefs or the depictions

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:84%
on the walls at the Assyrian
section of the museum.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Their answer was
very interesting.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.390 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
them directly, you

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:84%
see they're holding
something in their hand.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:84%
I was told that is the
date, or the date palm.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And in their bag, I'm
told that that is pollen.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Why that's very
interesting is that these

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.460 align:middle line:84%
are the ancient
pollinators of humanity.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.640 align:middle line:84%
We know the date palm has
long since been associated

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:84%
in the Middle East with
beekeepers that need

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:90%
a beehive for harvesting honey.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:84%
What's also very interesting
about this symbology

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.130 align:middle line:84%
is that all the early
Egyptian and Babylonian kings

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:90%
were called the Beekeepers.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.990 align:middle line:84%
When Adam Weishaupt
was first starting

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
the Bavarian Illuminati
on May 1, 1776,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.740 align:middle line:84%
he originally wanted to
call them the Beekeepers.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we find
the symbolism is

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:84%
very important to Freemasonry
and our secret societies,

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.720 align:middle line:84%
as the little honeybee
is very industrious

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's associated with
hard work and determination.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:84%
We even find that the coin
of emphasis had a bee on it.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.730 align:middle line:10%
When we examine the
headdress of the nimbus

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:10%
of the Egyptian king,
according to Manly P. Hall's

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:10%
"Secret Teachings of All
Ages," not only does this

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:10%
represent the auric body,
or the energy field,

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:10%
but we might also look at it
as representing the honeybee.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:84%
This is very important
when we consider the fact

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:58.440 align:middle line:84%
that the early Egyptian kings
were all called the Beekeepers,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and this represents their
role as the great pollinators

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.450 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.880 align:middle line:84%
But speaking of
ancient worlds, when

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:84%
we go back to J.R.R.
Tolkien, we know

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
he spent a lot of
time writing at a pub

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:84%
near the cliffs of Moore,
right next to the Gollum caves.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.319 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
the story, Smeagol

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
turns into the Gollum
creature obsessed

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:84%
with a golden ring forged
by dark Lord Sauron

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:84%
in the fires of Mount Doom
as he hissed, my precious.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Do we have anthropological
evidence for such extinct races

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and civilizations?

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:10%
Well, we have to look no further
than a short, ancient hominid

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:10%
race that lived over 17,000
years ago, that are literally

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:10%
called hobbits, or
Homo floresiensis.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:10%
They were discovered on the
Flores Island of Indonesia.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And then there are the legends
of the 4-foot-tall Pygmy people

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.110 align:middle line:84%
who inhabited Greenland and
northern Canada, mentioned

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:84%
in the 16th century by
the geographer Mercator.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:84%
We're told they were wiped out
by large and aggressive birds

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:90%
or cranes.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Manly P. Hall tells us in "The
Secret Teachings of All Ages"

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:11.010 align:middle line:84%
that today's civilization was
inherited from the Atlanteans

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:84%
with our arts and crafts,
philosophies and sciences,

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
ethics and religions, but
also our hate, our strife,

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:90%
and our perversions.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:10%
The Atlanteans instigated the
first war, and all other wars

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:10%
after those were fought
in a fruitless effort

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.760 align:middle line:10%
to justify the first one
and right the wrong which

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:10%
it caused.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Blavatsky tells us in her work,
"Isis Unveiled," that Atlantis

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
became corrupted and
fell under an evil ruler

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.470 align:middle line:90%
of the era, Thevatat.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
This caused the Atlanteans
to become wicked magicians,

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:84%
or maybe we could
say scientists,

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.850 align:middle line:90%
and a war was declared.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:10%
This was created out of
the disfigured allegory

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:10%
of the race of Cain or
giants in the story of Noah.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:10%
If we think about
the famous story

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.030 align:middle line:10%
of Noah's Ark for a
moment, biblical scholars

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.310 align:middle line:10%
maintain that it can be
found on top of Mount

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:10%
Ararat in present day Armenia.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.100 align:middle line:84%
This is very significant when
we think of the story as Noah

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:90%
the Atlantean.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:10%
After all, we're told
that much like the story

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:10%
of the flood in Genesis,
where the water rose up

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:10%
from the Earth, or
the underwater mantle,

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:10%
Atlanta suffered earthquakes
and floods, swallowing it up,

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:10%
as we find a lot of
interesting clues

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.550 align:middle line:10%
when we look up at migration
patterns towards high altitude

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.190 align:middle line:10%
places, like the Ural
Mountains in Eurasia,

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.700 align:middle line:10%
Machu Picchu, or Tibet.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Blavatsky goes on to say,
the conflict came to an end

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.040 align:middle line:84%
by the submersion
of the Atlantis,

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.840 align:middle line:84%
which finds its imitation in
the stories of the Babylonian

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:90%
and Mosaic flood.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.410 align:middle line:84%
The giants and magicians and
all flesh died in every man,

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
all except Xisuthrus and Noah,
who are substantially identical

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
with the great father of the
[NON-ENGLISH] in the "Popol

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Vuh" or the sacred book
of the Guatemalans,

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
which also tells of his
escaping in a large boat,

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:90%
like the Hindu Noah, Vaivasvata.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We know before Atlantis
was submerged underwater,

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:84%
its spiritually illumined
masters and initiates

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:84%
recognized that Atlantis
was on a path of destruction

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and it deviated from the light,
so they established themselves

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, where they became
the first divine rulers.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:84%
These priests brought with them
the sacred and secret doctrine,

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:84%
which is where the
myth of the dying

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.860 align:middle line:84%
God, astrological
sciences, the cross,

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and the serpentine
rulers came from.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Even the colors of
red, white, and blue

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.870 align:middle line:84%
that we find on the American
flag came from Atlantis.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:84%
This is also connected to
Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Nearly all our great
cosmological myths

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
forming the foundation of
the various sacred books

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:56.160 align:middle line:84%
of the world are based upon the
Atlantean mystery traditions.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Another great secret about
how the Atlantis story has

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:02.970 align:middle line:84%
been preserved is that if you go
into the last book of the Bible

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:84%
called Revelation, this is
based on something called

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.640 align:middle line:90%
the Book of the Apocalypse.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask
any good Christian

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
out there, who wrote
the Book of Revelation,

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:84%
they will tell you it
came from John of Patmos.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we know
that John of Patmos

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:84%
is belonging to something called
the Johannine or Johannine

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:84%
theory that attributes
this book to him.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But all the great
church fathers that

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
came along, from Martin
Luther to Erasmus,

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:90%
they all dismissed this.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
They said the Book of Revelation
was not a Christian book,

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and it was tossed out of the
Bible over a dozen times.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:84%
We know that when Christianity
came to take over paganism

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and christianize
the mysteries, this

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:84%
was a way of the pagan
doctrines being preserved.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you go
to any good minister

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and ask them to really decode
what the symbolism in this book

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.500 align:middle line:84%
means, they'll have a
pretty hard time really

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:90%
telling you its origins.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:84%
The reason for that
is that this book

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
comes from these very ancient
monks that lived on that island

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:09.830 align:middle line:84%
called Patmos in this rocky
area of the Aegean Sea.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.210 align:middle line:90%
They served two gods.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.970 align:middle line:84%
One of those god's name
was Attis and the other

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:84%
was Ion, the god of the
air and electricity.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:84%
This is just like,
as Blavatsky said,

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
the Atlanteans were ruled over
by an invisible serpent king

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.170 align:middle line:90%
of the air called Thevatat.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, Ion was this god
that was ruling over them

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and gave them this
book of the apocalypse.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this story, we
find that it is essentially

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:90%
the Atlantis story.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.660 align:middle line:84%
In the Atlantis story,
we have the seven cities.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, in the Book of Revelation,
when it was romanized,

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:10%
we know that there are
seven hills of Rome.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:84%
It's talking about a warning
for an advanced civilization,

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that you don't want to take a
mark to buy, sell, or trade,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and is describing a bee
system, which very much sounds

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:84%
like some sort of
artificial intelligence

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.580 align:middle line:84%
or other sorts of
advanced systems

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:84%
that led to the corruption and
the downfall of the Atlanteans.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But the Atlantis story
doesn't end there,

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:84%
as the mystery schools have
seeded many civilizations,

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:84%
which every time
one is destroyed,

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:84%
another rises from the ashes
like the great Phoenician

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Firebird known as the Phoenix.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.370 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to the
story of Sir Francis

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Bacon in the 16th century.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:10%
Sir Francis Bacon is
known as the father

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.570 align:middle line:10%
of modern Freemasonry.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.090 align:middle line:84%
We know he was
born Francis Tudor

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and he was the bastard
son of Queen Elizabeth.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:84%
According to esoteric
teachings, Francis Bacon

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
was the true identity
of William Shakespeare.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:51.140 align:middle line:10%
This comes from something known
as the Baconian theory, where

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:10%
we're told that there's no
way that Shakespeare, who

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:10%
was a Stratford man who could
barely spell his own name,

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.500 align:middle line:10%
could write these brilliant
incredible books with so

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:10%
many layers of different
analogies and ideas

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:10%
and stories.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And what we're told is that
he was writing these books

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:84%
to prepare the minds of the
civilization for something

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:84%
he called the New Atlantis,
which was the great plot

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to build America from
the Masonic orders

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:90%
and secret societies.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:84%
These great works were a way
of elevating our consciousness

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and bringing us to a point
where we wouldn't make

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.390 align:middle line:90%
the same mistakes as the past.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
In the very same
way, you might say

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:84%
that we are currently evolving
for our next great unfolding

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.590 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:84%
If there's a takeaway from
studying Atlantis, Lemuria,

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and ancient
civilization, we know

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:90%
that they rose to greatness.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:84%
We know at times they
were drunk on ambition

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and had the psychosis
of success, which

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.970 align:middle line:90%
later became their downfall.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.520 align:middle line:84%
As we look to the
future, let us not

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:84%
make the same mistakes as
the past, but grow from all

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
that we have
inherited from them.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:84%
We should ask ourselves, how
can we be of service to others,

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.040 align:middle line:84%
be more kind and
compassionate, and learn to be

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:90%
the caretakers of this planet?

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Let us grow and evolve
together into an even greater

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.160 align:middle line:90%
civilization than ever before.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:21.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm Johnny Enoch, and thanks for
