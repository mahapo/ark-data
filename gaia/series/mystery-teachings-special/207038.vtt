[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Jonny Enoch and this
is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.380 align:middle line:10%
Many of you are familiar with
the concept of past lives

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.820 align:middle line:10%
or transmigration.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.890 align:middle line:10%
Not only is this
taught in branches

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:10%
of our Eastern religions
like Hinduism, Jainism,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:10%
and Buddhism, but
this is no doubt

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:10%
the original meaning of
the Christian teaching

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:10%
of being born again.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.670 align:middle line:84%
The word reincarnation just
means to re-enter the flesh,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and is reinterpreted
from a Sanskrit word

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Samsara that has a much broader
definition about rebirth.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.750 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we'll discuss
how your life, circumstances,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
your family, and
friends are no accident

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and you've done this
before many times.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I want you all to think
back to a time in your life

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:84%
when you have encountered
significant people

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:84%
or circumstances that were
eerily familiar to you

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.400 align:middle line:84%
like when you've
just met someone

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
for the first time at
a line up at a coffee

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:84%
shop in the middle
of nowhere, yet they

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:84%
feel like a best friend
that you've known forever.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's the
total opposite,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and you've had a
complete antipathy

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
for someone
instantly after being

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.615 align:middle line:84%
introduced to them no matter
how nice they might seem.

00:01:25.615 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Many times, we might have a
draw towards certain kinds

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:84%
of traditions, music,
or art from entirely

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.530 align:middle line:84%
different cultures than
what we've grown up with.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.290 align:middle line:84%
These sorts of scenarios
are not uncommon,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.900 align:middle line:84%
as oftentimes we might
find ourselves attracted

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:84%
to certain periods of
history or parts of the world

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.570 align:middle line:84%
we've wanted to travel
to all our lives.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
At other times, we want to avoid
those places all together out

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.055 align:middle line:90%
of some unknown fear.

00:01:54.055 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps one of the
greatest arguments

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that could be made
for reincarnation

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
is the phenomena of savants
and child prodigies.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:84%
These are extraordinarily gifted
mathematicians, musicians,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and artists that possess
noticeable talent

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.835 align:middle line:90%
from an early age.

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And while we can explain
away some of this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
with epigenetics
or genetic memory,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
according to esoteric
teachings, your gifts

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and genius in this
lifetime are the result

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:84%
of a development
over many lifetimes.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
We actually have empirical
proof or scientific data

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:84%
connecting past life memories
to real historical events,

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:84%
such as the thousands of
cases that have been collected

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:84%
by psychologist Dr. Jim Tucker
at the University of Virginia.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Not only did he study the past
life memories of young children

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.310 align:middle line:84%
who can recall incredibly
vivid and detailed memories

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:84%
about their past lives,
but their memories

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.560 align:middle line:84%
are connected to countless
different cultures

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.080 align:middle line:90%
and periods of history.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Usually, these memories begin
to fade out at around 7,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:84%
but extraordinary
evidence has been

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.170 align:middle line:84%
found for the legitimacy of
these claims in children.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:10%
Such as we find in the cases
of James Leininger, who

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.380 align:middle line:10%
from the age of 2, had
verifiable memories of being

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:10%
a World War II pilot some
50 years before he was born.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.200 align:middle line:10%
Or take the case of Ryan Hammons
for instance, who not only came

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:10%
from a devout Baptist family
with no belief in reincarnation

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.590 align:middle line:10%
whatsoever, but
at 4 years of age,

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:10%
he started to have these
vivid recollections

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:10%
of being a Hollywood extra and
talent agent in the 1940s that

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.435 align:middle line:10%
just wanted to go home.

00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Even Pythagoras
taught his disciples

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.080 align:middle line:84%
about the teachings
of metempsychosis

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
or the passing of the soul
after death into another body.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:84%
He believed that it took
about 800 human incarnations

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.680 align:middle line:90%
to evolve ourselves.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Much like Buddha and Confucius,
having spent time in India,

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
he learned about the
noble doctrine of rebirth

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.440 align:middle line:90%
from the Brahmins.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras taught that the
idea about us being incarnated

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:84%
into animals actually relates to
us being born under our animal

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:84%
signs from the Zodiac
as our souls travel here

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:90%
from the stars.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:84%
This is not unlike the belief
of the ancient Chaldeans

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Eleusinian
mysteries, is a reminded

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
of the roof at Hathor's
Temple in Dendera

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
of Egypt where when
you look up, you

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:84%
see beautiful illustrations
of people in boats

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:90%
traveling between the stars.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Heraclitus tells
us that Pythagoras

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
could recall several
of his past lives

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and shared them with
his loyal followers.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
At other times, he helped them
remember their past lives such

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
was the case of one of his
disciples, Milo of Crotone who

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.560 align:middle line:84%
remembered that he had been
the Phrygian King Midas who

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:84%
is forever remembered
by Greek mythology

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:84%
as turning everything
he touched to gold.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps one of the greatest
spiritual discoveries ever made

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:84%
about rebirth came from
Dr. Michael Newton in 1996.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
What's really amazing
about his story

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:84%
is that he was a self-proclaimed
lifelong atheist who

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:84%
had a PhD in
behavioral psychology

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and used clinical hypnotherapy
to treat phobias and childhood

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.230 align:middle line:90%
traumas.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:84%
One day, as fate
would have it, a man

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
comes strolling into
his office complaining

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
about an unexplainable
pain in his side

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:84%
that he had since childhood
that not even his doctors

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.220 align:middle line:90%
could figure out.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.058 align:middle line:84%
Because all the x-rays
were fine and they

00:05:39.058 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
kept telling him
that he needed to go

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:90%
see a psychologist instead.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Newton figured it was
probably just some sort

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
of psychosomatic reaction
to a childhood memory.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:84%
But while doing the
session, he went deeper

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:90%
to the source of the pain.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
He was shocked to
hear his patients say

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.930 align:middle line:84%
that this pain came
from a past life

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:84%
as a British sergeant
in World War I.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Instead of relieving
the pain right away,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Newton, being an
amateur historian buff,

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
asked him for a name, military
unit, and badge number.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:84%
After the client left, he
called the British war office

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
in Imperial Museum
in London to find out

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.030 align:middle line:84%
if this British sergeant
ever actually existed.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, he died
in 1916 and all his details

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:90%
checked out.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Newton soon discovered we
all have incredible memories

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.140 align:middle line:84%
of what it was like to die,
cross over to the spirit side,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:84%
review our lives, and pick
our bodies before we get here.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Newton went on to establish
a highly-respected standard

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:84%
in the field of past
life regression called

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Life Between Lives therapy.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:10%
Thanks to Newton's
thorough questioning

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.990 align:middle line:10%
and detailed mapping out
in the dialogues he's

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.760 align:middle line:10%
had with thousands of
clients over the years,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:10%
we've learned a lot about
the process of reincarnation

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:10%
involving this unique sphere
of our soul we all have

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.365 align:middle line:10%
and where we go between
lives on the spirit side.

00:07:04.365 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:84%
On the spirit side, not only
are we reunited with loved ones.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
We play games over there,
make music, and take part

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle line:90%
in recreational activities.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:84%
We do not have to incarnate
on Earth for more lives

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.780 align:middle line:84%
if we do not wish to come
here and endure the harshness

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.730 align:middle line:90%
or the cruelty of our world.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But for those of us
that choose to return,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:84%
we do so for our own
growth and evolution.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:84%
We can even incarnate on other
planets, dimensions, galaxies,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.680 align:middle line:90%
and solar systems.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Even if your life is
difficult on Earth right now,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.170 align:middle line:84%
you might say, I'm never coming
back to this place again.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.260 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that this is a
very physical perspective.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how hard
it might seem right now,

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:90%
you chose to be here.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
These case studies of
past life regressions

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
have also confirmed much
of what we've learned

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:90%
in our esoteric teachings.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Not only do we have
an immortal soul name,

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:84%
but we are spun out of
various creation suns,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and these exist in
each galaxy, as there

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.590 align:middle line:84%
different types of soul
vehicles for the incarnations

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.128 align:middle line:90%
required there.

00:08:18.128 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:10%
This has been mentioned in books
like "The Afterlife of Billy

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:10%
Fingers" by Dr. Annie Kagan,
and Newton mentions it

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:10%
in "Journey of Souls".

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:84%
But I've also encountered
this in many cases

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
where I've done
regressions with people.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:84%
We tend to operate in a
soul group cluster that

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:84%
has an interconnected evolution,
meaning we are evolving

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:84%
around the same time
as our soul group

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and we have a spirit
family of our own

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that was spun out or formed
at the same time as us

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:90%
when we came from the source.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:84%
This is also where we come
to terms like soul mates

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and twin flames
that are connected

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.585 align:middle line:90%
to us from this process.

00:08:54.585 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Animals and other
life forms do possess

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:84%
individualized
intelligences that

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:84%
exist in a slightly different
sphere than human souls.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:84%
But a powerful
connection remains

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.640 align:middle line:84%
with their human companions
where the personalized energy

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.320 align:middle line:84%
that has been
shared between them

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:90%
continues on after this world.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Our pets do continue
on for periods

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:84%
after this life in
the spirit world

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:84%
where oftentimes
they can be seen

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.270 align:middle line:84%
by psychics for a short
while after they pass.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Or we can encounter
them in the afterlife.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.300 align:middle line:84%
This is further substantiated
in neoplatonic and Buddhist

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.390 align:middle line:84%
doctrines as the Buddhists
were the first to open up

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.560 align:middle line:90%
animal hospitals.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:84%
The difference between human
intelligence and animal

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, however, is that
their spiritual and physical

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:90%
natures are slightly different.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
After all, there are some highly
intelligent animals out there.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:84%
We know apes can solve
complex problems that

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:90%
could baffle a sixth grader.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Squirrels can remember
where they buried thousands

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
of nuts and even
outsmart predators

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.000 align:middle line:90%
with their various calls.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But animals operate off of a
different type of intelligence

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.990 align:middle line:84%
called instinct, and they
have a collective soul

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
or a group spirit that generates
countless physical bodies.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:10%
Whereas humans have evolved
an individualized ego

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:10%
with our souls having separate
mental and emotional bodies.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:10%
According to the esoteric
teachings of Manly P Hall,

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:10%
animals not only experience
emotions differently than us,

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:10%
but also physical
pain as we might

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:10%
have an individualized
experience

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:10%
but their pain is absorbed
back into the collective entity

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:10%
of its species.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:84%
However, this does not prevent
the karmic consequences

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:84%
of abusing or
mistreating animals.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.490 align:middle line:84%
The powerful archetypal forces
of the group spirit of animals

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.090 align:middle line:84%
is why the Native Americans
and other ancient cultures

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:84%
recognize the importance
of animal totems

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.020 align:middle line:90%
in aligning with their energies.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:84%
In Eastern theosophy, we
learn that plant life also has

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:84%
a collective entity and is a
cycle lower than the animal

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.465 align:middle line:84%
kingdom and two cycles
lower than humans.

00:11:10.465 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
After a lower form of
plant life has completed

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:84%
its cycles of evolution,
it might become extinct,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.415 align:middle line:84%
and at that point, it evolves
into something even greater

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:23.215 align:middle line:90%
than before.

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:10%
Eliphas Levi tells us this in
his doctrine of Transcendental

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:10%
Magic part 2 that nothing
perishes in nature.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:10%
Whatsoever has lived goes on
living always under new forms

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.020 align:middle line:10%
but even the interior forms
are not destroyed since they

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:10%
remain in our memory.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Not only were trees
sacred to the druids who

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:84%
recognized their electromagnetic
properties such as the Celts

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
did, even with
their tree alphabet

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:84%
we call the Ohms or Oghaims,
but in science we've

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
looked at what's called
"The Secret Life of Trees",

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.860 align:middle line:84%
as we've learned that
their leaves have

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:84%
a photonic exchange of energy
from transbiotic accumulation

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
of sugars, carbon, and oxygen
that has step down into protein

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:84%
bases and calcium which
are distributed down

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:84%
through the roots of the
tree to help other life

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:90%
forms from miles around.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:84%
The collective intelligence
of these life forms

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
is also true for crystals,
minerals, rocks, and elementals

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.460 align:middle line:84%
which are at the
lowest orders of life

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and do not have
an individual body

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
but also emanate
from a group spirit.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The ancients believe
that each precious stone

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:84%
is the result of the rays
from the sun reflecting

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:90%
the signs of the zodiac.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.120 align:middle line:84%
The diamond is the highest of
these orders in the mineral

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.460 align:middle line:84%
kingdom but certain
plants have connections

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:84%
to these kingdoms such
as the case of grapes

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.870 align:middle line:84%
which we can also find
traces of gold within them

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:90%
if you burn their branches.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.180 align:middle line:84%
This is why you find grapes
on the Pentacle cards

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.990 align:middle line:84%
in the Tarot which is associated
with golden coins or disks,

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
as their fruit is
associated also

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:84%
with the deception of earthly
pleasures and materialism.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:84%
The cycles of life are
waves and emanations

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:84%
from the source continue to
constantly grow and evolve

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.780 align:middle line:84%
in a various collective entities
for every aspect of life,

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.780 align:middle line:84%
not only for our own
incarnated personalities

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:24.230 align:middle line:84%
but for every planet,
race, and nation on Earth.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately growing and
evolving its group's

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
soul until every last
life form is enlightened.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Truly, it is only an
illusion that there

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.700 align:middle line:90%
are different races on Earth.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:84%
As in actuality,
everyone we meet

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.760 align:middle line:84%
is really just another
reflection of ourselves.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Newton tells us this
in "Journey of Souls"

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:84%
that when a planet dies
out, the souls from there

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
will move on to another
one like Earth that

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:90%
is harmonic with them.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not far-fetched to
imagine a scenario like that

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.700 align:middle line:90%
happening on Mars originally.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:84%
As we know, it was originally
able to harbor life

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:90%
until losing its atmosphere.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I would ask you,
what better place

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.210 align:middle line:84%
for its original inhabitants
to go than to Earth

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.125 align:middle line:90%
which is just nearby?

00:14:06.125 --> 00:14:09.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.780 align:middle line:10%
According to "Life
Between Lives" sessions,

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.780 align:middle line:10%
some souls recall being
able to exist in two places

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:10%
at once, like having
themselves split in half.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But unlike animals that
have a group spirit that

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:84%
can regenerate countless
physical bodies,

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:84%
souls with split incarnations
are not generally fully present

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:90%
and might be easily exhausted.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many souls
might feel overwhelmed

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:84%
after incarnating
on Earth and require

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
a resting or
reintegration period

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:84%
after finishing
their lives here.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:84%
For souls, there's
no greater purpose

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:84%
than to evolve to the point
of a creator intelligence

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and be in unification
with the supreme being.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.360 align:middle line:84%
There is also a
life review process

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.245 align:middle line:84%
that we do after every
incarnation, which

00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
I've encountered
with people I've

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.260 align:middle line:84%
worked with over the years,
and it's the same one

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
that NDE survivors go through
in a 360-degree panoramic,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
fully-immersive life
review experience where

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:84%
after it's complete, you discuss
your experiences with what's

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:84%
been known as the
Council of Elders

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:84%
or a Council of Wise Ones
who are these loving, very

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:84%
wise beings that consider
all the actions in your life

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.340 align:middle line:84%
along with your spirit guides
as a means of helping you

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
understand what you've
just gone through

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and how to integrate
the lessons.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
This council is assigned to
us to discuss our life plans,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:84%
exit points, and really go
over the strategies of what

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:84%
will be our greatest learning
points before we get here.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.785 align:middle line:84%
So we can either fix up
what we didn't learn before

00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:43.160 align:middle line:84%
or live a life
that's going to be

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:90%
most suitable for what we need.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Another process outlined
in Newton's work

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
is life selection in
the pre-birth process.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Before you were born here, you
get to pick your opportunities

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and what your life experiences
will be out on these screens

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:84%
through the help of
our council of elders.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, these "Life
Between Lives" sessions

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.640 align:middle line:84%
have also revealed that we go
through somewhat of a dress

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:84%
rehearsal with our family
members and friends

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:90%
before incarnating.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:84%
This involves meeting with
our parents in this world

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.840 align:middle line:84%
even before you're born
and giving ourselves

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:90%
unique challenges.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.740 align:middle line:84%
We learn from "Life
Between Lives" cases

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:84%
that older souls incarnate
less and choose to stay back

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and become spirit guides
and take on other duties

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:90%
in between lives.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And while younger souls
might incarnate more often

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:84%
for faster or
easier assignments,

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:84%
many souls choose not to
come back to Earth at all.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Surprisingly enough,
because time does not

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:84%
exist on the spirit side
and it's non-linear,

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.530 align:middle line:84%
everything is happening
in simultaneity

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and linear reality is only an
illusion created by your mind.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
We learn from the
incarnation process

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.010 align:middle line:84%
that you could choose to
be born into a lifetime

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:08.240 align:middle line:84%
in the distant past, let's
say 2,000 years ago or even

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.660 align:middle line:84%
the future if needed, and
there are infinite numbers

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:84%
of timelines and parallel
universes constantly being

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:84%
created every second for
our progress and development

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:84%
that we are shifting
into constantly.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
This is because on
the spirit side,

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:84%
souls create the
illusion of time

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to prepare for incarnations and
measure periods between lives.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:10%
We learn in "The Afterlife
of Billy Fingers"

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:10%
that we also possess the ability
to go from universe to universe

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:10%
by using doorways, but
this process sometimes

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:10%
involves shedding your current
soul vehicle in a void.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:84%
This vehicle is the sum
total of your embodiments,

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.120 align:middle line:84%
and when you go
through this process,

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.600 align:middle line:84%
you gain a new soul vehicle that
can operate in other universes.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
When we begin to examine
our soul from a broader

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.850 align:middle line:84%
perspective, we begin
to understand our lives

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:90%
at a greater depth.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
A word that gets
thrown around a lot

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.730 align:middle line:84%
is karma, which comes from a
Sanskrit word meaning action.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it is
cause and effect.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:10%
What is also
important is Dharma,

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:10%
which is like an unconscious
accumulation of our good deeds

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:10%
and intentions that steers
us in the right direction.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:84%
One way we can understand
karma and reincarnation

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
is by meditating on the Wheel
of Fortune card in the Tarot.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.870 align:middle line:10%
This is based on
the Buddhist concept

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:10%
of the wheel of life also known
as the wheel of Dharma and law.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.400 align:middle line:84%
We get a good idea about this
process from Hermes or Thoth

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle line:84%
who described the streams
of souls flowing back

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:84%
into the material illusion
from the abode of the dead,

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:84%
meaning that the more
emphasis you put upon material

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:84%
possessions during
an incarnation

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:84%
here with your personality and
appetites, the more difficult

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.400 align:middle line:84%
it is for us to stop and
step down from the wheel.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:10%
The ego, personality,
and the self

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:10%
are a direct byproduct
of our embodiments

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.270 align:middle line:10%
which includes our
gifts and talents

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.140 align:middle line:10%
or your genius which the Greeks
called our personal demon.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:84%
This includes our fears,
friends, or lack thereof,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:90%
happiness, and security.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Only the detached
or enlightened soul

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:84%
can escape from
the net of matter

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.915 align:middle line:84%
to attain immortality or
graduate from this Earth.

00:19:24.915 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:84%
When we examine the story
of the life of Buddha,

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:84%
when his body had become
too weak to support him

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and he was making a transition
from this world into the next,

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.570 align:middle line:84%
various animals
gathered around him

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:90%
and birds sat on his shoulder.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.800 align:middle line:84%
He had a discussion
with his disciples

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.220 align:middle line:84%
about rebirth and the
transitory process.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:84%
He starts to explain
to them that he's

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:84%
lived many lifetimes
where he was not

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:90%
always a virtuous or good man.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And some of these lives, he was
very selfish and made mistakes.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.920 align:middle line:84%
In the culpa lata, he says, :
though I am not an immaculate

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Sambuddha, yet I am being
visited by my troubles.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:84%
My body is subject to pains
owing to the evil deeds

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:90%
of my former births".

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Buddha went on to tell them
that in his past lives,

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.860 align:middle line:84%
he'd killed people,
including his own brother

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.510 align:middle line:90%
for an inheritance.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:84%
He told him of
many lives where he

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:84%
was careless of
others' feelings,

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:84%
destroying reputation, and
causing pain and suffering.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:84%
If you visit Borobudur in
Central Java, Indonesia,

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.970 align:middle line:84%
we find the largest
Buddhist temple

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:84%
in the world in a
pyramidal structure that

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.630 align:middle line:84%
consists of these nine stock
platforms, six square and three

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.710 align:middle line:84%
circular that have these
strange bell-shaped domes.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
On there, we find over 504
Buddhist statues or shrines,

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and 2,672 reliefs
that illustrate

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:84%
the various mythological
lives of the Buddha,

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
including his incarnations
as a turtle that

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:02.070 align:middle line:84%
carried lost sailors to shore,
and an elephant that gave up

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:84%
its tusks for a jealous woman
who according to legends

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:84%
later on became one
of his followers.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
In the Jataka, it says that
in his last incarnation

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
before becoming
the Buddha, he was

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:18.070 align:middle line:84%
King Vessantara, who was
very generous and virtuous

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:90%
during his lifetime.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.660 align:middle line:84%
After he left that life
and returned to the Tushita

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.290 align:middle line:84%
heavens, a place of pure
bliss, peace, perfection,

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:84%
we find about his propala, or
the divine and pure sattva,

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.210 align:middle line:84%
or being of the Buddha that
was waiting for reincarnation.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:84%
It is here that Buddha decided
to come to Earth for one

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
more incarnation to clear
his karma from his past lives

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.370 align:middle line:90%
so he could reach nirvana.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So he did so by coming
to Earth as a prince

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and had a pre-birth life plan
to give up his earthly riches

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:90%
and titles.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And although Buddha never
thought of himself as a God

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:84%
as he has been
venerated to be so,

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:84%
we are told there will be
one more divine incarnation

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
of the Buddha with Maitreya, who
is the large full-figured jolly

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.587 align:middle line:84%
Buddha with the belly that
followers bow before when

00:22:06.587 --> 00:22:07.795 align:middle line:90%
entering the Buddhist temple.

00:22:07.795 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the Buddhist
teachings is that life

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:90%
is a school, not a playground.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
But the game of life
can be a fun type

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:84%
of educational learning so
we shouldn't take ourselves

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.040 align:middle line:90%
too seriously.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And while we're here, we need
to develop a sense of humor

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.870 align:middle line:90%
on the journey.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.710 align:middle line:84%
One thing is for certain,
the school of life

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
can be a very advanced
and difficult class.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So the very fact that
you are here regardless

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.990 align:middle line:84%
of how many mistakes you
think you may have made,

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:84%
means that you are all
highly evolved souls.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And that includes
everyone watching this.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.480 align:middle line:84%
You need to give yourself
a pat on the back.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:84%
We come here with a type
of spiritual amnesia

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and most of us can't
remember our past lives.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.950 align:middle line:84%
This is more of a
protection mechanism

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:84%
if anything, as well we may have
been very kind and good people

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.240 align:middle line:90%
in some lives.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.770 align:middle line:84%
In others, we may
have hurt people,

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:84%
or they might be filled with
great tragedies and loss.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.210 align:middle line:10%
This is not always the case
when being on other planets that

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:10%
are more evolved as regressions
have revealed that there are

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:10%
easier places to incarnate
to where you can fully

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.830 align:middle line:10%
remember who you are.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But we have to see
every life we've lived

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:84%
is a role we played
for our own progress

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:90%
in a great cosmic play.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
is that there are

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
a number of ways that we can
learn to recall our past lives

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and identify the patterns of the
lessons we came here to learn.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.470 align:middle line:84%
One popular way is to do
a past life regression

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.690 align:middle line:90%
through clinical hypnotherapy.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Or you could take a
meditative journey

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:90%
to your Akashic records.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Other powerful ways of
opening up the doors

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.180 align:middle line:84%
to your subconscious
memory include

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:84%
using your imagination such as
creative writing or painting

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:90%
and drawing.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you can try doing
is dousing for your past lives

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:84%
by writing down different time
periods on a piece of paper

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and use a pendulum to dangle
over it and see where it spins.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.890 align:middle line:84%
After you finish
these exercises,

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.710 align:middle line:84%
you might recall various
past lives in your dreams

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
or they might come to you in
the form of a clear cognizant

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:90%
thought.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.250 align:middle line:10%
We have to ask
ourselves this, what

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:21.570 align:middle line:10%
is the purpose of all of
this, this world, our lives,

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.480 align:middle line:10%
these bodies and our
experiences if they do not

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.220 align:middle line:10%
exist for a reason?

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:10%
Much like everything in nature,
our universe has a purpose

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:10%
and it is a machine to
grow and evolve souls.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And because we all
come from the One,

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:84%
we won't stay
individuals forever.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we will
all become whole again

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.860 align:middle line:84%
after all the life forms in our
universe become enlightened,

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:84%
we will become
aware of ourselves

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:84%
as an eternal super
consciousness.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
we will witness

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.920 align:middle line:84%
what the Hindu Upanishads
called the weaving

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
of the golden
thread which ties us

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
all together like beads with
all the various galaxies,

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:84%
solar systems,
planets, and souls.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's then we will
create a new universe

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:84%
with new laws, thoughts,
dimensions, and beings

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.140 align:middle line:84%
doing it all over again
in a beautiful process

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:84%
of infinite growth,
expansion, and evolution.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm Jonny Enoch, and thanks for
watching "Mystery Teachings."
