00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.750 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever been scrolling
through your news feed

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:10%
on social media and ran
into a seemingly benign

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:10%
esoteric symbol, but below it
is an elaborate explanation

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:10%
that it must be evil because
it has a hidden meaning?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Well that's not always
the case as there

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:84%
are numerous meanings to
the various logos, names,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:90%
and colors we use.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And you might interpret
them differently

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:90%
once you know what to look for.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.440 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we will
explore the hidden language

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:84%
of symbolism, why it exists, and
how you can learn to read it.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Every day on the commute
to work most people

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
are used to seeing that
two-tailed green mermaid

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
on the side of a coffee cup,
which is not only a siren that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:84%
lures people in for
caffeine, but it also

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:84%
represents an important
figure from European folklore

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and the serpent mother of
the royal families known

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:90%
as Melusine.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:84%
However she's also the
Egyptian goddess Isis

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.140 align:middle line:90%
and the sign for Pisces.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've noticed
a Mazda car emblem

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.330 align:middle line:84%
when you're in traffic, which
says in their own literature

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:84%
that they are named after the
Persian Zoroastrian God Ahura

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Mazda.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:10%
And they used a symbol for
one of the elemental aspects

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:10%
of human existence, which
is a winged man in a flying

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:10%
disk, Faravahar or
Fravashi in the Avestan.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes esoteric
symbolism is even more shocking

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
when it's found in a story of
a popular iconic comic book

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.060 align:middle line:84%
hero or a movie that you've
seen countless times.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:84%
You might be surprised
to learn that Superman

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
is an encoded story
about an Anunnaki ET

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Savior of humanity from a
Nibiru-like planet called

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Krypton.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Both writer Jerry Siegel
and artist Joe Shuster

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.860 align:middle line:90%
were of Jewish descent.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Superman's name was Kal-El.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:90%
His father was Jor-El.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And the symbol on his chest
was the Hebrew letter lamed

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:84%
which looks like an S and is
connected to the House of El.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.210 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Book of Genesis,

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:84%
the Elohim were gods that
created us in their image.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:84%
But in order to find out why
we have esoteric symbolism,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.400 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to look much
further than our great teachers

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:84%
of the past who became martyrs
for having an idealism that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:90%
was far before their time.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.720 align:middle line:84%
At other times,
there were rebels

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
that burned great
libraries to the ground,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
forcing the mystery
schools of antiquity

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:84%
to hide sacred knowledge behind
a cloaked veil of allegories

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:90%
and symbols.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Any knowledge that was intended
for the public or the profane

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
was considered
exoteric knowledge.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Countless civilizations
have come before us,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.910 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of their
writings were lost

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:90%
to great wars and cataclysms.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
But they left behind a
language of symbolism preserved

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and passed down by
the mystery schools.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
This symbolism is
powerful due to how

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:84%
the collective
consciousness of humanity

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:90%
responds strongly to it.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's a hidden
language all around us.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Take our statues for example.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient world
when people were

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
bowing before gods
and goddesses,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
leaving offerings, prayers,
to marble sculptures,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
the wise would stand back
and observe hidden knowledge

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
personified into stone
about celestial mechanics

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:90%
and solar pageantry.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.700 align:middle line:84%
We even find that
today with the Statue

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:84%
of St. Peter at St. Peter's
Basilica at the Vatican

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.350 align:middle line:84%
where people have kissed
the feet off of it.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
Catholic Encyclopedia,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
it's actually Zeus or Jupiter
the ruler of Cassiopeia.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Members of secret
societies are taught

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
to leave behind signs
and tokens in their work.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.920 align:middle line:84%
This could be the reason
why your Gmail logo looks

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
like a Masonic apron
and App Store icon

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:90%
is a compass and a square.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Traditionally in order to
decode any of these symbols,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
you're required to have
a classical education

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:84%
of the seven liberal
arts and sciences.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.480 align:middle line:84%
This would include things
like grammar, rhetoric, logic,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.930 align:middle line:84%
arithmetic, geometry,
music, and astronomy.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we use
esoteric symbols,

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:90%
and we're not aware of it.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
For example many alphabets
have hidden meanings

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:84%
behind their letters,
including our own, which

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
we inherit from the Phoenicians,
or the Hebrew and Arabic.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian hieroglyphics
are a great symbolic alphabet

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
which can be read in
multiple ways or directions

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
depending on the way the
characters are facing you.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, we have
a long writing style

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
that you see on temple walls,
a shorthand version which

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:84%
is much like how we will
have a cursive writing

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and then we have
printed writing.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And then there is a
mystical way of reading

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:84%
the letters that was reserved
for only the initiates.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
When we examine esoteric
and exoteric languages,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:84%
there were two ways
of writing them.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
One way was from left to
right, which was exoteric

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:84%
or publicly known knowledge
because you're writing it away

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:90%
from the heart.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
If you write anything from right
to left, towards the heart,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
these were the secrets
of the ancient world.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:10%
If you look at Jerusalem from
the center of its land mass

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:10%
from space, it's divided
up with all the languages

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.650 align:middle line:10%
to the West being
written left to right

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:10%
and all the languages in the
East are written right to left.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
According to Madam
Blavatsky, the mysteries--

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:84%
like when you're reading ancient
scriptures and mythologies--

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:84%
are like a lock that has
to be turned seven times

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:90%
to decode them.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Here are the seven
keys according to her.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
We have a physiological
or anthropological key,

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:84%
which we'd also call the human
key or being biographical.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.880 align:middle line:84%
When we turn the lock again, we
would have an astronomical key,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.080 align:middle line:84%
meaning that we would have
astrotheological aspects

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:90%
encoded into a story.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:90%
We'd have a symbolic key.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.590 align:middle line:84%
We'll have a
theogonic key, meaning

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:90%
a certain religious tie-in.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:10%
We would have a
meteorological key,

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.780 align:middle line:10%
which we would also connect
to numerical or geometrical

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:10%
values.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:90%
We also had a metaphysical key.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And finally there
was a mystical key.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.390 align:middle line:84%
She also mentioned a combination
of a cosmogeological key

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and even a general
scientific key

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:84%
that was called
the key of matter.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
We see this in the Bible as
it is an encoded document that

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
borrows from the ancient
Egyptians, the Hindu

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:84%
scriptures, Jainism,
and Buddhism.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.120 align:middle line:84%
It's filled with
many secrets that

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:84%
were hidden in its symbolism
by the mystery schools

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:84%
with much of the actual
hidden in the literal.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:84%
First of all, one secret is that
the New Testament is actually

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.240 align:middle line:84%
older than the Old
Testament and they both

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.410 align:middle line:84%
contain hidden astrotheological
stories about not only

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:84%
the procession of the
equinoxes or ages,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:84%
but also the solar mysteries
with Jesus, the son, and his 12

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:84%
helpers are constellations with
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:90%
being the four seasons.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's examine the first
book of the Bible, Genesis.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:84%
We know that it comes from
the Sumerian Enuma Elish.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:10%
And according to some
scholars, they now

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:10%
believe the story
of Abraham and Sarah

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:10%
is in reference to the
Indian Brahman or Brahma.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:10%
And Sarah is a Sarasvati
River mentioned in the Vedas.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.040 align:middle line:84%
We find occult
anatomy is encoded

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:84%
into the story of Cain
and Abel with the two

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
lobes of the cerebrum
were also called

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Cain and Abel by the ancients.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
The legend of the curse of
Cain is the curse of unbalance.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And for the murder of the
spirit or the equilibrium--

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:90%
which is our balance--

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Cain is sent forth as a wanderer
upon the face of the earth.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've watched
Disney's "Snow White

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:90%
in the Seven Dwarves" before.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:10%
This is a symbolic
story about how

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:10%
it says Israel was white
as snow, meaning purity,

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:10%
with its name coming from the
Egyptian Isis, Ra, and El.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:10%
And the seven dwarves
are the personalities

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:10%
of the seven churches of Asia.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:84%
On my trips to the
Vatican, I always

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
notice a famous statue in the
courtyard of the Fontana della

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Pigna or the Fountain
of the Pinecone, which

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:84%
is just outside of the
Egyptian wing of their museum.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:10%
What's very
interesting about this

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:10%
is that on either side of
it, we find two peacocks

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:10%
which represent
immortality, especially

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.580 align:middle line:10%
in relation to the
Indian mysteries.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And just behind it, we find
an open Egyptian sarcophagi

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
telling us that this is the
passageway to everlasting life.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:84%
In this connection to opening up
to regeneration in immortality,

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing that
this is symbolic

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual doorway
to the brain, which

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.870 align:middle line:90%
is the pineal gland.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
This is often symbolized in
the mysteries as a pinecone.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Pontiff
even has a pinecone

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:90%
at the end of his staff.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus mentions
it in the Bible.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:84%
When we look at Matthew 6:22,
he says, "The light of the body

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.030 align:middle line:90%
is the eye.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
If therefore thine
eye be single,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:84%
thy whole body shall
be full of light."

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most
common symbolism

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.850 align:middle line:84%
we find all throughout the
mysteries is the serpent.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.610 align:middle line:84%
It is found all over
the world and represents

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:90%
different types of energy.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.840 align:middle line:84%
We find it in Asia
with the Naga,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:84%
in Mexico with
Quetzalcoatl and Kukulkan

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, we find
it on the headdress

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.910 align:middle line:84%
of the king protruding
from the pineal gland.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:10%
It's on the caduceus
or the medical symbol

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:10%
we use today on the side
of your ambulance showing

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.480 align:middle line:10%
the serpents moving up the
spine and awakening the pineal

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:10%
and the two swan
wings on either side,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:10%
or the hemispheres of your brain
representing the equilibrium.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The serpent is among
the oldest worship

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:90%
symbols venerated in the world.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Anthropologists have even
found caves in Africa

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.590 align:middle line:84%
that portrays serpent worship
going back 70,000 years.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
What we believe
is this tradition

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:84%
comes from Atlantis,
as according

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:84%
to the Arab geographers, the
mythical island was often

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:26.730 align:middle line:84%
referred to as Antilia
Island or the Dragon's Isle.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:84%
The serpent is symbolized as the
awakening of the spirit fire,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
immortality, and
regeneration within us.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:10%
It is also represented
on the cartouche

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.850 align:middle line:10%
of the Egyptian
royalty or name titles.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
When it is facing inwards,
it means the initiate

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
is seeking immortality.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But if the serpents are
facing away from each other,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:84%
it means immortality
has been attained.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:10%
The alchemists, inspired
by ancient Egypt,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:10%
Greece, and the Gnostics,
often used the symbol

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:10%
of the ouroboros or the
serpent eating its own tail,

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:10%
to symbolize
immortality and wisdom.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.160 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of
Genesis, Adam and Eve

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:84%
eat from the tree of knowledge
after conversing with a talking

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
snake that moves up
a tree, or the spine,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.130 align:middle line:84%
as portrayed in
the Sistine Chapel

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.760 align:middle line:90%
by the master, Michelangelo.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
According to Blavatsky,
she says this

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
is based on the tree
rights of ancient India

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
which is where we
get the tradition

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.570 align:middle line:84%
of the Kabbalistic tree of
life and the Jewish candelabrum

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.760 align:middle line:84%
or menorah with
its tree branches

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:84%
holding candles that
represent the planetary bodies

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system and
the chakras on the menorah.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.500 align:middle line:10%
Later in the Book of
Genesis in chapter 49:17,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:10%
it mentions how the
tribe of Dan moved along

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.440 align:middle line:10%
the path of the serpent, or
the ley lines of the earth,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:10%
which is why our ancient
temples have been built

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:10%
with geomagnetic energy
and how the adder was

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.730 align:middle line:10%
biting at their feet.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:10%
The serpent can be
geomagnetic and move along

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:10%
the ley lines of the earth.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Or it can be a type of universal
or invisible energy from which

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:84%
the ancients called Fohat,
and which Tesla called scalar,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:84%
the German secret
societies called Vril.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.470 align:middle line:90%
And today we call it zero-point.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Blavatsky tells us in
the secret doctrine

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
that the ancients
understood that our universe

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and solar system was formed with
serpentine movements, a Fohat,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:90%
using the debris in space.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we know in our sciences
that this is how it works.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Take the formation of
rocky planets for instance.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:84%
We're told that an
embryonic mass gathers

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:90%
from the plaza of stars.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
pushing and a pulling

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
from centripetal and
centrifugal forces.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And because of a heating and
cooling with radioactive decay,

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
we have the gathering
of moisture.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
This is not only what
causes the formation

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.580 align:middle line:84%
of these subterranean
complexes that

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.340 align:middle line:84%
are like a honeycomb
pattern, but this is also

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.530 align:middle line:84%
where the underwater
mantle comes from.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it's amazing
that Blavatsky

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and the esoteric teachings
have said this all along

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:84%
with these serpentine
movements in the universe.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Colors also hold special meaning
in esoteric teachings, not only

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
the ones that we can see, but
also the invisible ones outside

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:90%
of the visible light spectrum.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
To the secret societies,
the colors red, blue, green,

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and yellow were very important,
because these are the hidden

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:90%
prismatic colors of the sun.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.090 align:middle line:84%
We not only find the
symbolism on the Golden Dawn's

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.430 align:middle line:84%
rosy cross, but
the symbol is also

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:84%
found on the Eastern
Star of Freemasonry.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Some colors have been
important to alchemy,

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:84%
with gold and silver being
like the sun and the moon.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.130 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
the rainbow colors

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:84%
which are also associated
with the chakras and auras.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:84%
When we associate them
with a constellation,

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
we typically put their
formation in a wheel.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Not only are color
frequencies associated

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:84%
with musical notes and
the music of the spheres,

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:84%
but when they're represented
in a rainbow pattern,

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.810 align:middle line:84%
they can symbolize a
Kundalini awakening

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
as the energy sources
of the body are lit up.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Another area we need to
examine with esoteric symbolism

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:13.360 align:middle line:84%
is architectonics and the
unique and interesting design

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.330 align:middle line:90%
of occult cities.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.240 align:middle line:10%
The principal for this
comes from Plotinus

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:10%
who wrote an essay called
"The Beautiful," where

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.440 align:middle line:10%
he said that we find this beauty
in all things through symmetry.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:10%
And the importance of aesthetics
was that the more beautiful

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.430 align:middle line:10%
your buildings were, the more
heightened of a consciousness

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:10%
a civilization would have.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
In comparison to today
where a lot of our buildings

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:43.190 align:middle line:84%
are these square, block,
stone, cold-like places.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:84%
We also find an
example of what's

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
known as the triptych arch
inside of government buildings.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you
would see a doorway that

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:90%
has three layers.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Again inside of there,
we find the solar trinity

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of the morning sun, the
midday sun, the evening sun.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Or you go back into the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:08.350 align:middle line:84%
mind, body, and spirit, Brahma,
Shiva, Vishnu, Osiris, Isis,

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:90%
and Horus.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:84%
We also find these
occult secrets

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:84%
encoded into cities like
London, which the Romans called

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Londinium, or the
ancient name Lugh Danann,

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:90%
named after the Celtic sun god.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
It should be noted that if
you ever visit Westminster,

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that there is a
very important obelisk there

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:90%
which comes from Egypt.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was raised in an area
called On or Heliopolis.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the city of the light.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.350 align:middle line:90%
It's very important to masonry.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:10%
And so by placing
that obelisk there,

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:10%
and in other important cities
such as New York, France, as

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:10%
well as just outside
of the Vatican,

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:10%
this symbolism tells us that
the light of the mysteries

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:10%
is there.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But this symbolic link to
obelisk doesn't end there.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:84%
As we also know
that Big Ben, which

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:84%
is built on the
Benben stone, is also

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:84%
in the formation
of a giant obelisk.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:84%
The same is true when we
look at Paris or Par-Isis,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.440 align:middle line:90%
the city of lights.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:84%
When you examine
the Eiffel Tower,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
we know that Mr Eiffel
spent time in Egypt.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And he based the Eiffel
Tower on an obelisk.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
That city is literally loaded
with esoteric symbolism.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But when we look
at these obelisks,

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.870 align:middle line:84%
we find them all over
the world in front

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
of important
governmental buildings

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:84%
or even in Washington DC
with the Washington Monument.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And why that is that
these act like acupuncture

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
needles on the planet to
realign energy that we are all

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.040 align:middle line:90%
receiving on some level.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.960 align:middle line:10%
But churches and
temples are filled

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:10%
with beautiful
historicity and symbolism.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:10%
Especially if we look at
the work of Jay Weidner

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:10%
and Vincent Bridges'
classic book "The Mysteries

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Cross
of Hendaye" where

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:10%
they go into fantastic
detail about the observations

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:10%
made by the
alchemist Fulcanelli,

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:10%
who decoded the
Gothic art hidden

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:10%
in European cathedrals, which
included kabbalistic meanings,

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:10%
cycles, and transformation.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.589 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever looked at
the outside of a church,

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.810 align:middle line:84%
you will notice these
giant steeples which

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.180 align:middle line:84%
are shaped like
phalluses, and the windows

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:90%
look like yoni openings.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Sexual symbolism is
found all throughout

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:84%
our ancient religions,
because it represents

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:90%
God's procreative power.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And this was very sacred
to the mystery schools.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:10%
When you go inside of the church
and move closer to the altar,

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.530 align:middle line:10%
you move closer
to the womb, which

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:10%
is where the preacher stands.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
The yoni and phallus
were worshipped

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:84%
all throughout the ancient
world and were never

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:90%
meant to be anything vulgar.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:84%
On my visits to the ancient
archeological Island

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.990 align:middle line:84%
of Delos near Mykonos
in Greece, you still

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:84%
find evidence of the ancient
phallus worshipping cults.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:90%
We find symbolism for the yoni.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:10%
If you look carefully
at the depictions

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:10%
of Saint Mary on her veils
or the gate of the temple,

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.770 align:middle line:10%
the oval nimbus and
the vesica pisces,

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:06.070 align:middle line:10%
which you might recognize
as a symbol for Mastercard

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:10%
with circles superimposed
on each other.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
carefully, you'll

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:84%
see that the opening for
the yoni is in the middle.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.460 align:middle line:84%
In the 16th century, there was a
famous occultist and astrologer

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:90%
named John Dee.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:10%
He was the original James
Bond or Double 007 for Queen

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:10%
Elizabeth I. This is actually
where Ian Fleming got the idea

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:10%
for his beloved spy character.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Double 007 is not only zero
zero squared with the two eyes

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:84%
for the queen, but it represents
Tubal-cain or two balls

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:90%
and a cane.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a symbol for
procreative power

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and can be seen when you
look above at an illustration

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:90%
for Solomon's temple.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:84%
This symbol is also
important in Freemasonry.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And curiously enough, it looks
just like the Facebook logo.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.610 align:middle line:84%
We also find these symbols
on the American $1 bill.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:10%
As Jordan Maxwell
has been pointing out

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.320 align:middle line:10%
for years in his lectures,
there's a lot more

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:10%
going on the outside
of the American $1 bill

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:10%
as it contains the original seal
for the Bavarian Illuminati,

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:10%
which was founded by Adam
Weishaupt on May 1, 1776.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:84%
As well in one
corner of the bill,

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.120 align:middle line:84%
you can almost
microscopically that there is

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:90%
the Owl of Minerva or Athena.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:10%
But as he'll point out to
you that if you examine

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:10%
the area where
the pyramid is, we

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:10%
see that there is a circle
around the pyramid showing us

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:10%
that the builders of the
Great Pyramid and Stonehenge

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.330 align:middle line:10%
were connected.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.220 align:middle line:10%
We also find the coronas of
the rays of the sun blazing

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.200 align:middle line:10%
in glory around the circle.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.840 align:middle line:84%
As strange as this
may appear, we also

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
find this connection is true
of the symbolism traditionally

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.360 align:middle line:90%
used on American restrooms.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:84%
You might find
that the men's room

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.030 align:middle line:84%
had a triangle or a
pyramid representing

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
this procreative
energy of life, just

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.240 align:middle line:84%
like the word for
"pyramid" is the prya-mid

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:90%
or the fire in the middle.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And the women's
restroom was a circle

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.560 align:middle line:84%
for the circle of
life or the womb.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:84%
There are many
important connections

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
to occult symbols of
numerology and patterns

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:90%
in esoteric teachings.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Some of these come from a
knowledge of Pythagorean number

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.850 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.070 align:middle line:84%
The secret societies
also like to use ciphers.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So you would have an
alphanumeric system,

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:90%
like the letter A is one.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.310 align:middle line:90%
B is two.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:90%
C is three.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So for example, 13 13
is M M for Master Mason.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
astrotheological numbers

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:90%
that stand out.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Like how Enoch lived
to be 365 years of age,

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.280 align:middle line:84%
which is a personification for
the days or cycles of the sun.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:84%
We find that the number of
72 is also very significant

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:54.140 align:middle line:84%
as there is a shifting of
degrees in astrological cycles.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.260 align:middle line:84%
This is found over and
over again in the mysteries

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:84%
with the 72 virgins or 72
like the Greek Septuagint

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Bible where we are
told that there are

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:90%
72 scholars that translated it.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.010 align:middle line:84%
In numerology, we have a
basic foundation of numbers.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:14.570 align:middle line:10%
Number one means new beginnings,
creativity, and willpower.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:10%
Number two is partnerships,
trust choices, and balance.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:10%
Number three always means
mastery, completion,

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:10%
or advancements.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Remember also we
said that this is

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:84%
connected to the Trinity
or mind, body, and spirit.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:10%
Number four represents
hard work, achievement,

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.920 align:middle line:10%
and stability.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.010 align:middle line:10%
Number five represents
adventure, passion,

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.300 align:middle line:10%
and exploration.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:10%
Number six is typically
associated with growth,

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.670 align:middle line:10%
learning, and protection.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:10%
Number seven universally
represents spirituality,

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:10%
mysticism, and healing.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:10%
Number eight is associated
with new opportunities,

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:10%
good fortune, and abundance.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:10%
Nine is the number of
initiation or the months

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:10%
you spend in the womb.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Number 10 was always sacred to
Pythagoras as a perfect number.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.720 align:middle line:10%
Not only because
the symbol for it

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:10%
is the X, which is
like a cross, but it

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.630 align:middle line:10%
was meant to symbolize the
attainment of greatness.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:84%
It is also the number
of nodes that we

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:22.590 align:middle line:84%
find with the sephiroth on
the Kabbalistic tree of life.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
One really cool secret is
that after you understand

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:84%
the universal
symbolism of numbers,

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:90%
you can learn to read the Tarot.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Tarot cards are a great system
that use esoteric symbolism.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Their uses were not always
for divination however,

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:84%
but they also have
meditation purposes.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And traditionally they were used
for sending secret messages.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier to understand
the esoteric keys to the cards

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:48.510 align:middle line:84%
with the numbers in suits so
that you can ask the cards what

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.010 align:middle line:90%
they mean to you.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:84%
These are the esoteric keys
to decoding the symbolism used

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:90%
for the suits in the Tarot.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:84%
When you take pentacles,
for an instance,

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:84%
think of them like money
because we see little coins

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:90%
with pentacles drawn on them.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.800 align:middle line:84%
When you look at their
astrological signs

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:84%
they're associated with, these
are Earth signs, like Taurus,

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Virgo, Capricorn.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So it has to do with issues
involving money, wealth, power.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when we look at what
time frames are associated

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:84%
with this suit of the Tarot,
what you would look at

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.530 align:middle line:84%
is the season of
autumn or years.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you pulled
a two of pentacles card,

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.270 align:middle line:90%
this would represent two years.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.350 align:middle line:84%
When we look at wands, think
of these like creativity,

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and fire, and putting out
energy into the world.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.230 align:middle line:84%
These are associated with
clubs in regular playing cards.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:84%
We know their
astrological principles

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:46.440 align:middle line:84%
are fire signs, like Aries,
Leo, and Sagittarius.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.150 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking
at their meaning,

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.500 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at creativity,
passion, or taking action.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:10%
The time frames
associated with this suit

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.830 align:middle line:10%
would be weeks or
the season of spring.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.380 align:middle line:10%
When we examine swords,
we find that they

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.990 align:middle line:10%
have an intellectual or
mental association with them,

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:09.060 align:middle line:10%
which you can memorize by using
an association with the saying,

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:10%
"she was sharp as a sword".

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:84%
The equivalent in playing
cards is actually spades.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:84%
There's an astrological
association

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:84%
here with air signs with
Aquarius, Libra, and Gemini.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Again these are matters
of intellect, thoughts,

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.350 align:middle line:90%
and observation.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.020 align:middle line:84%
The time frames associated
with these suits

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:84%
are months or the
season of winter.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.910 align:middle line:84%
When we look at cups, these
are matters of the heart,

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:90%
of emotions.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Think of drinking
in, taking things in.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.050 align:middle line:84%
The equivalent with
playing cards are hearts.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:84%
The astrological
association with these

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:84%
are water signs, such as
Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:54.090 align:middle line:84%
The time frames are days of the
week or the season of summer.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Once you master
reading the suits,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:84%
you can apply the knowledge of
esoteric numerology to them.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.890 align:middle line:10%
For example, if you get a one
or an ace of a suit like swords,

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:10%
this is a new
beginning involving

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.270 align:middle line:10%
an intellectual matter,
such as a new job.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.240 align:middle line:84%
If you get a two of cups,
this is a new partnership

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:84%
or relationship involving
an emotional connection.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a cool trick you can use
to read the major arcana also.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:84%
This is just the story of
the trials and tribulations

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:90%
of human life.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.920 align:middle line:10%
The first card is 0
or the fool, which

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.890 align:middle line:10%
is why we call this the
journey of the fool.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:10%
A little secret is the same
man on the magician card of 1

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:10%
and the same woman on the
high priestess card of 2

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.180 align:middle line:10%
are the characters that follow
you through the entire journey,

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.250 align:middle line:10%
all the way up to card 21.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:10%
But the 21 is the 1
and 2 coming together

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.390 align:middle line:10%
of card one and two of both
the masculine and feminine,

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.360 align:middle line:10%
in perfect balance for
the androgynous nature

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:10%
of the universal spirit.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Using this
understanding, you can

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:84%
try doing your own Tarot
spread by asking a question

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what cards
come out of your deck

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.240 align:middle line:84%
or split them into three
cards of one, two, and three

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.900 align:middle line:90%
for past, present, and future.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Symbols are the hidden
or esoteric foundations

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:90%
of cultures around the world.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do throughout
life, whether we know it

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.130 align:middle line:84%
or not, is based and organized
upon cultural and esoteric

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:90%
symbolism.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.910 align:middle line:84%
If there's one thing that
the mystery schools teach us,

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
it's to always seek
the deeper meanings

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and explore
universal truths that

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.710 align:middle line:84%
lay hidden below the
surface level thinking mind.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:84%
