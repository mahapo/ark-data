00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Johnny Enoch and
this is Mystery Teachings.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:10%
In the ancient world, there
were many strange and wonderful

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:10%
secrets lost to us today.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:10%
One of those was an
alchemical technology

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:10%
of lamps that could burn
continuously without ever

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:10%
being extinguished.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:84%
They were mentioned by
over 170 medieval writers

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.680 align:middle line:84%
which we'll discuss many of
them later in this episode.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:10%
When they were discovered,
they were found still

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:10%
burning in sealed tombs from
more than 2,000 years in places

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.430 align:middle line:10%
like India, Tibet,
China, South America,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:10%
and all around
the Mediterranean.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:84%
According to
eyewitness accounts,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
all throughout
history, these lamps

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
were encased in
a circular vessel

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:84%
without ever needing
to be refueled.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And much like the story
of Aladdin's lamp,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:84%
they were believed to
be the product of magic

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:84%
except they didn't contain
a genie inside that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:90%
could grant you three wishes.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the numerous stories
that we hear about them

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
are so mysterious that
many believe they were

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.890 align:middle line:90%
powered by supernatural forces.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:10%
A good example of this
was around 1540 in Rome

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:10%
during the time of
the papacy of Paul III

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:10%
when officials discovered one of
these strange lamps still going

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:10%
strong after 1,600 years inside
of a hermetically-sealed tomb

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.180 align:middle line:10%
on the Appian Way.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.040 align:middle line:10%
According to written
accounts, what

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:10%
is even more eerie than the
perpetually burning lamp within

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:10%
is they found a
perfectly preserved body

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:10%
of a beautiful
young woman floating

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:10%
inside a strange
transparent oil.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
We're told she was
preserved so well

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:84%
it looked as if she had
died just a few hours prior.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:84%
According to the inscriptions
next to the tomb,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:84%
the woman inside was none
other than the daughter

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:90%
of Cicero, Tullia.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
One common theme we
find over and over again

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:84%
is that of ever burning
lamps found in tombs.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:84%
We know it was a common
practice in ancient times

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
to leave a light
near a burial place

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
even for a short while to
brighten up the surroundings

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:90%
or act as an offering to Pluto.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:84%
However, they didn't always
need to use candles or lamps,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
as there are many
natural luminescent

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:84%
sources which early Latin
writers called illuminants.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, there was the
exposure of phosphorus to air,

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:84%
glow worms, and
substances like camphor

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.510 align:middle line:84%
which can burn while
floating on water.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:84%
But did the ancients use
these ever-burning lamps

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:84%
in tombs as spirit beacons
to guide souls back

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:90%
to the afterlife?

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps like Jack o' lanterns
to ward off evil spirits?

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Kircher, the German
Jesuit scholar,

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:84%
wrote in the 17th
century that travelers

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:84%
to Egypt during his day
found ever-burning lamps

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:90%
around the tombs of Memphis.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Greek historians like
Herodotus mentioned

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient Egyptians
would use these lamps

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:84%
in religious festivals and rites
as the priests imagined life

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.480 align:middle line:84%
being like a flame, as our
lives are in perpetual motion.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
This has always
made me appreciate

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful letters we find
an ancient spiritual languages

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
like the Hebrew and
Arabic alphabets

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
where the letters look
like mystical flames.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I've reminded of the
Hebrew letter shin,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
this holds significance
to the Kabbalah

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:84%
as the letter symbolizes the
perpetual fire of spirit that

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.740 align:middle line:84%
burns within us all, and
fuels the ever burning

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:90%
flames of life.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And what I think is
fascinating about that

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
is there seems to be a pattern
with ever burning lamps being

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:84%
associated with sacred places,
religious rights, and initiates

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:90%
of the mystery schools.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:10%
Plutarch mentions in his great
work, De Defectu Oraculorum,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.350 align:middle line:10%
that ever burning laps
were found in ancient Egypt

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:10%
claiming they were
witness blazing eternally

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.660 align:middle line:10%
above the doors to the
Temple of Jupiter Ammon

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:10%
and that King Mycerinus
had many mysterious ones.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:10%
According to the
priests of his day,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:10%
the lamps burned in open air.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be put out by the
elements or by regular means

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:84%
of blowing on them or
dousing them in water.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:84%
When we examine the case
for another lamp discovered

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
in 1404 close to
Rome on the Tiber,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
it was inside the tomb for
Pallas, the son of Evander.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:84%
We're told he was killed
in battle with the building

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:90%
of the eternal city.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:84%
According to witnesses, the lamp
was still burning 2,000 years

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:90%
after his burial in 140 CE.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're told the
only way it could

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:84%
be extinguished is for the
mysterious liquid inside

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:90%
to be drained out.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:10%
In Irish lore, there's a story
about a perpetual flame that

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:10%
was encountered inside of a
mysterious temple at Kildare,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:10%
a place sacred to the goddess
Brigid, the daughter of fire.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.050 align:middle line:84%
We learn from
Possidius and Atticus

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that the lamps were
lit at the temple

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.740 align:middle line:90%
of Minerva Polias in Athens.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
He tells us it was here
that a lamp made of gold

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:84%
could be found burning
for years built

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:90%
by a scholar named Callimachus.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
We find a similar story
of sacred lamps venerated

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
at the Cyrene Temple of Apollo
and the Temple of Aderbain

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:90%
in Armenia.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:84%
This should come of
no surprise to anyone

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
as the Armenians were connected
to the ancient Persians who

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:84%
alongside the
Chaldeans were known

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:84%
to possess ever-burning
fires in their temples.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Of course, many of
these perpetual flames

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
could be explained away
as natural gas leaks,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.310 align:middle line:84%
such as the ones we find
around the temples built

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:84%
into the caverns of mountains
of Turkey, Java, and Nepal.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
To the ancient peoples,
it was no doubt

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:84%
a great sign from the gods about
an important and sacred place

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
to find fire coming
up from the Earth.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
examples of this

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.230 align:middle line:84%
are the mesmerizing blue flames
that came up from the rocks

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and burned continuously for
thousands of years at the Holy

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Hindu shrine at
Jwalamukhi located

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:84%
in the Northern Indian
state of Himachal, Pradesh.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:84%
But not all of
these ancient flames

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
could be explained
away so easily as just

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.110 align:middle line:90%
naturally occurring phenomena.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
The source of power for
the ever-burning fires

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
has mystified our
ancestors for a long time.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:10%
But unlike the secrets of
the Venusian glass-makers

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.900 align:middle line:10%
that gave us the mirror or
the violin crafting skills

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.300 align:middle line:10%
of the Master
Stradivarius, the discovery

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:10%
of these mysterious lamps
was not always a welcome one.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.580 align:middle line:84%
We can only imagine if
you were to travel back

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.540 align:middle line:84%
in time to the Middle Ages today
and take pictures or play music

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:84%
with your smartphone,
you would probably

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.390 align:middle line:90%
be on trial for witchcraft.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
This was the position of
the early church fathers

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
like Saint Augustine
in the 4th century

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:84%
who rebuked the ever-burning
lamps as the work of the devil.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:84%
He mentions in his writings
that one of these lamps

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:84%
was found in Egypt outside
of a great temple dedicated

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:90%
to Venus.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
a later scholar

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.670 align:middle line:84%
of Saint Augustine's
works, Ludovicus Vives,

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.640 align:middle line:84%
disagreed with his position
that the lamps are evil.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:84%
He believed that
they were the work

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:90%
of wise and knowledgeable men.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
He even wrote that a
perpetually burning

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle line:84%
lamp was discovered in his
father's time of 1580 CE.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And according to
inscriptions, it

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:84%
had been lit for
over 1,500 years

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:84%
but fell apart when
it was touched.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the
view that the lamps

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:84%
were the work of
devils and demons

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
was a common misconception
during the reign

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.570 align:middle line:84%
of the great Christian king and
Byzantine emperor, Justinian.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:10%
Much like the
destructive escapades

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.940 align:middle line:10%
of the Goths and Vandals,
this superstitious belief

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.550 align:middle line:10%
about the lamps being
evil caused many of them

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:10%
to unnecessarily be destroyed
out of pure ignorance.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happened when

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
one was discovered by the
soldiers of the Persian

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:84%
King, Chosroes, in 527 CE at
the gates of Antioch or Edessa

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:90%
in Syria.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:84%
We're told it was there
that a lamp burned

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:84%
brightly for over 500 years
above the gates to the city.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle line:84%
It was inside a sealed
niche next to a crucifix

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.589 align:middle line:84%
and had an inscription beside it
that said it was lit in 27 CE.

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:84%
There are countless legends
in the ancient world

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.549 align:middle line:90%
about sacred elements.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:84%
We're told that Prometheus
stole the fire of Zeus

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
from Mount Olympus to give
the gift of enlightenment

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:90%
to humanity.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
The Greek tradition
of this sacred fire

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
is kept alive today with the
carriers of the Olympic torch.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Subsequently in my
visits to Ireland,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I discovered it's not
uncommon to hear people today

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:84%
still practicing the tradition
of the hearth fire, which

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
is keeping the same fire
going for hundreds of years

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and passing it on
to other households.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.150 align:middle line:84%
We find a similar story
of sacred fires and lamps

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.280 align:middle line:84%
with the Jewish
celebration of Hanukkah

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.620 align:middle line:90%
or the Festival of Lights.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
In the Second Book
of Maccabees, we're

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.500 align:middle line:84%
told that after the Jews were
freed from captivity in Babylon

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.900 align:middle line:84%
by the Persian King
Cyrus the Great,

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.330 align:middle line:84%
they were allowed to
return home to Judea

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:90%
and rebuild a second temple.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Before they left, the priest
took fire from a sacred altar

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:90%
and hid it in a dry cistern.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:10%
When it was time to
rededicate the temple,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:10%
we're told that there was
no uncontaminated oil left.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's when they went to
fetch the secret fire that they

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:84%
had hidden but there was
only water in its place.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:84%
The priest then
constructed an altar

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:84%
at a wood and various
materials where

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
they poured the
strange liquid over it

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:90%
in front of crowds of people.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
According to the story,
that's when the clouds above

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:84%
disappeared and the sun came out
igniting the water into flames.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
This strange liquid for which
there was only enough supply

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:84%
for one day had
miraculously burned

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:90%
in the lamps for eight days.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.230 align:middle line:84%
This is celebrated in
Judaism to this day

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.930 align:middle line:84%
by lighting a candle in
the menorah for each night

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:90%
of the celebration.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:84%
We get a similar story
about combustible liquids

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:84%
from the Torah with the Prophet
Elijah, who poured water

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
over a sacrificial altar
that burst into flames

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:90%
once the sun came out.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
In alchemical doctrines, there
are strange views about fire

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and its connections to water
which they at least believed

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:90%
everything was made from.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Fire was an element,
one of four,

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:84%
with two contraries in nature,
three principles, and four

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:90%
elements.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
It does not need fuel
to consume but only

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.090 align:middle line:90%
as a means of detaining it.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:10%
Could this liquid fire,
a napalm-like fluid,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:10%
be the same as the Byzantium
flamethrower weapon

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:10%
that was known in the
ancient world as Greek fire?

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:84%
We're told that it
may have consisted

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:84%
of things like pine resin,
Naphtha, quicklime, calcium

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:90%
phosphide, sulfur, or niter.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
It also coincides with
a tradition practiced

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Rome by the
priestess Abacus who

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle line:84%
was said to drop fire into
water, which didn't go out.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
According to historians,
it was believed

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
to be a mixture of
sulfur with lime.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:84%
In other biblical accounts, we
find in the laws of Leviticus

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
that the altars of
Jehovah had fires

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that burned eternally and
were not allowed to go out.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
It has also been
suggested by scholars

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that the window
on Noah's Ark also

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:84%
contained a light that
never went out even

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.865 align:middle line:90%
during the darkest storm.

00:11:51.865 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:84%
There are many strange
accounts of the lamps

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
being hidden inside of urns
with strange liquid concoctions.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:10%
One of those comes from 1,500
CE where Franciscus Maturantius

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:10%
describes in a letter
to his friend, Alphenus,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:10%
he had discovered a
lamp that had stayed lit

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:10%
for over 1,500 years.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.490 align:middle line:84%
A worker at Ateste,
Italy near Padua,

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:84%
discovered a
sepulcher with an urn

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:84%
that was like one of
those Russian dolls that

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.260 align:middle line:84%
have layers upon layers
of dolls on the inside.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And inside of the urn,
there was another urn,

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and you had a smaller
urn inside of that one.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Inside of the smaller urn, there
was a brightly burning lamp,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and on each side of it, there
were vessels full of pure oil.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.310 align:middle line:84%
One was made of gold and
the other was of silver.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:84%
On the outside of the urn,
there was an inscription

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.940 align:middle line:84%
that read, "thieves, grasp
not this gift sacred to Pluto.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Ye are ignorant of what it
contains hidden, for Maximus

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Polybius has enclosed in this
small urn, elements digested

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:90%
with heavy toil.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Let abundance be present in
a second vase as a guardian

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.010 align:middle line:84%
to it, lest the value of
so much oil should perish."

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.160 align:middle line:84%
On the smaller vessel,
it said, "get ye hence,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:90%
most wicked thieves.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.120 align:middle line:84%
What do you desire
with your rolling eyes?

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Get ye hence with your
broad hatted Mercury

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
carrying a wand
with twisted snakes.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Maximus Polybius makes
this, his great offering,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:90%
sacred to Pluto."

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Another clue we get about
the mechanism of the lamps

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
is that we know the
ancients experimented

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.620 align:middle line:84%
with many different types of
wicks including metal wires,

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:84%
but they no doubt soon
realized that the oil could not

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.245 align:middle line:84%
be absorbed that way so they
switched to wool, cotton,

00:13:40.245 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:90%
and fibers instead.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.010 align:middle line:84%
The ever-burning
lamps were found

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.800 align:middle line:84%
with several types of
incombustible wicks that

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle line:84%
went by many different names,
such as Salamander's Wool,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:90%
we had Plum Alum.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:10%
And my personal favorite
was Asbestinum medium

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:10%
used by Albertus Magnus.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Of course these are probably
all just synonyms for asbestos

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.950 align:middle line:84%
which we know can
burn continuously

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.470 align:middle line:90%
without ever needing replacing.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:10%
This is confirmed by the
great theosophist Madame

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:10%
Blavatsky who tells us
about how Buddhist monks

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:10%
from secret temples
in Tibet, India,

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:10%
Japan possessed ever-burning
lamps that use asbestos wicks.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:84%
The mysterious
function of the lamps

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:84%
is described again
and again from those

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.760 align:middle line:90%
that encountered them.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
In the 1600s, we learn of a
Swiss soldier in Grenoble,

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
France that made a strange
discovery inside of-- you

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:90%
guessed it--

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:90%
a long hidden tomb.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Not only did he find one
of these strange lamps

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:84%
but said in his writings
that it burned continuously

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:90%
for months after removing it.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And it only went out after
accidentally breaking it.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But could there have
been an electrical source

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.890 align:middle line:84%
to these lamps as some have
speculated with the Baghdad

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:90%
battery?

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps the
type of irradiation

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:90%
from unknown isotopes?

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:84%
During the time of the second
king of Rome, Numa Pompilius,

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.840 align:middle line:84%
we're told that he
built a spherical temple

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.930 align:middle line:84%
with a perpetual burning
fire inside that allowed him

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.790 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with the gods.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.660 align:middle line:10%
It was dedicated to the nymph
Egeria, an elemental being.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:10%
We still don't know
how he made the fire

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:10%
but we know Numa experimented
with electricity,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:10%
and his successor,
to Tullus Hostilius

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:10%
died trying to collect
electric fluid or lightning

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:10%
bolts from storm clouds.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:84%
However, there are so many
mentionings of electricity

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient world that
even the great 19th century

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:84%
transcendentalist
Eliphas Levi tells us

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:84%
in The History of Magic that it
is certain that the Zoroastrian

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Magi had a means of producing
and directing electric power

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:90%
unknown to us.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:10%
We can also examine an
interesting story from France

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:10%
in the 13th century about
a rabbi named Yeshael

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:10%
who is said to have a strange
lamp outside of his house

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:10%
that burned continually without
needing to be replenished.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:84%
No matter how many
times he was asked

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
by the locals about
how it worked,

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
he would never
reveal its secret.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The idea that a
type of electricity

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:84%
was involved with this leads
us to the popular theory

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.430 align:middle line:84%
on how the lamps
might have worked

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.790 align:middle line:84%
by using a secret formula
of mercury only known

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.210 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient alchemist
priests or perhaps ignited

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.330 align:middle line:84%
with an electric
discharge of ionized gas.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:84%
After all, we've heard of
mercury acting like a power

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:84%
source and spinning
inside of Vimanas,

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:84%
or the flying machines
of ancient India.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Aside from the main
alchemical substances

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
of mercury, sulfur,
and salt, there

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:84%
was thought to be a fourth
principle in alchemy

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
called Azoth, which
is believed to be

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:84%
a hidden source of the
spirit fire, magnetism,

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.950 align:middle line:90%
or electricity.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Many believe it could
be plasma or the hidden

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:90%
dimensions around us.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:84%
The great alchemist
Fulcanelli once wrote in 1937,

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.630 align:middle line:90%
"the secret of alchemy is.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.600 align:middle line:10%
This there is a way of
manipulating matter and energy,

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:10%
so as to produce what
modern scientists call

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:10%
a field of force.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.069 align:middle line:10%
From this position,
he has access

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:10%
to the realities
which are ordinarily

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:10%
hidden from us by time and
space, matter and energy.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:10%
This is what we call
the great work."

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:10%
The history of discharged
lamps goes back to 1675

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:10%
with Jean Philippe
Picard, who observed

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:10%
that the empty space in
his mercury barometer

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:10%
jiggled when it was
carried around with him.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:10%
This was investigated
by Francis Hauksbee

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:10%
who tried to replicate it
and determine the cause.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Hauksbee went on to
successfully demonstrate

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:90%
gas discharge lamps in 1705.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:84%
He did this by using
an evacuated glass

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:84%
globe containing a
small amount of mercury

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and charged it with
static electricity

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
so that it became a
bright reading lamp.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.660 align:middle line:84%
The electric arc
was first documented

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
by Russian scientists
Vasily V. Petrov in 1802.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.590 align:middle line:84%
This made the way
for Sir Humphry Davy

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.050 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate the
electric arc at the Royal

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Institute of Great Britain.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And the rest is history,
as gas discharge lights

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:84%
have been found to be a
far more efficient light

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:84%
source than even our
incandescent light bulbs.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
But this doesn't
explain all the ever

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:84%
burning lamps as
we can only assume

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:84%
there were different styles and
techniques to making them work.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes lamps would go
out when the tomb was open

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and the seal was broken, as
perhaps some of the metal

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.630 align:middle line:84%
was made scorching
hot by electricity

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:84%
probably circulating in
a vacuum-sealed chamber.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.090 align:middle line:84%
At other times,
the lamps couldn't

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.910 align:middle line:84%
be put out unless you
drained a strange mercurius

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:90%
liquid from them.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.660 align:middle line:84%
According to esoteric
teachings, one should always

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:90%
look to the East for answers.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we have to look
no further than ancient China

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.110 align:middle line:90%
around the 3rd century BCE.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
We're told that emperor Qin
Shi Huang, founder of the Qin

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Dynasty and builder of the
foundations of the Great Wall

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:84%
was obsessed with
immortality and alchemy.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Not only was he obsessed
with finding formulas

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:84%
for an elixir of life,
which later proved

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:84%
to be fatal to
him, but according

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.155 align:middle line:84%
to historical accounts, he was
buried with ever-burning lamps.

00:19:13.155 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
We get a pretty good idea
about the fantastic treasures

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.960 align:middle line:84%
he was buried with after
a discovery was made

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.240 align:middle line:84%
in 1974 by farmers a Lintong
County outside of Xi'an,

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Shaanxi, inside of a
great mausoleum connected

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:84%
to him with three
pits containing 8,000

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:84%
ceremonially preserved
terracotta soldiers, 130

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:84%
chariots, with 520 horses
and 150 of them for cavalry.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Nearby in other pits, they
also found officials, acrobats,

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:90%
strongmen, and musicians.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:84%
What's very interesting
is that Sima Qian

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:84%
wrote that there were over
100 flowing rivers of mercury

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
inside this great place
in a ceiling decorated

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:84%
with the heavenly
bodies of Earth.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:84%
To this day, high
levels of mercury

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:84%
have been found in the
soil around the tomb.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:84%
In recent years,
there have also been

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:84%
reports of large
pools of mercury

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:84%
found underneath the Pyramid
of the Feathered Serpent

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:90%
in Teotihuacan in Mexico.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
But if there are mercury fumes
leaking from ancient tombs,

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.190 align:middle line:84%
this would most
certainly explain,

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:84%
as researchers have pointed
out, why some archaeologists

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and tomb raiders often complain
of getting sick or feeling

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.650 align:middle line:90%
nauseous after disturbing them.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, if we know
the lamps contained

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
a secret alchemical
formula, who then was

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.200 align:middle line:90%
responsible for creating them?

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we get clues
when we examine

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:84%
the founding of Christianity
in Rome by Constantine.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.730 align:middle line:84%
According to the
official narrative,

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
we're told that he saw vision
of a very important symbol

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
in the sky of the
Chi-Rho or Chi Rho cross

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
which is a P with
an X inside of it.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
We can still see this on
orthodox churches today.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:10%
Of course, most
theologians would tell you

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.700 align:middle line:10%
this symbol represents the
Greek letters for the Christ

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:10%
or the Christos, that
means the anointed one,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:10%
and is connected to
the anointing oil used

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.370 align:middle line:10%
in Greek temples for the wicks
of the ever-burning lamps that

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:10%
were found on altars.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle line:10%
One secret that
very few people know

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:10%
is that the symbol
of the Chi-Rho cross

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.520 align:middle line:10%
goes back to at least 2,500
years prior to Constantine.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
It is not only
important to Freemasonry

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:84%
but it was a symbol used by an
ancient secret society in Rome

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:84%
called the Collegium Artificum,
or the college of artificers,

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:90%
craftsmen, or masons.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And just like the initiates
of the Eleusinian Mysteries,

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:84%
which was the greatest
of all the mystery

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.380 align:middle line:84%
schools in antiquity
or the Dionysian

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Artificers, the early
Egyptian priests and kings,

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:84%
these are the
hidden groups which

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:84%
have inherited the
keys to the mysteries,

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:84%
seeding civilizations and
religions on this planet

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.520 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Their initiates possess
secret alchemical knowledge

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom which is why it
should come of no surprise

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that during the reign
of Henry VIII in 1534,

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.210 align:middle line:84%
an important discovery was
made when they opened up

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:15.110 align:middle line:84%
a sealed tomb of a wealthy man
buried in York, England who

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.420 align:middle line:90%
died during the 4th century.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.850 align:middle line:10%
Once inside the tomb,
they were shocked

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:10%
to discover that not only did
it contain an ever-burning lamp,

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:10%
but it belonged to none other
than emperor Constantine's

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:10%
father, Constantius
I of Chlorus who

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:10%
was a great initiate
of the artificers.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:10%
But there are many connections
to secret societies

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:10%
and perpetual burning fires
as even the fictional founder

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:10%
of the Rosicrucian,
Christian Rosenkreuz,

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.290 align:middle line:10%
which simply translates to
Christian of the Rosy Cross,

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.720 align:middle line:10%
was said to be found
with strange lamps

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:10%
when his tomb was allegedly
open by fraterists in 1604.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.050 align:middle line:84%
In the modern world, we've
made countless incredible

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:90%
discoveries.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
But the ancients understood
many secret proto sciences

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
such as how to accurately
work in hard stone,

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
move multi-ton blocks
over long distances,

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and they could even create
perpetually burning lamps.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:84%
With this amazing
alchemical technology,

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors could light
up ancient cities at night,

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:84%
illuminate the darkest
tombs, and navigate

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.340 align:middle line:84%
the deepest subterranean
complexes of the Earth.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminded of the
1900 different species

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:84%
of fireflies that flicker
around our backyards at night.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:84%
What you may not realize
is that the bug's ability

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.890 align:middle line:84%
to light themselves up comes
from a strange reaction

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:84%
to a chemical
known as luciferin.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:84%
This is triggered by
adenosine triphosphate

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
in a bonding
process that creates

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.800 align:middle line:84%
an enzyme in their tiny
bodies called luciferase.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And just like we discussed
with the reaction of mercury

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:84%
in the ever-burning
lamps luciferin

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:84%
is then turned into
oxyluciferin after it's

00:23:56.410 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:84%
exposed to oxygen through
these perforated little tubes

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:84%
in their abdomens, charging
them up with electrons

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and emitting bright
glowing lights.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
incredible about fireflies

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.860 align:middle line:84%
is since they have a
bioluminescent glow

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
in their larval state,
this is a natural deterrent

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.140 align:middle line:84%
to predators later
on who associate

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.120 align:middle line:90%
this light with a bitter taste.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Alternatively, they use
their light patterns

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:25.280 align:middle line:84%
to attract mates with
a similar glow to them.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So if we've learned
anything from the mystery

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:84%
of the ever-burning
lamps it's that they

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:84%
represent a spiritual fire that
lights up our hearts and minds.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the Kundalini that
moves up our spinal column

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and perpetually sparks
its brilliant flames

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:90%
as it reaches the top.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And much like the
purified oil, the burned

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:84%
continuously inside the lamps
our perpetual light is fueled

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:84%
by what the Zoroastrian says
are good thoughts, good words,

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:90%
and good deeds.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.400 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly,
we must always

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.420 align:middle line:84%
remember to shine our light
brightly as we wander aimlessly

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:90%
in the darkness.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:84%
It's only then can
you use your light

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:84%
to illuminate the path
for yourself and others.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.510 align:middle line:84%
The presence of the
ever-burning lamp found in tombs

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is a reminder of the continuity
of life in the eternal flame

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
To this day, no modern instances
of these ever-burning lamps

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:90%
have been found.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.085 align:middle line:84%
Because of that, a scientific
explanation for the phenomena

00:25:27.085 --> 00:25:27.885 align:middle line:90%
remains unknown.

00:25:27.885 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:90%


00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Until a new discovery
is made, the history

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
of these mysterious lamps
will remain just that--

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:37.800 align:middle line:90%
a mystery.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.130 align:middle line:10%
I'm Jonny Enoch, and thanks
