00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Jonny Enoch, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:10%
Since ancient times, there have
been legends of secret orders

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:10%
and great masters who live
long lifespans on the Earth

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.060 align:middle line:10%
and possess special types
of knowledge about alchemy

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.410 align:middle line:10%
and life extension.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Could these people
still exist in secret?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Could they be watching over
the development of humanity?

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
will be exploring

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:90%
immortality and alchemy.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a world where your
leaders, or gods, if you will,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.900 align:middle line:84%
lived on average over
30,000 years each.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Not possible, you might ask?

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Such a reaction
is understandable,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:84%
for in today's reality, this
would be a rather impossible

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
concept to grasp.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
However, might I suggest
the following story

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:90%
to tantalize your senses?

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:10%
While researching the
topic of human immortality

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:10%
I discovered the
eight immortal kings

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:10%
of Sumeria, which come from
the Sumerian kings list, who

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.070 align:middle line:10%
lived a total of 241,200 years.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you heard me correctly.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
To put this into
better perspective,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that is an average of
30,150 years per king.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
What becomes evidently
clear is that humans

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
used to live much longer,
but gradually our lifespans

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.100 align:middle line:84%
have gotten shorter and shorter
since those ancient times,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
especially after the story of
the Great Flood in the Bible.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:10%
In fact, these
eight kings closely

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:10%
coincide with the biblical
accounts from Adam to Noah,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.680 align:middle line:10%
although shorter in
years less two kings

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:10%
compared to the 10
biblical patriarchs.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Despite the differences,
the most important part

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:84%
to note from these
charts are the years

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that each of the
eight kings lived

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and their biblical counterparts,
followed by the Great Flood.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, contemporary thinking
dismisses such stories

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:90%
as mythological.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, I've discovered
through my research

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.160 align:middle line:84%
that these type of stories have
an element of truth to them.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:90%
We call this allegory.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Finding the allegorical
truth within such a story

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.590 align:middle line:84%
is up to each person
or interpreter.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Never dismiss a story,
even if it's folklore,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.310 align:middle line:84%
because it is well known
that such tales always have

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:90%
an element of truth to them.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.720 align:middle line:84%
The important part
to consider here

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
is that the tale of the eight
immortal kings of Sumeria,

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:84%
who lived an average of
over 30,000 years each,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
is a clear example of
our human potential.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:84%
The question still
remains, however.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:90%
Is immortality really possible?

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
We have countless esoteric
authors and scholars

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:84%
who wrote about
immortality training

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:84%
in the secret mysteries or
ancient mystery schools,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:84%
not to mention in
our holy books.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Most interestingly,
the Old Testament

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.090 align:middle line:84%
mentions immortal stories,
like those of Elijah, Enoch,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Melchizedek, and Moses.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We are told that Elijah went
up by a whirlwind into heaven

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and that Enoch was translated
so that he should not see death

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and was taken by God.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:10%
We are also told that Moses
appeared in the transfiguration

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.340 align:middle line:10%
with Jesus.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.090 align:middle line:84%
We get numerous examples
of long lifespans

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:84%
in the first part of
the Book of Genesis,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:90%
as Adam lived 930 years.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Seth lived 912 years.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Methuselah lived 969 years,
while Noah lived 950 years.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:84%
We learn in Genesis 6:3
that the Elohim creator

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:84%
beings, or geneticists, looking
at the progress of humanity

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:84%
decided to limit our
lifespans to 120 years.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's
another perspective here,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.050 align:middle line:84%
that since the Book of Genesis
was written in probably

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:84%
the fourth and
sixth centuries BCE

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and it greatly borrowed from
the Sumerian creation story

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:84%
with the Enuma Elish,
that its events are

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.770 align:middle line:84%
based on things that
happen over hundreds

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
We could be looking at a
number of genetic factors

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.220 align:middle line:84%
here, including biological
and geographical clues

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
with the Great
Flood or cataclysms.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:84%
It even talks about how
in the days of Peleg

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.490 align:middle line:84%
the continents were
divided, or split up,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:90%
due to a great cataclysm.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:84%
This leads us to believe
that the Garden of Eden

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
could be another telling
of the Atlantis story,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
where we could apply scientific
terms here and be talking

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:84%
about the Pleistocene
period, or what

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
we call that period
before the last mini Ice

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Age, and the Holocene, after
the Ice Age up until now.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Later in Genesis, we
are told that Abraham

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:84%
lived to be 175 years old,
where it said in chapter 25:7,

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:84%
"and these are the days of the
years of Abraham's life, which

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
he lived," and "100, three
score, and 15 years."

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.126 align:middle line:84%
In the Mormon faith, it is
believed that John the Baptist,

00:05:17.126 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Peter, James, and
Moroni are still alive,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:84%
as it is written "In the
current dispensation,

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:84%
resurrected beings, including
John the Baptist, Peter, James,

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.670 align:middle line:90%
and Moroni."

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
We also learn in
Christian theology

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
that Adam and Eve and
all of their descendents

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:84%
lost their immortality
in the great fall

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:90%
from the Garden of Eden.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Throughout our histories
there are countless stories

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
about legendary immortals, like
the Sumerian king Ziusudra, who

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:84%
earned immortality
after the Great Flood,

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:84%
similar to the story of Noah,
who also lived 950 years, as

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:84%
well as Markandeya,
who was an ancient sage

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and a celebrated
devotee of both Shiva

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and Vishnu who became an
immortal at the age of 16.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Or how about the Greek legend
of Tithonus, or Aurora, who was

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:84%
granted eternal life
but not eternal youth.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Some might say that this story
is based on Greek mythology.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But truly, any student
of the esoteric sciences

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:84%
must understand that these
ancient tales give us

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:84%
important clues
about the mysteries.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most
famous immortal everyone

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
has heard of is the legendary
Count St. Germain, who

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.810 align:middle line:84%
was a mysterious Frenchman,
an intellectual, philosopher,

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Mason and Rosicrucian,
who traveled around Europe

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:90%
between 1710 and 1822.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Not only did he go
by many names but was

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.160 align:middle line:84%
known to frequent places
like France, London,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Russia, and Persia.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:84%
We are told he was fluent
in several languages.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And many who reported
seeing him said

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.860 align:middle line:84%
he was a middle-aged-looking
handsome man

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:84%
with dark hair and a powdered
face free from wrinkles

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:90%
and dressed in mostly all black.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.800 align:middle line:84%
We also know he was
a great intellectual.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
He was ambidextrous,
being able to write

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.060 align:middle line:84%
two different
manuscripts at once

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
with both hands at the
same time and could play

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:90%
multiple musical instruments.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
He was adored by
kings like Louis XV.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
He was consulted by scientists
and artists of his day.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It was also said that
he carried with him

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:84%
the famed elixir of life
that gave him longevity.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was well
versed in meditation

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and the teachings of
Buddhism and the Hindu faith.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.970 align:middle line:84%
From time to time, he would even
retreat for extended periods

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.270 align:middle line:84%
to India and in the
Himalayan mountains.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
St. Germain was said to
be known by many names

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:90%
and traveled in elite circles.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.180 align:middle line:84%
One popular idea is that he
was the son of Prince Rákóczi

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:90%
of Transylvania.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:84%
But according to theosophist
Francis Udny, St. Germain was,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:84%
in fact, not the son of
Prince Rákóczi, as some say,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:84%
but due to his age,
philosophical and mystical

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.630 align:middle line:84%
training, he was the one and
very same person as the prince

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.070 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Udny also believed that St.
Germain faked his own death

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and was born Francis
Bacon in 1626.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.710 align:middle line:10%
He became Francis Rákóczy
in 1735 and the Comte de St.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:10%
Germain in 1784.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:10%
It is also a popular
belief that St. Germain was

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:10%
the mysterious
visitor who intervened

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.780 align:middle line:10%
at the signing of the
Declaration of Independence

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:10%
on July 4, 1776, at the
founding of America,

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:10%
as it was reported in the
personal diaries of Thomas

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:10%
Jefferson that an
unknown visitor appeared

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:10%
from behind closed doors and
impressed upon the frightened

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:10%
delegates that it was
necessary for them to sign

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:10%
this important
historical document

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:10%
and that God meant for
America to be free.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.880 align:middle line:10%


00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:10%
This man was not in the
original John Trumbull

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:10%
painting of the signing of the
Declaration of Independence.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And since Jefferson was featured
on the front of the $2 bill

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and this was his
story, I've often

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:84%
wondered if this could be
a reference to St. Germain.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle line:84%
St. Germain was
known to initiate

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:84%
into the mortal traditions, like
Egyptian-based Masonic lodges

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:90%
around Europe.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there are countless
hidden organizations which

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:90%
you've probably never heard of.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.540 align:middle line:84%
These secret societies
are like a pyramid

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:84%
as it gets very
narrow at the top.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
The best way to
think of these groups

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:84%
is like a prerequisite or
an educational training

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:84%
requirement of the
mystery schools

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
before a worthy
candidate is chosen

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:84%
by one of the countless hidden
fraternities of the world which

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:90%
might just be run by immortals.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we get clues
about this when

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:84%
we examine the G in the middle
of the emblem for Freemasonry,

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:84%
which is the compass
and the square

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:84%
or the tools of
the master builder.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of the less known and
more esoteric meetings of the G

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:07.400 align:middle line:84%
are generativity, as in
regeneration and immortality.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Then we have gravitation,
which is the law of attraction.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And finally, G for Germain, as
in St. Germain, a contemporary,

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:84%
if not the same person,
as Sir Francis Bacon,

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:84%
who is the father
of modern Masonry.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Also most curiously in
the 1700s, French Masons

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:84%
passed around a
triangular-shaped book

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:84%
belonging to St.
Germain that was written

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:90%
on vellum or parchment paper.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And it contained alchemical
and esoteric symbols.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.700 align:middle line:84%
This book was later acquired by
Manly P. Hall for his library

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:90%
from a Sotheby's auction.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Its triangular shape
is symbolically

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:84%
important to alchemy because its
symbol is 3 times 3 elements,

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
as symbolized
amongst other things

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:84%
by the 33rd degree
of Freemasonry.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:84%
This is also the
number of emanations

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:84%
from the root of the divine
tree with our Kundalini energies

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.260 align:middle line:84%
that move up the 33
vertebrae of the spine

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and awaken the spirit fire
within, like the Phoenix that

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:90%
rises from the ashes.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.340 align:middle line:84%
If you look outside
the Skull and Bones

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Club of Yale
University, you will

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:84%
find a skull and bones
that says 322 underneath it

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:90%
on their door.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:10%
This is no doubt a
reference to immortality,

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:10%
as it says in Genesis
3:22, "And the Lord God

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.910 align:middle line:10%
said, behold, the man
has become as one of us,

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:10%
to know good and evil.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:10%
And now, lest he
put forth his hand

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:10%
and take also of
the tree of life

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.580 align:middle line:10%
and eat it and live forever."

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:10%
We also find the symbolism
of the skull and crossbones

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:10%
in Masonry which represents the
death and resurrection of Hiram

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.290 align:middle line:10%
Abiff, or the Widow's son.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:10%
By reading Masonic authors
like Albert Pike, Eliphas Lévi,

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:10%
Manly P. Hall, I have come to
the conclusion that immortality

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:10%
is not only a possibility,
but a reality.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they're referring
to the immortality

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:10%
of the soul in the hereafter.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And at other times
in their works,

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
we learn that immortals have
lived among us for a long time

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and hidden their identities
and even faked their deaths

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
or had a philosopher's
death, as it's called,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:90%
for fear of persecution.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Along the lines of immortality
in secret societies

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.680 align:middle line:84%
there is a group reputedly
called the Great White Lodge,

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:90%
or the Great White Brotherhood.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
This group of ascended masters
spread spiritual knowledge

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:84%
to worthy humans who
thereby teach others.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Countless people have
talked to, written about,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and been guided by them,
including, but not limited,

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.880 align:middle line:84%
to Manly P. Hall, Helena
Petrovna Blavatsky, Alice

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Bailey, Guy Ballard, and
even Aleister Crowley.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.770 align:middle line:10%
Most interestingly, Ballard
founded the I Am movement

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:10%
after his meeting with St.
Germain, whose experiences

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:10%
were outlined in his book
"Unveiled Mysteries" in 1934.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Many people believe that
the Great White Lodge

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
is composed of immortal
supernatural beings that

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.300 align:middle line:84%
have great powers who
maintain an active watch

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:90%
over this world.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.650 align:middle line:84%
These ascended masters
continue to carry and teach

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.740 align:middle line:84%
ancient wisdom to
only the worthy.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Manly P. Hall discussed
this immortal fraternity

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
in his "Special Class
in Secret Doctrine"

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:84%
by saying, "The Great
White Brotherhood is

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
composed of initiates from
all parts of the Earth.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And these form the invisible
government of the Earth.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:84%
This group is a
lawmaking body deciding

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
with its clear intelligence
the needs of humanity

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and seeking to meet these needs
in the most efficient manner.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:10%
The power of the adepts over
the visible and invisible worlds

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:10%
enables them to invoke
the forces of nature

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:10%
to the attainment of
any particular end.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:10%
The Temple of the Great
White Lodge, we are told,

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.770 align:middle line:10%
stands upon an island
of permanent rock

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.700 align:middle line:10%
in the heart of the Gobi
Desert of Mongolia or Mongolian

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.980 align:middle line:10%
Tibet."

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:10%
That last part is
especially interesting

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:10%
as the Gobi Desert
is believed to be

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:19.070 align:middle line:10%
where the secret entrance to
the mythical Shambhala is.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
We know that German secret
societies, like the Vril

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Society, were
obsessed with the idea

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.140 align:middle line:84%
of an advanced and ancient
race of immortals that

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.030 align:middle line:84%
were survivors of
the cataclysms,

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.700 align:middle line:84%
living in subterranean
areas of the Earth

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
in a place called Agartha,
which Edward Bulwer-Lytton wrote

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:84%
about in his 1871 book
"The Coming Race."

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But could these
immortals possess

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
some sort of ancient Atlantean
life extension technology?

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And could they have
actually been missionaries

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:84%
of sorts that seeded all
of our ancient religions

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.635 align:middle line:90%
and traditions on this planet?

00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Manly P. Hall believed that many
of our most influential masters

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and teachers were members of
the mystery schools, which

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:84%
were established for the
redemption of the human race.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
He made it abundantly
clear that the Great White

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Lodge is comforted and happy if
even one human soul every 100

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.190 align:middle line:84%
years can find the
door and go in.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But where does the Great
White Lodge originate from?

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:84%
First of all, its
name has nothing

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.720 align:middle line:84%
to do with the ethnicity
of its initiates

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:84%
but was connected to a very
important 18th dynasty priestly

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
king of Egypt
called Thutmose III.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:84%
We know he was the
founder of the Great White

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Brotherhood, which was
written about extensively

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:90%
in Alexandria.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And much like the
stories we hear

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
about St. Germain and his
magical elixir of life,

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Thutmose III was known to eat
these strange pyramidal-shaped

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:52.690 align:middle line:84%
white cakes, hence the name
the Great White Brotherhood.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But let's come back to
him in just a moment.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And let's look at where this
practice originated from.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:10%
When we go back and
examine ancient Egypt,

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.700 align:middle line:10%
it was never called Egypt.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:84%
That was from the Greeks
who called it Aegyptus.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.670 align:middle line:84%
The true name for Egypt
was Khem, or Khemit,

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:90%
which means the black land.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And it refers to its
dark, mineral-rich soils.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Once a year at the beginning
of July when the star Sirius

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.060 align:middle line:84%
would appear
brightly in the sky,

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle line:84%
the Nile would
flood up at Abydos

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.830 align:middle line:84%
with a black,
mineral-rich material

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:84%
soil that was
collected and processed

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
for extraction at the
back of the Osireion,

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:84%
which is named after one of the
progenitor gods of Egypt named

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Osiris, who actually was a
giant with an elongated head.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And he is named after Sirius,
like O-siris or O-sirius.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.580 align:middle line:84%
At the back of Abydos
in the Osireion

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
where these materials would
flood up and be processed

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.320 align:middle line:84%
from the Nile the
walls are covered

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:84%
in the flower of life patterns,
as in everlasting life,

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:84%
perfectly etched onto
the walls as if they've

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:90%
been done with a laser.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:10%
The priest chemists
of Egypt would then

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:10%
extract this black material
through a secret alchemical

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.099 align:middle line:10%
procedure and turn it into
a white powder of gold,

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:15.780 align:middle line:10%
creating these cakes
called mufcuts, manna,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:10%
or as the Greek
Septuagint Bible calls it,

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:10%
the bread of the presence.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:84%
When consumed, this material
became bioelectrical,

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.630 align:middle line:84%
upgrading the body's mental
capacity, physical health,

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and energy fields over time,
causing physical regeneration

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.100 align:middle line:84%
when combined with
spiritual practices.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.280 align:middle line:10%
When visiting these temples
over the years with Egyptologist

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:10%
Mohamed Ibrahim,
I would tell him

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:10%
about the mufcuts and the
legends of white gold,

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:10%
and he would always
dismiss them.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Until 2019, at the Abydos temple
we discovered the inscriptions

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:84%
on the walls for
the chosen initiates

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:84%
needing to eat these
white cakes in order

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.510 align:middle line:84%
to walk through a false
door to the nethers,

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:90%
or to the gods and immortals.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Mohamed was shocked
to discover the truth

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:90%
about what they reveal.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:84%
These sorts of entrances are
not unusual in certain temples.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:84%
But at this
particular place there

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:84%
are seven holy of holies that
say they are star gates outside

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:90%
of these doors.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And it has been suggested that
this strange substance appears

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.510 align:middle line:84%
to be the key, or DNA
upgrade, if you will,

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:90%
to be able to access them.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:84%
On the same trip, I was
joined by the British lawyer

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and researcher JP Hague, who
is also a gifted clairvoyant.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:84%
As we walked around
Abydos temple,

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:84%
he happened to be suddenly
overwhelmed by a vision

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian priests in long,
flowing white robes and hats

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.650 align:middle line:84%
who are cooking
up these materials

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:84%
at fiery hot temperatures
in a preparation room

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:90%
towards the rear of the complex.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
This led us to a
narrow, long room where

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:84%
we could see the dark residue,
or a blackened chimney hole,

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.830 align:middle line:84%
on the roof indicated by the
corresponding instructions

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.020 align:middle line:84%
on the hieroglyphics
and surrounding reliefs

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:84%
that this was where the
priest class were preparing

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and administering
these sacred materials

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:90%
to give to worthy initiates.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:84%
These impressions are consistent
with the discoveries made

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.680 align:middle line:84%
by Sir William Flinders
Petrie who in 1904 ventured

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.650 align:middle line:84%
into the Sinai with the
British Royal Society

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:84%
while looking for
the Moses mountain,

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:84%
otherwise known today
as Serabit el-Khadim.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
It was there that he uncovered
a secret cave temple dedicated

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.520 align:middle line:84%
to the goddess Hathor, which
had these hermetically sealed

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.070 align:middle line:90%
chambers full of a white powder.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Here we find the instructions,
or hieroglyphics, up

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
on the reliefs that
we see on the walls

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:84%
for ritualistically taking this
strange alchemical material,

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:84%
which they were
probably extracting

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:90%
from water in the Dead Sea.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:84%
We find up on the
walls there was

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.710 align:middle line:84%
a list of all the royal lineages
from the 4th all the way up

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:84%
to the 19th dynasty that
were most likely consuming

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
this when they
visited the temple.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, when
you examine the Moses story

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.550 align:middle line:84%
in Exodus 32:20
of the Bible that

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:84%
happened at this exact place we
are told that Moses comes down

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.420 align:middle line:84%
from the mountain
after receiving

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
the edicts of the decalogue,
so the Ten Commandments,

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.790 align:middle line:90%
from the fiery finger of God.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And he sees that
the Israelites have

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
fashioned a golden
calf to worship out

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:90%
of the spoils of Egypt.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.850 align:middle line:84%
At that point, Moses
becomes furious.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:90%
He orders them to destroy it.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Burn it.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Grind it to a powder
and consume it.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:10%
This was obviously some
sort of purification process

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:10%
of their bodies.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Not only is this
passage very strange

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:84%
as gold doesn't typically burn
up and turn into a powder.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:90%
It smolders and melts.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:84%
But you might also recall that
Flinders Petrie discovered

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.180 align:middle line:84%
that this was a secret
temple dedicated

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
to the goddess Hathor, who
also had the ears of the calf.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.490 align:middle line:84%
We can only speculate that
alchemy must have originated

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.240 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantis and was deposited
into India and northern Africa

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:90%
through the Egyptian mysteries.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:84%
It remained there for
thousands of years

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:84%
until the Arabs brought it
to Europe with alchemia,

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:84%
where its secret has stayed
preserved for centuries.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:10%
This leads us to other
important figures

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:10%
that possess the
elixir of life, such as

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:10%
the Swiss-German-born
toxicologist

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:10%
and alchemist Paracelsus.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.000 align:middle line:84%
He is said to have
sprinkled a little bit

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
of this white powdery substance
around when people were ill

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:90%
or they were sick.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And they would be
miraculously healed

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:90%
from all of their ailments.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.950 align:middle line:10%
The substance was called
the philosopher's stone

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:44.150 align:middle line:10%
by the 15th-century French
alchemist Nicolas Flamel.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the places we get the
greatest clues about alchemy

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:84%
comes from one of
my absolute favorite

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and most beautiful
esoteric cities

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:84%
in Europe, which is Prague
in the Czech Republic.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:10%
Most notably, it was home
to the 17th-century ruler

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:10%
Rudolf II, an eccentric
member of the Hapsburg family

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:10%
who was obsessed with strange
grimoires, clocks, art,

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:10%
mathematics, and collecting
rare botanical specimens

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:10%
from around the world.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:84%
He was also obsessed
with alchemy

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and believed that
magic could ward off

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.550 align:middle line:84%
the invaders of
the Ottoman Empire.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So he invited all
the famous alchemists

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and magicians of his
day there, making

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Prague an esoteric haven.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:84%
To this day, you can visit
alchemy museums there,

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:84%
go into underground
passageways that

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:84%
were used by the alchemists,
walk through the Golden Lane

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and see the powder tower
where famous occultists

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
like John Dee and Edward
Kelley were known to frequent.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
when I've looked

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:84%
at Rudolf II's private art
collection at the Prague

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Castle, we find many esoteric,
erotic, and alchemical pieces.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But most notably,
when I was there

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I observed he had a painting
from Manna, the white gold,

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:84%
revealing that he had a keen
interest in the philosopher's

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:90%
stone.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:84%
In my conversations with
legendary esoteric researcher

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Jay Weidner, he tells
me that the alchemist

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:84%
knows that the first
half of their life

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:84%
must be spent working
on life extension

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
by gathering Prana
from the elements,

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:84%
including a hidden
one in nature known

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.740 align:middle line:84%
to give a tremendous
boost to your life force.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
These elements include
air, wind, fire, and water,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.590 align:middle line:84%
which in physics
are like the four

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
states of matter with solids,
liquids, gases, and plasma.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
The first part of your life
involves extending your life.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.663 align:middle line:84%
And the second part is involved
in creating the stone, which

00:23:36.663 --> 00:23:38.330 align:middle line:84%
probably doesn't take
place until you're

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.950 align:middle line:90%
around 120 years of age.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.490 align:middle line:84%
The reason that one wants
to extend their life

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:84%
is to give them enough
time to perfect the stone.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes this can take many
years, sometimes decades.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:84%
If you discover the secret
of the philosopher's stone

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:84%
at 70 years of age, it might be
too late to cultivate the prima

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.940 align:middle line:90%
materia needed for the stone.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is why life
extension becomes

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.705 align:middle line:90%
so paramount in your quest.

00:24:02.705 --> 00:24:05.900 align:middle line:90%


00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.760 align:middle line:10%
In the case of
Wilhelm Reich, who

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.070 align:middle line:10%
after years of working
with orgone, which

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:10%
is a form of plasma,
Reich discovered

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.290 align:middle line:10%
that he was glowing blue just
like the reports of people

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.880 align:middle line:10%
seeing immortals.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.760 align:middle line:84%
But we can gather some
clues about this process

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:84%
from the French
alchemist Fulcanelli,

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
who said in 1937 "the
vital thing is not

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.110 align:middle line:84%
the transmutation of metals
but that of the experimenter

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.100 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.950 align:middle line:84%
It is an ancient secret
that a few people

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:90%
rediscover each century.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, only a
handful are successful."

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.830 align:middle line:84%
In other words, another
way of looking at this

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:84%
is that the philosopher's
stone is really your soul

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and that you are
regenerating from the inside

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.370 align:middle line:84%
out with an ascended body that
is similar to what churchgoers

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:57.000 align:middle line:84%
call the resurrection body and
the Buddhists call the rainbow

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.170 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.790 align:middle line:84%
That brings us back to the story
of the priestly King Thutmose

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.020 align:middle line:90%
III from Egypt.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.270 align:middle line:10%
When you visit Karnak
temple in Egypt

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:10%
where Thutmose III would
hang out at the back,

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:10%
we find glyphs on
the walls cataloging

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.590 align:middle line:10%
the inventory of his
treasury, which strangely

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.820 align:middle line:10%
enough accounts for white
cakes, or a type of bread made

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:10%
of gold, listed next to
the other gold, silver,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.678 align:middle line:10%
and precious jewels
in his collection.

00:25:24.678 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps one day in
the future we will

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.500 align:middle line:84%
discover a compound
in nature that

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.350 align:middle line:84%
will increase our longevity
and body functionality.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:90%


00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.130 align:middle line:84%
The reality is the ancient
mysteries knew how to do this

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and taught that we could live
much longer than previously

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:84%
thought if only we
desire it and study it.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Immortality is not
just a lost art.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have been told there
are masters living among us now

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:84%
that continue to
instruct humanity

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:90%
from behind the scenes.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Simply stated, it
is a universal law

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that such a mortal knowledge
must be earned and never given.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Whenever one realizes the truth
of an immortal existence, that

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:11.490 align:middle line:84%
immortality is not just of the
soul but the physical body as

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.450 align:middle line:84%
well, and how it is a choice
that we can aspire to evolve

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.570 align:middle line:84%
to, these immortals
will come out of hiding

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and reveal their secrets
to us once and for all.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:90%
