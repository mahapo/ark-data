featuring amazing superfood

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:90%
blender recipes.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.635 align:middle line:84%
We're going to demonstrate
those recipes for you.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.972 align:middle line:84%
Right here on camera so that
you can make them yourself.

00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That's right
Mike you have a recipe

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.308 align:middle line:84%
that you've used
for a long time.

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:42.977 align:middle line:84%
So, go ahead and show
us how to make it.

00:00:42.977 --> 00:00:43.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: OK great.

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:44.812 align:middle line:90%
Now, we've got a lot

00:00:44.812 --> 00:00:46.046 align:middle line:84%
of different recipes
here for you today.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.649 align:middle line:90%
This one is a detox recipe.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.886 align:middle line:84%
It's based on aloe vera gel
which I'm going to show you how

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:55.055 align:middle line:84%
to fillet an aloe leaf
and get just the gel.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Fresh
organic aloe by the way.

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:57.791 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's true.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:58.826 align:middle line:90%
And, this is from my own yard.

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:00.794 align:middle line:90%
I grow aloe to eat it.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:90%
And then, were using ascorbate.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.001 align:middle line:84%
A buffered form of Vitamin C,
it's buffered with magnesium

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.804 align:middle line:84%
and some other minerals,
potassium for example.

00:01:09.804 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's to support
detoxification pathways,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.643 align:middle line:84%
for people who might be
experiencing you know exposure

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:17.878 align:middle line:84%
to toxic chemicals,
exposure to heavy metals

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:21.147 align:middle line:84%
which we all are exposed
to in foods and medicines.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:24.251 align:middle line:84%
This is perfect plus
freeze-dried

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:90%
organic raspberries.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.923 align:middle line:84%
That's the final
mystery ingredient

00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:30.157 align:middle line:90%
that makes it super delicious.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.259 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I can't wait
for you to try this Ed.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.028 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I've never tried
it and I'm looking forward

00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:36.797 align:middle line:84%
to trying it because I
love-- I'm the detox man.

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.399 align:middle line:90%
I'm constantly detoxing myself.

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:39.733 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm looking forward
to trying it.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:40.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right, let's do it.

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:43.504 align:middle line:84%
So, I've started this with
some filtered rain water

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:45.139 align:middle line:90%
in the in the blender here.

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:48.141 align:middle line:84%
And, I'm wearing gloves so that
I don't you know contaminate the

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:50.077 align:middle line:84%
aloe vera gel which
is kind of gooey.

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:52.379 align:middle line:84%
So, we're going to
start by slicing

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.147 align:middle line:90%
and filleting the aloe vera gel.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.684 align:middle line:84%
First, I'm going to
take a section here.

00:01:56.684 --> 00:01:58.352 align:middle line:84%
This is the piece that
we're going to use.

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:01.789 align:middle line:84%
We're going to harvest
the aloe meat so to speak.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.258 align:middle line:84%
We're actually going
to sort of fillet this

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:07.561 align:middle line:84%
by slicing off the
top layer first.

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:14.835 align:middle line:84%
And then, you take the sides and
simply slice the side skins off.

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:17.972 align:middle line:84%
There's one, and you can
also rub these on your skin,

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
on your face they make amazing
natural skin care materials.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.278 align:middle line:90%
Slice the other side.

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:25.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So,
you basically want

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.982 align:middle line:90%
to use one leaf then per drink?

00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:28.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:02:28.816 --> 00:02:30.317 align:middle line:90%
You want to use one whole leaf.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:31.986 align:middle line:84%
Now, for this you're going
to apply pressure and then,

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:35.788 align:middle line:84%
your going to fillet the gel
as you slide your fingers down.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:39.126 align:middle line:84%
And, you're going to get the
gel out but not the skin.

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:40.526 align:middle line:84%
And, if you've done
it correctly then

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:45.065 align:middle line:84%
when you're done you should
have a mostly transparent gel

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:46.333 align:middle line:90%
that you can hopefully see here.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's kind of gooey
but it's super healthy.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.336 align:middle line:90%
We're going to eat this.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.639 align:middle line:90%
We're going to drink this.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:90%
So, I put it in the blender.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Very high in
mucopolysaccharides which are--

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Absolutely.

00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:59.947 align:middle line:84%
It's really great for digestion,
for Crohn's, for any kind

00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:01.448 align:middle line:90%
of irritable bowel syndrome.

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:04.752 align:middle line:84%
For people who have, you know
digestive disorders or problems

00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:07.421 align:middle line:84%
that they want to have something
soothing go through them.

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.822 align:middle line:90%
This is fantastic.

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:12.393 align:middle line:84%
Now Ed, give us a spoonful
of the buffered ascorbate,

00:03:12.393 --> 00:03:15.229 align:middle line:84%
that's going to give us
a really high potency,

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.732 align:middle line:84%
super delicious vitamin
C with other minerals.

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:20.134 align:middle line:90%
It's already going to work.

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And, give us about half of
that container if you would

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.806 align:middle line:84%
of freeze-dried organic
raspberries.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:28.375 align:middle line:90%
These are grown in the USA.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:29.777 align:middle line:90%
And, they are completely free

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:31.679 align:middle line:84%
from pesticides we've
also tested these

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:90%
for all heavy metals.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.315 align:middle line:90%
Totally free of all heavy metals

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:36.984 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Very important
use all organic ingredients

00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:38.185 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:39.586 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So now, were just
going to blend this up.

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.689 align:middle line:90%
[ Noise ]

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.393 align:middle line:84%
[Background Noise] If the glass
is ready, that's all we need.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:50.998 align:middle line:84%
The aloe, you can't even taste
it when you use fresh aloe.

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:54.468 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever had sort of
store-bought aloe drinks.

00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:55.536 align:middle line:90%
You have may have noticed,

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
they have a little
bit of a bitter taste.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.405 align:middle line:84%
Because they're normally
pasteurized

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.341 align:middle line:84%
or they're preserved
with other chemicals.

00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why I recommend
you grow your own aloe

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.445 align:middle line:84%
and fillet it just
like I did here.

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:05.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And, it's
really easy to grow.

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.915 align:middle line:84%
I mean you can grow in a
pot or grow it on your yard.

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.084 align:middle line:90%
I mean, especially down South.

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:12.052 align:middle line:84%
That does look good and
you've made a good point

00:04:12.052 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:90%
about the aloe.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.622 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of people
don't like the taste of aloe.

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:18.225 align:middle line:84%
And, another thing it's great
for is just constipation.

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:20.026 align:middle line:84%
Think about how many
people are constipated

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:21.362 align:middle line:90%
on the world these days.

00:04:21.362 --> 00:04:22.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Absolutely.

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:24.064 align:middle line:90%
Now, if you want to sweeten this

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:25.766 align:middle line:84%
up a little bit I
also have some stevia.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.836 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm going to put just a
little touch of stevia in mine.

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:30.938 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you want
any stevia in yours or not.

00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:31.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Sure.

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll have a little bit.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It helps to
sweeten up a little bit.

00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:35.309 align:middle line:84%
Here we'll use the
knife to stir it.

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:36.744 align:middle line:90%
Mix it up a little bit.

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:38.312 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to presume
that you wanted

00:04:38.312 --> 00:04:40.414 align:middle line:84%
to eat stevia, not
everybody does.

00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:41.682 align:middle line:90%
But, I like it.

00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:42.883 align:middle line:90%
So, there you go.

00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So, when you drink this
then, what your doing is,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.491 align:middle line:84%
is you're giving yourself
live food which from the aloe.

00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:55.062 align:middle line:84%
You're giving yourself these
incredibly soothing healing

00:04:55.062 --> 00:04:58.365 align:middle line:84%
polysaccharides from the aloe
which are very long chained.

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
You noticed I didn't
blend it very long.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:01.969 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: I didn't want to tear

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:03.737 align:middle line:84%
up the actual polysaccharides
from the aloe.

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.607 align:middle line:84%
So, you don't want to over
blend it because of that.

00:05:06.607 --> 00:05:08.709 align:middle line:90%
But, now give it a drink Ed.

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:90%
See what you think.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean this is a
super fast way to have a drink.

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:14.415 align:middle line:84%
I mean Mike that only took
a couple minutes to do that.

00:05:14.415 --> 00:05:17.985 align:middle line:90%
Let me try it out.

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:18.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Super easy.

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:19.319 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Wow.

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:21.588 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Ain't that nice?

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:22.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Amazingly good.

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.224 align:middle line:90%
I must say.

00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:26.193 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So, describe to the
viewer, what does it taste like.

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:29.963 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It taste like-- it
kind of taste like raspberry tea

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:30.998 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:33.767 align:middle line:84%
I mean kind of like
a real refreshing.

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:35.903 align:middle line:84%
I even had a chunk in
there, I think of aloe

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:37.104 align:middle line:90%
that I that I chewed up.

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:37.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yup.

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:38.539 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:39.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It
wasn't bad at all.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.141 align:middle line:90%
It's got a good consistency.

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:42.409 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.311 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: But, do you taste
any bitterness whatsoever.

00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.681 align:middle line:84%
Do you taste any
aloe taste at all?

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:48.882 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: No, no.

00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:51.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It's completely
masked by the raspberries

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.487 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit of stevia.

00:05:53.487 --> 00:05:55.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And, Mike what
probably the best time for this,

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:57.758 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just you know
guessing because of the aloe

00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:00.093 align:middle line:84%
and everything would probably
be on the morning because that's

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:03.163 align:middle line:84%
when your system
needs to detoxify.

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:04.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Absolutely.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You know
your body your body pushes

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:06.333 align:middle line:84%
out all those toxins
during the night.

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:08.335 align:middle line:90%
And then, in the morning is

00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:84%
when you should have
something like this.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Some live food, a lot of water
to push that all those toxins

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.443 align:middle line:84%
that your body pushed
out at night

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.946 align:middle line:84%
and to have a good
healthy bowel movement.

00:06:18.946 --> 00:06:20.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Definitely.

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:21.682 align:middle line:84%
While you're talking,
I'm drinking

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:84%
because I'm really
enjoying this drink.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.553 align:middle line:84%
So, this is also
very inexpensive.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.156 align:middle line:84%
So, a lot of people are
concerned about the cost

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:32.259 align:middle line:84%
of eating organic or the
cost of having superfoods.

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:34.995 align:middle line:84%
Well, the aloe vera
you grow it for free.

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:36.497 align:middle line:90%
All right, it's free.

00:06:36.497 --> 00:06:37.898 align:middle line:84%
And, if you live in
a colder climate,

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.933 align:middle line:84%
you can bring it indoors in
the winter, put it outdoors

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:41.835 align:middle line:84%
in the spring, summer,
and early fall.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:43.303 align:middle line:90%
Just don't let it freeze.

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:45.806 align:middle line:84%
The raspberries are
not that expensive.

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:48.809 align:middle line:84%
The ascorbate is
not that expensive.

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:52.012 align:middle line:84%
And, the water you know
is essentially free.

00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:55.115 align:middle line:84%
So, this is a great way to
give your body these nutrients

00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:56.783 align:middle line:84%
without spending a
fortune doing so.

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:59.586 align:middle line:84%
And like you said you know
its two minutes your done.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.188 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It's great
for the whole family too.

00:07:01.188 --> 00:07:02.756 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you have kids
you could just whip

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:03.891 align:middle line:90%
out a couple of batches.

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.593 align:middle line:84%
You saw how much that
makes, two full glasses.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.629 align:middle line:84%
I mean you could split
it up between four people

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and you know everybody
in your family.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.333 align:middle line:84%
Or you just add more water
and you could do, you know,

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:15.102 align:middle line:84%
have enough for six
people in the morning.

00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:15.736 align:middle line:90%
It'd be a good--

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.539 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You know it's
a great snack, it's healthy

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:20.607 align:middle line:84%
and the good thing
about it is it's raw.

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.876 align:middle line:84%
I mean your getting
all the live enzymes

00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:24.211 align:middle line:90%
and ingredients out of there.

00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:26.113 align:middle line:84%
I mean you have the
organic strawberries

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:26.847 align:middle line:90%
and you have the aloe--

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:27.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Raspberries.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:28.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean
the raspberries.

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And, about the
raspberries finally.

00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:32.019 align:middle line:84%
And then were going to move on
with the next recipe for you.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.521 align:middle line:84%
But, the raspberries
because they're freeze-dried.

00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Let me actually show
people the importance

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.892 align:middle line:90%
of the freeze-dried raspberry.

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Freeze-drying preserves fruits
more than any other method.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.467 align:middle line:84%
It leaves the color, the
flavor, and the texture

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:51.104 align:middle line:84%
and the phytochemicals,
the phytonutrients intact.

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:54.107 align:middle line:84%
So, compared to heat-drying
which is more destructive

00:07:54.107 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
to nutrients or you
know drum drying

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.147 align:middle line:84%
in the industry is often used
that destroys more nutrients.

00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:04.751 align:middle line:84%
Freeze-drying is the best way
to preserve the maximum amount

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:06.587 align:middle line:84%
of nutrients which is why
a lot of people who are

00:08:06.587 --> 00:08:08.055 align:middle line:90%
into survival foods

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:12.492 align:middle line:84%
or preparedness foods they
also store freeze-dried fruits

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.560 align:middle line:90%
and vegetables.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.896 align:middle line:84%
And, they last easily
you know five

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:18.031 align:middle line:84%
to ten years you can
make yourself a super

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:19.333 align:middle line:90%
nutritious drink.

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:22.235 align:middle line:84%
You know even if you're
living in a bunker

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:24.237 align:middle line:90%
after a nuclear accident.

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.607 align:middle line:84%
Anything, you can have it
anytime that's my point.

00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:29.843 align:middle line:84%
So, that's the aloe
detox raspberry recipe.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.211 align:middle line:90%
Hope you enjoyed that.

00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:34.513 align:middle line:84%
Now, coming right up next is
another recipe using avocados

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:35.849 align:middle line:90%
and cacao.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.785 align:middle line:84%
All right, continuing with
our amazing superfood recipes.

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have a cacao
avocado kind of an ice cream,

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.993 align:middle line:84%
like a chocolate ice cream
type of smoothie recipe based

00:08:45.993 --> 00:08:49.129 align:middle line:84%
on almond milk which was what we
have in the container right now.

00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:51.465 align:middle line:84%
Ed have you ever
tried this recipe?

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Actually I
have used avocados in recipes

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.269 align:middle line:84%
and I love using
avocados in recipes.

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.605 align:middle line:84%
I make my own almond
milk at home Mike.

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:03.443 align:middle line:84%
I get the non-irradiated almonds
from a farm out in California.

00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at like the
organic certification websites

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:11.284 align:middle line:84%
like CCOF, you can actually find
a list of certified providers

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:90%
and contact them directly.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And, it's wonderful when you
make your own almond milk.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:17.457 align:middle line:90%
It's just so refreshing to have.

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:18.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Absolutely.

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:21.395 align:middle line:84%
Today were using organic
off the shelf almond milk.

00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.664 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, making your
own is definitely better,

00:09:23.664 --> 00:09:24.898 align:middle line:90%
taste much better.

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.199 align:middle line:84%
But, let's go ahead and get
started with the recipe.

00:09:26.199 --> 00:09:29.002 align:middle line:84%
This is a very nourishing
and super delicious recipe.

00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:31.805 align:middle line:84%
Ed, you're going to
help me out right?

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:32.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely.

00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:33.473 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: OK.

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:34.841 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: What's
the first ingredient?

00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:36.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Hit me with a spoonful
of cacao powder over there.

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:39.079 align:middle line:84%
This is a certified
organic cacao powder,

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:42.082 align:middle line:84%
also tested in our lab
like all our ingredients.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Is that
enough right there or more?

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's probably enough.

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:46.887 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we get plenty
of the aroma in that.

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:50.691 align:middle line:84%
Hit me with a spoon of
the chollera powder.

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:52.859 align:middle line:84%
This goes really
well with chocolate

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:54.861 align:middle line:84%
because it's obviously
dark green

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:59.766 align:middle line:84%
but with chocolate the color
is wow, masked by the cacao

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.935 align:middle line:84%
and it's also got a great
nourishing effect on body.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Detoxification
too.

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:05.138 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yes.

00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:06.506 align:middle line:84%
Now we could also--
I recommend putting

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:09.476 align:middle line:84%
in some different superfood
powders and I brought a couple.

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:12.612 align:middle line:84%
I've got Boku Superfood
here just as an example.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.614 align:middle line:84%
We can put in half
a spoon of that

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.149 align:middle line:90%
or a scoop of that if you want.

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:16.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Place
a scoop in there?

00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:18.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah that's good.

00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And then a scoop of the
Metacore, there you go,

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.827 align:middle line:84%
which is a hemp-based
chocolate protein powder

00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:28.195 align:middle line:90%
with some vanilla bean in it.

00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:30.230 align:middle line:90%
So it's really quite delicious.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.065 align:middle line:84%
You can use any powder
you want there are a lot

00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:35.001 align:middle line:84%
of great superfood powders
on the market so go ahead

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.236 align:middle line:90%
and choose whatever you want.

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Now thanks Ed.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.806 align:middle line:84%
I'm going also to add
in this from Artisana.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:47.114 align:middle line:84%
This is a coconut cacao-- a real
creamy super rich like a butter.

00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:49.349 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to put a
massive spoon of that

00:10:49.349 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
in because I love the taste
of the coconut with cacao.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.288 align:middle line:90%
So we have coconut and avocado.

00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:57.357 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to scoop
out the avocado here

00:10:57.357 --> 00:11:00.093 align:middle line:84%
so that we get the
avocado that we need.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:02.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And this looks
almost like a meal replacement.

00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:03.463 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's like--

00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:04.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:05.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: It's like a--

00:11:05.065 --> 00:11:06.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It's like a cereal.

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:07.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr Group: A super nutrient
with all the good fats, Omega 3,

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:09.536 align:middle line:90%
6, and 9 and the avocado.

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:13.373 align:middle line:84%
You have your hemp which is
high in protein, the almond milk

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:14.808 align:middle line:84%
which is high in
protein your banana

00:11:14.808 --> 00:11:16.176 align:middle line:90%
which is high in potassium--

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.377 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Adding a banana.

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:19.946 align:middle line:84%
Certified organic banana
of course, just to sweeten

00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:21.314 align:middle line:84%
up a little bit,
you don't have to do

00:11:21.314 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
that if you're diabetic you
probably don't want to do that.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But I like to add banana
in and where going to--

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.589 align:middle line:84%
by the end of this episode,
Ed we're going to be so full

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:30.791 align:middle line:90%
from all these superfoods.

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:33.693 align:middle line:84%
We are drinking these
between shots by the way.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So, and I'm adding a
little bit of stevia in.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.332 align:middle line:84%
And that's it we
are ready to blend.

00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:40.534 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready to enjoy this?

00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:41.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Let's blend
it up and see how it is.

00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:42.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: OK.

00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:43.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean,
everybody will love

00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:46.373 align:middle line:84%
to have a chocolate shake
recipe that's actually raw,

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:47.474 align:middle line:90%
live and healthy.

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:48.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Here we go.

00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:56.783 align:middle line:90%
[ Noise ]

00:11:56.783 --> 00:12:02.222 align:middle line:84%
All right, now notice the color
is really green, we'll show you

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:05.125 align:middle line:90%
in a cup-- you grab a cup.

00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:08.829 align:middle line:84%
Check out the color,
nice and rich

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:12.532 align:middle line:84%
like a chocolate,
smoothie shake.

00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:14.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It
is really thick.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.702 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah, super thick.

00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:16.903 align:middle line:84%
You can make it thinner
of course

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:19.172 align:middle line:84%
by adding more almond
milk if you want.

00:12:19.172 --> 00:12:20.674 align:middle line:90%
Or you can do-- if you want

00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:24.311 align:middle line:84%
to make it even thicker you can
add chia seeds to this recipe,

00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:26.346 align:middle line:84%
another ingredient
I really love.

00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:29.783 align:middle line:84%
So I'm interested to
see your reaction to it

00:12:29.783 --> 00:12:31.852 align:middle line:90%
because this is my recipe.

00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:32.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: All
right let me taste it.

00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:38.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So give me
shot what do you think?

00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:39.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: That is very good.

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:40.026 align:middle line:90%
It does I mean--

00:12:40.026 --> 00:12:41.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It's like
ice cream right?

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:42.796 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You can't really
even taste you know a lot

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:46.900 align:middle line:84%
of times when you put a lot
of green powders in drinks

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.837 align:middle line:84%
and you mix them up you have
kind of like that grassy taste.

00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:52.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Not here.

00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:54.808 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: But this, you
have a real chocolatey, creamy,

00:12:54.808 --> 00:12:55.876 align:middle line:90%
smoothie and it's almost

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:57.844 align:middle line:84%
like a fudge ice cream
bar or something.

00:12:57.844 --> 00:12:58.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah that's
a good point.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.981 align:middle line:84%
This reminds me when
I was young I use

00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to go Dairy Queen you
know before I learn

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.853 align:middle line:84%
about nutrition my family
would take us out we'd have

00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:09.956 align:middle line:84%
like a banana split with
the chocolate syrup on it.

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:10.657 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about?

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:11.691 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Oh I know.

00:13:11.691 --> 00:13:13.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: To me this
taste very similar

00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:15.862 align:middle line:84%
to a chocolate ice
cream banana split.

00:13:15.862 --> 00:13:18.198 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know you might think
that's impossible it couldn't

00:13:18.198 --> 00:13:19.266 align:middle line:90%
taste that way.

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:21.067 align:middle line:84%
Well try it yourself
because you're going

00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
to find it's really, really good
and you can adjust the taste

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.538 align:middle line:84%
by just adjusting
the ingredients.

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:26.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: You know what?

00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:28.675 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you another thing,
I've got two boys young boys

00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:29.910 align:middle line:90%
that are growing up and they--

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:34.581 align:middle line:84%
it is so hard to find foods
in the change up foods

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:39.386 align:middle line:84%
that are live that are healthy
and more than not something

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:42.923 align:middle line:84%
that the kids actually
like and will drink.

00:13:42.923 --> 00:13:47.894 align:middle line:84%
And you know all kids have
this you know sweet tooth

00:13:47.894 --> 00:13:49.195 align:middle line:90%
for everything.

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:51.231 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it's hard to
find alternatives especially

00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:53.099 align:middle line:84%
when you're going
to birthday parties

00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:55.602 align:middle line:84%
with all the other kids are
eating a bunch of, you know,

00:13:55.602 --> 00:13:58.271 align:middle line:84%
high fructose corn
syrup drinks and cakes

00:13:58.271 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:90%
with all kinds of dyes on them.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.843 align:middle line:84%
This is a good alternative for
parties or good alternative

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.312 align:middle line:90%
for your kids in the morning.

00:14:05.312 --> 00:14:06.446 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:14:06.446 --> 00:14:07.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And for kids
you can also you can add

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:13.119 align:middle line:84%
in essential mint oils and make
it a chocolate mint ice cream

00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:15.121 align:middle line:84%
smoothie if you describe
it that way.

00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:17.691 align:middle line:84%
You know the name
affects the perception

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.092 align:middle line:90%
in what you're drinking.

00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:22.162 align:middle line:84%
So you could even make it even
more green you know put a little

00:14:22.162 --> 00:14:25.665 align:middle line:84%
more avocado in it and put
the mint essential oil in it.

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:28.268 align:middle line:84%
And it would be like a chocolate
mint ice cream smoothie.

00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:29.836 align:middle line:84%
And what kid is going
to turn that down?

00:14:29.836 --> 00:14:31.237 align:middle line:84%
They're not they're
going to love it.

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:32.906 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And if you can
get a kid to put this kind

00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:36.076 align:middle line:84%
of nutrition in their body
you've won right there I mean--

00:14:36.076 --> 00:14:39.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Think about the
avocados too you know the battle

00:14:39.012 --> 00:14:42.916 align:middle line:84%
today with our diet is getting
healthy oils into your body.

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:45.652 align:middle line:84%
We don't want the soybean
oil the high Omega 6 oils,

00:14:45.652 --> 00:14:48.855 align:middle line:84%
the corn oil, it's all
GMO anyway, soy oil,

00:14:48.855 --> 00:14:53.059 align:middle line:84%
we want avocado oil-- this, you
know, flax oil, chia seed oil--

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:53.893 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Coconut oil.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Coconut oil exactly.

00:14:55.128 --> 00:14:55.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: It's in there.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:56.997 align:middle line:90%
Coconut oil is incredible.

00:14:56.997 --> 00:15:00.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: This recipe
delivers man, this is--

00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I drink a variation of this
everyday for breakfast.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.673 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not eating bacon
and sausage and toast

00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:10.643 align:middle line:84%
and sugar cereals and whatever
I don't know toast in jam

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:11.911 align:middle line:90%
or whatever people eat.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:16.216 align:middle line:84%
I am drinking this every
morning for my breakfast,

00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:19.352 align:middle line:84%
this is my breakfast and it has
been for I think four years now.

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:20.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Try that at home.

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:21.388 align:middle line:90%
I like it, cheers.

00:15:21.388 --> 00:15:23.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right cheers.

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:28.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Mike I love your
recipes but let me tell you

00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:32.032 align:middle line:84%
in the morning with kids in
school and everything I've got

00:15:32.032 --> 00:15:35.001 align:middle line:84%
to have a quick smoothie
or something

00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:38.872 align:middle line:84%
that can get all the nutrition
in to my kids and to me.

00:15:38.872 --> 00:15:41.141 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm usually in a hurry
and I know most people are

00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:43.209 align:middle line:90%
in a hurry in the morning.

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:44.477 align:middle line:90%
You know that's another thing,

00:15:44.477 --> 00:15:47.614 align:middle line:84%
people just don't take the
time to sit down and eat.

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.783 align:middle line:84%
I mean everything is just
rush, rush, rush, rush,

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:53.219 align:middle line:84%
rush and you know we did a
study not too long ago to figure

00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:56.256 align:middle line:84%
out what happens when people
are stressed out or when they're

00:15:56.256 --> 00:15:58.324 align:middle line:90%
in the sympathetic state.

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:01.461 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people we found
eat their meals, breakfast,

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.063 align:middle line:84%
lunch and dinner in
a sympathetic state.

00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:06.299 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't know what a
sympathetic state is that's a

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:07.767 align:middle line:90%
fight-or-flight response.

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:12.205 align:middle line:84%
That means that your body's
digestive system is not working

00:16:12.205 --> 00:16:15.341 align:middle line:84%
and your body is bringing all
the blood to the internal organs

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:19.079 align:middle line:84%
so you can runaway from whatever
you need to get away from.

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Which is
really breakfast,

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.182 align:middle line:90%
if it's a standard breakfast.

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Oh
my gosh, I know.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.153 align:middle line:84%
So you know really
everybody should be eating

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:30.657 align:middle line:84%
in a parasympathetic state
that's when you're relaxed,

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:33.293 align:middle line:84%
that's when you can
absorb your nutrients.

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:35.328 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing people
don't absorb nutrients.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:38.998 align:middle line:84%
So I have a real simple
recipe today that I

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:90%
like to share with everybody.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.769 align:middle line:84%
And this is like a
meal replacement.

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:46.039 align:middle line:84%
This is a protein replacement
this is something that's going

00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:49.876 align:middle line:84%
to fill you up and it's
super easy to make.

00:16:49.876 --> 00:16:51.611 align:middle line:90%
Now you can use any type

00:16:51.611 --> 00:16:55.915 align:middle line:84%
of raw organic protein
powder if you want.

00:16:55.915 --> 00:16:58.151 align:middle line:84%
Just make sure that
it's non-GMO.

00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:00.787 align:middle line:84%
I like to use this
one right here

00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:05.759 align:middle line:84%
which is the Warrior Food
Extreme this has a combination

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:09.863 align:middle line:84%
of non-GMO, rice
protein, hemp protein

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:11.798 align:middle line:90%
which I love hemp protein.

00:17:11.798 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Me too.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You know the
hemp oil is one molecule off

00:17:16.602 --> 00:17:19.438 align:middle line:84%
from the natural sebum that
you secrete in your skin.

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:21.941 align:middle line:84%
Your natural oils
that you secrete,

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:24.377 align:middle line:90%
that hemp oil is almost exactly.

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:28.214 align:middle line:84%
It makes it the closest plant
to the human body in the world.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:31.918 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely beneficial
and extremely nutritious.

00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:36.122 align:middle line:84%
What I like about this also is
it contains live enzymes you

00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:84%
know so many people are
enzyme deficient these days.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.363 align:middle line:84%
And I mean I personally take
enzymes you know enzymes

00:17:43.363 --> 00:17:44.964 align:middle line:84%
supplements on a
daily basis too.

00:17:44.964 --> 00:17:46.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Me too.

00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:48.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Just to you know
help clear the body help thin

00:17:48.668 --> 00:17:52.172 align:middle line:84%
the blood a little bit
because research has shown

00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:54.073 align:middle line:84%
that people start
running out of enzymes

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:56.543 align:middle line:84%
by the time they're
28 years old.

00:17:56.543 --> 00:17:58.811 align:middle line:84%
Not only that but
this has super green

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:03.583 align:middle line:84%
in it too blue-green algae,
and it's an amazing addition

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:04.951 align:middle line:90%
to add to the smoothie.

00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:08.488 align:middle line:84%
So first thing I'm going to do
is I start with almond milk.

00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And about a little
bit of water in there

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.425 align:middle line:84%
and of course I use
distilled water

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:13.993 align:middle line:84%
or purified water you
definitely don't want

00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:16.362 align:middle line:84%
to put tap water
in your smoothie.

00:18:16.362 --> 00:18:17.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Put fluoride
in you smoothie.

00:18:17.897 --> 00:18:18.898 align:middle line:90%
Enhances the flavor.

00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:20.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: All right so
how am I suppose to do--

00:18:22.402 --> 00:18:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I'm just going

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:30.310 align:middle line:84%
to take maybe a half tip heaping
spoon here, put it in there.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Now this is Jameth
Sheridan product right?

00:18:32.645 --> 00:18:33.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes it is.

00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:35.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So I noticed
it's all micronized.

00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:38.017 align:middle line:84%
He likes to make things
really small sizes

00:18:38.017 --> 00:18:41.187 align:middle line:84%
so that there's a lot of
surface area for absorption

00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
like when you open the lid you
can actually see some of the--

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.991 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You
could see the--

00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:46.926 align:middle line:84%
like the static electricity
comes out of it.

00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: [inaudible] alive.

00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:51.264 align:middle line:84%
The second thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to add banana,

00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:53.867 align:middle line:84%
I like to add a banana in
there just rich in fiber,

00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:55.401 align:middle line:84%
and just to sweeten
it up a little bit.

00:18:55.401 --> 00:18:58.137 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a family
drink and the kids you know,

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.906 align:middle line:84%
I have to make it to
where the kids like it.

00:18:59.906 --> 00:19:03.009 align:middle line:84%
And plus it kind of help them go
to the bathroom in the morning.

00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:05.945 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I'm going
to add is cinnamon,

00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:09.949 align:middle line:84%
you now cinnamon is one of the
spices that's just overlooked

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:12.151 align:middle line:84%
but it has so many
health benefits.

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:15.521 align:middle line:84%
It actually increases your
blood flow and to your

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:16.956 align:middle line:90%
and to your tissues, so it kind

00:19:16.956 --> 00:19:18.958 align:middle line:84%
of like gives little
energetic boast

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and
got you going.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And there's
also a lot of research

00:19:21.928 --> 00:19:25.164 align:middle line:84%
about cinnamon helping to
regulate blood sugar levels too.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:27.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So you know,
and it's used

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:29.235 align:middle line:84%
in Chinese medicine too
come to think of it.

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:30.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: It is.

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It's a mainstay
of Chinese medicine.

00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:35.108 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So I'll just put
a little cinnamon in there.

00:19:35.108 --> 00:19:37.143 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It's already starting
to look interesting Ed,

00:19:37.143 --> 00:19:38.411 align:middle line:90%
I have never tried this one.

00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:39.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I'm telling
you it's going to be good.

00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: OK.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And
what I like to use--

00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:44.317 align:middle line:84%
I mean and you know I could
take all these individual

00:19:44.317 --> 00:19:45.618 align:middle line:90%
ingredients separate.

00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:47.520 align:middle line:84%
But again you know I want
to do something pretty fast

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.624 align:middle line:84%
so this is a Cacao
Goji Superfood blend

00:19:51.624 --> 00:19:53.559 align:middle line:84%
and I love this stuff, I
mean it's great to snack

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:58.164 align:middle line:84%
on because it's raw, it's vegan,
it's gluten-free and what it has

00:19:58.164 --> 00:20:00.333 align:middle line:84%
in it is it has organic
date paste,

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:04.737 align:middle line:84%
it has organic cacao power
it has organic chia seed

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:05.705 align:middle line:90%
which Mike was talking about.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:08.174 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you the
health benefits

00:20:08.174 --> 00:20:10.777 align:middle line:90%
of the chia seed are amazing.

00:20:10.777 --> 00:20:16.282 align:middle line:84%
It got organic goji powder, goji
is a really powerful antioxidant

00:20:16.282 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's a wonderful addition
to any types of superfood drink.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.556 align:middle line:84%
It's got organic maca
powder which is good

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.425 align:middle line:90%
for regulating hormone level.

00:20:25.425 --> 00:20:30.997 align:middle line:84%
It's good for women and men
it's got organic lucuma powder,

00:20:30.997 --> 00:20:32.699 align:middle line:90%
organic camu cumu powder

00:20:32.699 --> 00:20:35.468 align:middle line:84%
which is what they extract the
high levels of vitamin C from.

00:20:35.468 --> 00:20:39.005 align:middle line:84%
It's got natural
chocolate flavor

00:20:39.005 --> 00:20:42.108 align:middle line:84%
and it is wheat,
egg, soy, dairy-free.

00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's about as
pure as you can get.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:48.247 align:middle line:84%
It's got high levels of Omega
fatty acids dietary fiber.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.883 align:middle line:90%
No refined sugar either

00:20:50.883 --> 00:20:53.252 align:middle line:84%
>>Mike: Wow, it won't
fit for the breakfast

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:55.688 align:middle line:84%
of most American
kid [inaudible].

00:20:55.688 --> 00:20:56.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I know, huh?

00:20:56.889 --> 00:20:59.726 align:middle line:84%
I mean I have parents that
tell me their kids eat

00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:01.861 align:middle line:84%
like have Kool-Aid
for breakfast--

00:21:01.861 --> 00:21:02.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, man.

00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- and
you know soft drinks.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.164 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It's crazy

00:21:05.164 --> 00:21:06.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Now these come
in little bit-sized chunks.

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:09.135 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to put like one,

00:21:09.135 --> 00:21:15.408 align:middle line:84%
two like three you know some of
them are a little bit bigger.

00:21:15.408 --> 00:21:18.144 align:middle line:84%
So let me put about
that many in there.

00:21:18.144 --> 00:21:19.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: This is starting
to look interesting Ed.

00:21:19.812 --> 00:21:22.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So now I'm going
to take the lid to the blender

00:21:22.315 --> 00:21:25.251 align:middle line:84%
because if you ever turn a
blender on without lid on it,

00:21:25.251 --> 00:21:26.686 align:middle line:84%
you're going mess up
your kitchen pretty bad.

00:21:26.686 --> 00:21:28.021 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: We should
try that sometimes.

00:21:28.021 --> 00:21:37.096 align:middle line:90%
[ Noise ]

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:42.168 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be more men.

00:21:42.168 --> 00:21:43.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: No it's good.

00:21:43.002 --> 00:21:44.003 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: You think it's good?

00:21:44.003 --> 00:21:45.471 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: And viola.

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:51.811 align:middle line:84%
We have the quick and
easy superfood recipe.

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:52.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:21:52.912 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Try it out Mike.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: OK.

00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm really interested
in this one.

00:21:58.785 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Never had this combo before.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.524 align:middle line:84%
It smells good I can smell
the cinnamon already.

00:22:04.524 --> 00:22:06.492 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:08.428 --> 00:22:12.398 align:middle line:84%
Wow, wow, It's great for
the morning it wakes you

00:22:12.398 --> 00:22:13.666 align:middle line:90%
up immediately.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.001 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Plus you can
kind of feel it you know,

00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
coming into your
body as it goes down.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's really good.

00:22:19.105 --> 00:22:20.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: But you
know that you know a lot

00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:23.042 align:middle line:84%
of parents have a
problem you know

00:22:23.042 --> 00:22:25.411 align:middle line:84%
when they send their kids
off to school and everything.

00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:26.779 align:middle line:84%
They're always was
like trying to figure

00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:29.682 align:middle line:84%
out what can I give my kids
that's health on the morning.

00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:32.051 align:middle line:84%
What can I give my husband
that's healthy on the morning?

00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:34.787 align:middle line:84%
What can I give my wife
that's healthy in the morning?

00:22:34.787 --> 00:22:36.856 align:middle line:84%
You know all these
recipes that we're talking

00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:39.192 align:middle line:84%
about today are like
extreme health.

00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:41.828 align:middle line:84%
I mean this isn't like
just piece of fruit

00:22:41.828 --> 00:22:42.995 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:45.398 align:middle line:84%
I mean we're really
covering a broad spectrum

00:22:45.398 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:84%
of all the nutrients
that you're going to need

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.236 align:middle line:90%
like literally superfoods.

00:22:50.236 --> 00:22:51.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Plus if you
make it taste as good

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:54.207 align:middle line:84%
as all these recipes are
tasting, you know, a lot of you

00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:58.978 align:middle line:84%
out there how are wives and your
husbands don't want healthy food

00:22:58.978 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:84%
you know there a lot of
resistance out there the

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.349 align:middle line:84%
in the male population
for some reason.

00:23:03.349 --> 00:23:05.051 align:middle line:90%
And if you give them something

00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:08.321 align:middle line:84%
that taste good they'll drink
it you know they'll love it.

00:23:08.321 --> 00:23:11.457 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to be
health inadvertently.

00:23:11.457 --> 00:23:13.759 align:middle line:84%
From drinking the superfood
and that's the good thing.

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:15.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yes and
another big powerful drink

00:23:15.828 --> 00:23:16.996 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
show you guys how

00:23:16.996 --> 00:23:20.833 align:middle line:84%
to make next brain
power and energy power.

00:23:20.833 --> 00:23:23.503 align:middle line:84%
That's some thing that I
think everybody could use

00:23:23.503 --> 00:23:24.871 align:middle line:84%
when they wake up
in the morning.

00:23:24.871 --> 00:23:26.706 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:23:28.608 --> 00:23:32.678 align:middle line:84%
So now Mike I like to show
everybody what I make just

00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:34.914 align:middle line:84%
for that extra boost
of brain power.

00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:36.782 align:middle line:84%
You know if you have important
meetings in the morning

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:40.419 align:middle line:84%
or something or if you just
need get that boost of energy

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:42.922 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want to drink
coffee or tea or anything

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:90%
or put caffeine in your system.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.326 align:middle line:84%
This is a great energy
boosting drink.

00:23:47.326 --> 00:23:51.264 align:middle line:84%
And not only that it really,
truly helps your mental power.

00:23:51.264 --> 00:23:52.398 align:middle line:90%
And what's great again,

00:23:52.398 --> 00:23:53.766 align:middle line:84%
I know we've been
talking a lot about kids.

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:55.101 align:middle line:90%
But you know when kids are

00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:58.938 align:middle line:84%
in school I've definitely seen
a difference with my kids.

00:23:58.938 --> 00:24:02.408 align:middle line:84%
Because you know why not
stimulate their memory before

00:24:02.408 --> 00:24:03.209 align:middle line:90%
they go to school.

00:24:03.209 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: I can only imagine,

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean you've got coconut
oil here this is proven

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.915 align:middle line:90%
to boost brain function even

00:24:08.915 --> 00:24:10.750 align:middle line:84%
to prevent Alzheimer's
and dementia.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.353 align:middle line:84%
If you have blue berries which
have all kinds of phytonutrients

00:24:14.353 --> 00:24:15.821 align:middle line:84%
and chemicals and the
natural chemicals.

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.723 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
plant-based chemicals

00:24:17.723 --> 00:24:20.126 align:middle line:84%
that protect brain
function, protect neurology,

00:24:20.126 --> 00:24:22.795 align:middle line:84%
and eyes nervous
system protectors,

00:24:22.795 --> 00:24:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and then you've got
this ginseng potion.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:25.731 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely yeah.

00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:27.266 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Potion magic
ginseng potion.

00:24:27.266 --> 00:24:30.536 align:middle line:84%
I can only imagine was in that
it looks really powerful to me.

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:31.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: All right
well lets get started here.

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:33.172 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going

00:24:33.172 --> 00:24:36.742 align:middle line:84%
to use the same thing I used
in my last smoothie recipe.

00:24:36.742 --> 00:24:39.879 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be the
chocolate superpower Warrior

00:24:39.879 --> 00:24:41.214 align:middle line:90%
Food Extreme.

00:24:41.214 --> 00:24:43.849 align:middle line:84%
Now you know we went over
all the ingredients and that,

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:46.152 align:middle line:84%
so I don't think I need
to go over those again.

00:24:46.152 --> 00:24:48.955 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to start
by putting one scoop

00:24:48.955 --> 00:24:55.494 align:middle line:84%
or about one spoon full
in here just like that.

00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Now how does the blue
berries work with the chocolate?

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.066 align:middle line:84%
That's a question that
I'm having right now

00:25:00.066 --> 00:25:02.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well you know
here's the thing I'm kind

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:05.171 align:middle line:84%
offsetting that a
little bit with the salt

00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:06.539 align:middle line:90%
in the sunflower seed.

00:25:06.539 --> 00:25:09.041 align:middle line:84%
It has a kind of distinctive
taste to it you'll see

00:25:09.041 --> 00:25:10.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: OK

00:25:10.409 --> 00:25:12.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Now these are
just organic freeze-dried blue

00:25:12.478 --> 00:25:15.481 align:middle line:84%
berries, because right now, the
blue berries aren't in season

00:25:15.481 --> 00:25:19.218 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't able to
find fresh organic.

00:25:19.218 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Now let's try to get local too.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.921 align:middle line:90%
So I put some blue berries

00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:26.092 align:middle line:84%
in there some freeze-dried
blue berries.

00:25:26.092 --> 00:25:27.526 align:middle line:90%
Now we talked about honey.

00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:28.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, yes.

00:25:28.894 --> 00:25:30.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean you know
honey is just a really good

00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:90%
energy booster.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:36.769 align:middle line:84%
And I always recommend every
gets locally harvested honey.

00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:40.039 align:middle line:84%
Because that way the bees
have lived in your environment

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:43.743 align:middle line:84%
and they actually produce
all the stuff that you need.

00:25:43.743 --> 00:25:46.612 align:middle line:84%
You know don't get honey from
out way across the world.

00:25:46.612 --> 00:25:51.484 align:middle line:84%
Honey actually is an amazing
food because it's the only food

00:25:51.484 --> 00:25:55.021 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't ever go bad and the
reason why it contains a special

00:25:55.021 --> 00:25:57.823 align:middle line:90%
enzyme called glucose oxidase.

00:25:57.823 --> 00:25:58.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: And so also I've heard

00:25:58.891 --> 00:26:00.292 align:middle line:84%
that if you eat local
honey you're going

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:03.162 align:middle line:84%
to more resistant
to local allergens.

00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:03.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: That's right

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:05.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That you could--

00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:08.467 align:middle line:84%
from a Western perspective you
could describe honey as a kind

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:10.903 align:middle line:90%
of a vaccine against allergies.

00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:12.605 align:middle line:84%
Although I don't want
to use the term vaccine

00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:15.541 align:middle line:84%
but just using Western
terminology that's how you might

00:26:15.541 --> 00:26:16.575 align:middle line:90%
describe it.

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:18.844 align:middle line:84%
Some I'm just going
to put some honey

00:26:18.844 --> 00:26:20.446 align:middle line:90%
in there and click in there.

00:26:20.446 --> 00:26:22.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It's going
to be delicious

00:26:22.081 --> 00:26:22.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: All right.

00:26:22.782 --> 00:26:23.883 align:middle line:90%
And then coconut oil--

00:26:23.883 --> 00:26:25.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh yeah.

00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:26.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- you
mentioned how good that is

00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:27.887 align:middle line:84%
for the brain I mean
I've have had people

00:26:27.887 --> 00:26:31.323 align:middle line:84%
that have contacted my office
with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's

00:26:31.323 --> 00:26:35.828 align:middle line:84%
and they've taken-- showed
significant reduction

00:26:35.828 --> 00:26:39.365 align:middle line:84%
in dementia by taking coconut
oil and the improvement

00:26:39.365 --> 00:26:41.434 align:middle line:90%
of the symptoms as well.

00:26:41.434 --> 00:26:44.637 align:middle line:84%
It's a medium chain
triglyceride,

00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:46.872 align:middle line:84%
which you don't really find
too many of those out there.

00:26:46.872 --> 00:26:49.341 align:middle line:84%
Coconut oil is just
an amazing thing.

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:52.011 align:middle line:84%
So I'll put a scoop of
that coconut oil in there.

00:26:52.011 --> 00:26:57.349 align:middle line:84%
And by the way folks this is a
virgin unrefined coconut oil,

00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:58.451 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:26:58.451 --> 00:26:59.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I'm glad you
mention that, yeah.

00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:01.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And so coconut
oil when it's unrefined

00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:04.457 align:middle line:84%
and virgin is actually a
solid at room temperature.

00:27:04.457 --> 00:27:06.926 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one that you're
going to want to go with.

00:27:06.926 --> 00:27:10.062 align:middle line:84%
The next ingredient that
I add is sunflower seeds.

00:27:10.062 --> 00:27:15.067 align:middle line:84%
Now what I love about organic
sprouted sunflower seeds is

00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:18.137 align:middle line:84%
that they're very high
in zinc and you know

00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:21.707 align:middle line:84%
with clinical practice I've had
you know consulted thousands

00:27:21.707 --> 00:27:23.008 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of patients.

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:26.212 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you zinc, iodine
those are two deficiencies

00:27:26.212 --> 00:27:27.813 align:middle line:84%
that you see a lot if
you have white spots

00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:30.316 align:middle line:84%
on you finger nails you
know all kinds of things.

00:27:30.316 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Sunflower seeds zinc
is also very effective

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.491 align:middle line:84%
for the immune system as well,
keep your immune system strong.

00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:90%
And another thing vitamin E,

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.397 align:middle line:84%
high levels of vitamin
E in sun flower seeds.

00:27:44.397 --> 00:27:47.333 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead and add
some sunflower seed in here.

00:27:47.333 --> 00:27:49.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I like how all
these nutrients are natural

00:27:49.502 --> 00:27:52.404 align:middle line:84%
plant-based nutrients
they're in their raw form.

00:27:52.404 --> 00:27:53.806 align:middle line:84%
It's not like your
taking a vitamin

00:27:53.806 --> 00:27:56.509 align:middle line:84%
and getting some isolated form
of vitamin E that's different

00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:57.676 align:middle line:90%
from the natural form.

00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.779 align:middle line:84%
These is a vitamin
E as nature grows

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:04.450 align:middle line:84%
as in the seeds non-GMO
seeds you know no pesticides,

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:07.153 align:middle line:84%
not pasteurized, not
fumigated, irradiated,

00:28:07.153 --> 00:28:09.355 align:middle line:84%
nothing it's just
real nutrition.

00:28:09.355 --> 00:28:13.225 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Also magnesium
and iron are in sunflower seeds.

00:28:13.225 --> 00:28:15.194 align:middle line:84%
So now that we have all
these in there I want

00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:18.864 align:middle line:84%
to add what I thinks
is the best product

00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:90%
for energy which is ginseng.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.803 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm using a product
called Ginseng Fusion

00:28:23.803 --> 00:28:29.375 align:middle line:84%
which is six different forms
of ginseng all added together.

00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:31.644 align:middle line:90%
Ginseng is an adaptogenic herb.

00:28:31.644 --> 00:28:34.079 align:middle line:84%
And what it's going to
do is just balance all

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
of your energy systems
out in your body

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.919 align:middle line:90%
and it gives you a strong boost.

00:28:39.919 --> 00:28:45.157 align:middle line:84%
And what I usually do is put
about four dropper fulls in.

00:28:45.157 --> 00:28:46.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, wow.

00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:48.994 align:middle line:84%
This is seriously kind
of a brain booster.

00:28:48.994 --> 00:28:51.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah, this is some
serious brain power right here.

00:28:51.797 --> 00:28:53.999 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to put
the top on and we're going

00:28:53.999 --> 00:28:56.468 align:middle line:90%
to blend this baby up.

00:28:56.468 --> 00:29:05.544 align:middle line:90%

All right lets see how we go.

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:13.719 align:middle line:90%
And nice purple color there.

00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:15.087 align:middle line:90%
