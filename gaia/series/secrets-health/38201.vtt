00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:32.666 align:middle line:84%
I'm Mike Adams from
naturalnews.com.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Edward Group:
And I'm Ed Group

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.068 align:middle line:90%

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Today's
episode is all about how

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.706 align:middle line:90%
to detox your body naturally.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:43.343 align:middle line:84%
And Ed, you're an expert
on natural detoxification,

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:46.513 align:middle line:84%
you've been in this
realm for 20 years plus.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.081 align:middle line:84%
You've helped formulate
products.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.417 align:middle line:84%
You helped millions
of people detox.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:53.753 align:middle line:84%
In your view, what are the
most important takeaway items

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:56.223 align:middle line:84%
that people need to keep in
mind as they watch the show

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:90%
and even after the show?

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.026 align:middle line:84%
So, what's really the
core of detoxification

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.828 align:middle line:90%
that people need to know?

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.163 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well,
people need to know first

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:06.333 align:middle line:84%
of all is what they're being
exposed to on a daily basis.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.136 align:middle line:90%
I mean it took me like 15 years

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:12.205 align:middle line:84%
to really trace back
what the cause

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:14.207 align:middle line:84%
of all these health
problems are.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.409 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've done
a lot of that too but--

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- you know, when
I started looking around even

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.648 align:middle line:84%
in medical doctors,
chiropractors, you know,

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.818 align:middle line:84%
all the schools that are
out there, they still teach,

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:27.254 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're going to
treat the symptoms instead

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.488 align:middle line:90%
of the root cause.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
My main thing was just find
out what the root causes

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.394 align:middle line:84%
because I know everybody has a
self-healing mechanism inside

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:35.729 align:middle line:90%
their body just like you.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.732 align:middle line:84%
We would have people walk in
with 30, 40, 50 supplements

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.103 align:middle line:84%
in a bag, into my clinic and I
would go through them and say,

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:84%
you know, some of these are good
and some of them aren't good.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.076 align:middle line:84%
But what you're doing is even
if you're putting good nutrition

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:51.444 align:middle line:90%
or good supplements in the body,

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't taken
two steps back--

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.449 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- and
cleanse the body first,

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.151 align:middle line:84%
then it's really not
going to work that good.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, it's
a really good point.

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:04.157 align:middle line:84%
And even people who are into
nutrition and supplementation,

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
you can't see these toxins
that we're talking about.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.261 align:middle line:84%
They're invisible to
the naked eye, right?

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:12.132 align:middle line:84%
So, you can't see a lead
in a calcium supplement.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.901 align:middle line:84%
And there are calcium
supplements, the cheap ones

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:90%
that are contaminated with lead.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
There are, you know, cheap
vitamins that contain chemicals.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.508 align:middle line:90%
There's cheap food.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:23.643 align:middle line:84%
There's even so-called
natural food that's loaded

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.879 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of chemicals,
pesticides, you know,

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.315 align:middle line:90%
residues, maybe even PCBs.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.784 align:middle line:84%
So, these were all invisible
things and I think a lot

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:33.052 align:middle line:84%
of people, they think
that if they can't see it,

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.621 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't exist.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.656 align:middle line:84%
So, they don't realize
they're taking all those in.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And then their health symptoms
are big mystery to them.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.562 align:middle line:84%
So, I think really what
you and I are trying

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:84%
to establish here today for the
audience is cause-effect change.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.139 align:middle line:84%
What inputs of toxins and heavy
metals is causing these symptoms

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.176 align:middle line:84%
and then how do you get
rid of those causes.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.613 align:middle line:84%
The symptoms will vanish
when you eliminate the cause.

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.816 align:middle line:84%
And just like when I had
patients walk in to the office

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.885 align:middle line:84%
and they had diabetes
or they had cancer

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:06.486 align:middle line:90%
or they had heart disease.

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:09.055 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I would
ask them is can you explain

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:84%
to me why you have
heart disease?

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.858 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you have cancer.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:12.692 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Oh, you ask
them if they cancer.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.393 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I ask them that.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.794 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's good.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:15.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And the answer I
got back all the time was no.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.264 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain why I have it.

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:19.799 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, well, you've
already been to five or six

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.635 align:middle line:90%
or seven different doctors.

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Did they explain to you
why you have your disease?

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.071 align:middle line:90%
And they would say no.

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:26.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Wow.

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:27.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And so, I
would say, look, I don't--

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:28.708 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an electrician.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.244 align:middle line:84%
If I need to rewire my
house, I'm not going

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
to rewire my house unless I
first learn about electricity.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.148 align:middle line:90%
So, I would say--

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:36.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.684 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- if you want
to eliminate your cancer

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.686 align:middle line:84%
or your heart disease,
don't you think you have

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:42.622 align:middle line:84%
to understand why you
have heart disease?

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.858 align:middle line:90%
Why you have cancer?

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, because that the medical
establishment teaches us

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.262 align:middle line:84%
that these things are
a matter of bad luck.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:51.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It's
like getting struck

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.033 align:middle line:84%
by an evil lightning
or something.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.567 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden, you know,

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.469 align:middle line:84%
they say you're healthy,
healthy, healthy.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.738 align:middle line:84%
Boom, one day you get
a cancer diagnosis.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:01.675 align:middle line:84%
We have a mammography in
it and it shows positive.

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, bad luck, they say.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.711 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't your fault.

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.179 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing you could
have done or it's the fault

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.882 align:middle line:84%
of your genes, another
medical myth.

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:12.652 align:middle line:84%
In truth, for something to be
detectable as a cancer tumor,

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:16.523 align:middle line:84%
it has to have been growing
for a decade or more just

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:18.658 align:middle line:90%
to show up on mammography.

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:22.295 align:middle line:84%
So, your body has-- You
have created a system

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:25.098 align:middle line:84%
that promotes the growth
of cancer or the growth

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:29.436 align:middle line:84%
of diabetes physiology or heart
disease physiology whatever the

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:30.804 align:middle line:90%
case maybe.

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:33.707 align:middle line:84%
You have in advertently-- I'm
not blaming the patient here

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:36.443 align:middle line:84%
because in many cases, they're
victims of this invisible poison

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.677 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to talk about.

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:41.414 align:middle line:84%
But they have-- their bodies
have become environments

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:46.419 align:middle line:84%
that promote these things
unknown to them, these diseases.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.489 align:middle line:84%
It's all-- It's all stems
from a toxic environment

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:52.659 align:middle line:84%
and that's the research that
I did was like let's figure

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.428 align:middle line:84%
out why these diseases
are happening.

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:56.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:57.397 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So let's
say somebody takes

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:58.932 align:middle line:90%
in a million toxins everyday.

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:01.768 align:middle line:84%
They take in 200,000 toxins
from the air they breathe.

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:04.304 align:middle line:84%
200,000 toxins from
the water they drink--

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: From water toxins.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.906 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: 200, 000
from-- well, yeah.

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:08.241 align:middle line:84%
I mean we're exposed
to that many--

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.143 align:middle line:90%
the beverages, the parasites,

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.879 align:middle line:84%
the prescription
medications that they're on.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:16.182 align:middle line:84%
When you combine all
these stuff in the system,

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:18.351 align:middle line:84%
then the system starts
breaking down.

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:21.254 align:middle line:84%
But what I wanted to
see was how are we going

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:23.757 align:middle line:84%
to absorb these toxins
in the body?

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:26.393 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're either going
to come in through the skin

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:28.094 align:middle line:84%
or they're going to come
in through the mouth.

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:29.729 align:middle line:84%
You know, the skin
is the largest organ.

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So, you can breathe toxins in
too but most of them get caught

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.169 align:middle line:84%
in the mucus membranes
and end up leaking back

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.203 align:middle line:90%
down into the stomach.

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:38.271 align:middle line:90%
So, in my research--

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:39.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It's
scary as a major vector.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It is a major vector.

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:40.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:41.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yes.

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.042 align:middle line:90%
So, my research was let's see

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:46.479 align:middle line:84%
where these toxins are
entering the body and see

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.449 align:middle line:84%
if we can figure out
a solution to that.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.018 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led
me to the research

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:55.588 align:middle line:84%
of the intestinal lining because
all the food and the beverages

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:58.324 align:middle line:84%
and everything else and
all those toxic compounds,

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:01.694 align:middle line:84%
most of them enter
through the intestines.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:02.929 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That's
a really good point.

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:05.832 align:middle line:84%
It also brings up the issue
of the intestinal flora.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:90%
The microbiology

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.203 align:middle line:84%
in the intestines actually
helps repair damaged

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.438 align:middle line:90%
intestinal tissue.

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:13.973 align:middle line:84%
That was in a new study
that just came out recently.

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:17.177 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the medical industry
gives people antibiotics

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:84%
that kill those populations
causing your gut not to be able

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.881 align:middle line:90%
to repair itself, right?

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And then people eat
a lot of gluten

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.485 align:middle line:84%
and then they get
allergic inflammation

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:28.054 align:middle line:84%
of the intestines plus
the damaged tissue

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.422 align:middle line:90%
that can't be repaired.

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:32.692 align:middle line:84%
That's when they start getting
undigested material leaking

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:34.727 align:middle line:90%
directly into the blood, right?

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:37.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: This is how you
can get rheumatoid arthritis

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:40.767 align:middle line:84%
with undigested uric acid
crystals in the blood.

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:42.368 align:middle line:90%
You can actually get chemicals

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:43.870 align:middle line:84%
that normally wouldn't
be absorbed

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.171 align:middle line:90%
to the intestinal walls.

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:47.474 align:middle line:84%
They can then go right
through and enter your blood.

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:50.009 align:middle line:84%
You can have blood
infections that are fatal.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.778 align:middle line:84%
And this happens with
another kind of superbug

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:53.847 align:middle line:84%
in the hospitals right
now that's killing people

00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
or these intestinal blood
infections or the infections.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.219 align:middle line:84%
It starts in the intestines
and then it goes into the blood

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:01.855 align:middle line:84%
and they're dead because there's
no antibiotics to fight it.

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:03.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly, it would.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.791 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You see that's
the hidden guarded secret

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.125 align:middle line:90%
of the medical community.

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:08.294 align:middle line:84%
And when I walked around and
started talking to doctors,

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:10.096 align:middle line:84%
calling gastroenterologist
on the phone

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.632 align:middle line:84%
and asking them what
is the importance

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:90%
of the intestinal lining?

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.269 align:middle line:84%
And they said that they
were barely taught anything

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.438 align:middle line:84%
in medical school
about the intestines.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.608 align:middle line:84%
I started realizing this
is really the secret

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:24.310 align:middle line:84%
to health 'cause the
epithelial lining

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.412 align:middle line:84%
of the intestines is
the same as the skin.

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:27.447 align:middle line:90%
It's our covering.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Our skin is our intestines
inside out.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yup.

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:33.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And with
the BT toxin blowing holes

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:36.456 align:middle line:84%
in the intestinal lining and all
these compounds being floating

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:40.894 align:middle line:84%
around on the bloodstream causes
a chronic immune response.

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:44.597 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that people
are able to get these toxins

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:47.634 align:middle line:84%
out of their intestines
as fast as they come in--

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:51.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- because people
are walking around constipated

00:07:51.004 --> 00:07:52.438 align:middle line:90%
and I have a couple facts here.

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:53.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: OK.

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:54.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Constipation leads

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:58.878 align:middle line:84%
to around 2.5 million doctor
visits every single year

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:01.414 align:middle line:84%
in hundreds and millions
of dollars.

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Wow.

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Less
than 50 percent

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.986 align:middle line:84%
of the population have
one bowel movement a day.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.388 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
National Institute

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:84%
of Digestive Disorders
lists constipation as less

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.629 align:middle line:84%
than three bowel
movements per week.

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, what?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes, yes.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.766 align:middle line:90%
So, when you take these--

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:21.301 align:middle line:90%
all this toxic buildup

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and it stays inside
the intestinal lining,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.473 align:middle line:84%
it ultimately can leak
through burn holes

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:29.108 align:middle line:90%
and then cause a toxic body.

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:31.477 align:middle line:84%
And then those chemicals
have to be stored somewhere

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:35.614 align:middle line:84%
because the liver is
congested, fatty--

00:08:35.614 --> 00:08:39.051 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing fatty liver in kids
these days, 12 and 13 years old.

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:90%
The liver is overworked.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.655 align:middle line:84%
It can't process
the amount of toxins

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:44.857 align:middle line:84%
that we're bringing
in on a daily basis.

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:47.994 align:middle line:84%
So, the liver is, you know,
working at 30 or 40 percent

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:50.863 align:middle line:84%
and these toxins have to be
stored somewhere in the body.

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:53.232 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take diabetes
for example.

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, the pancreas is
burned out from all the foods,

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.273 align:middle line:84%
all of the sudden, the
body starts storing toxins

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:03.343 align:middle line:84%
around the cells in the pancreas
which the outer Langerhans cells

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:04.911 align:middle line:90%
which produce insulin.

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
The cells can't get
the necessary nutrients

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.415 align:middle line:84%
that they need to
produce insulin.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:12.185 align:middle line:84%
So then, all of a sudden,
the insulin levels go down

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:14.687 align:middle line:84%
and then instead of
addressing the root cause

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.923 align:middle line:84%
which means there's
too many toxins and gum

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:18.591 align:middle line:90%
around the outside of the cell.

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:19.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:20.193 align:middle line:90%
It just gave you insulin.

00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: We give insulin.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:22.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And the
problem is still there.

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:23.997 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Well, exactly.

00:09:23.997 --> 00:09:26.332 align:middle line:84%
It's-- There are so many cases
like that in modern medicine.

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.167 align:middle line:90%
But you just mentioned something

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:84%
that reminding me
of dietary fiber.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.073 align:middle line:84%
Because this is one of the ways
that through food we can grab

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:37.443 align:middle line:84%
on to the dietary toxins and
actually move them through.

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:39.579 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
about constipation.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.247 align:middle line:84%
The reason people
are constipated--

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.249 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are couple
but one of the main run--

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:47.987 align:middle line:84%
ones is that they don't
have enough dietary fiber.

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:51.524 align:middle line:84%
And for example, they're
eating white processed flour,

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:52.725 align:middle line:90%
almost no fiber.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:54.527 align:middle line:84%
They're eating a lot
of meat and cheese.

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:58.164 align:middle line:84%
No fiber. They're drinking
pasteurized juices,

00:09:58.164 --> 00:09:59.832 align:middle line:90%
Coca-Cola, Pepsi, no fiber.

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:03.102 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- there's actually--
I don't recall who it was

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:05.271 align:middle line:84%
but it was someone
who works in the realm

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:90%
of clinical detoxification.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.743 align:middle line:84%
And they said-- It was a
doctor who said, you know,

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:12.645 align:middle line:90%
after studying all the societies

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:15.481 align:middle line:84%
around the world, we
can make a choice.

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:90%
We can either live in a society

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:23.756 align:middle line:84%
that where we produce very
large fibrous stools that float

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:27.894 align:middle line:84%
in the water and
very small hospitals

00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:31.764 align:middle line:84%
or we can have a society where
we have very small stools

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:35.435 align:middle line:84%
that sink in water combined
with very large hospitals.

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:36.736 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That's pretty
much where we are right now.

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:38.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's a direct
inverse correlation.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:39.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean if you eat live,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.609 align:middle line:84%
good food then you have
good bowel movements.

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:45.645 align:middle line:90%
If you eat dead processed food,

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.980 align:middle line:84%
then you have dead
bowel movements.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:49.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And
that's something

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:51.284 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
pay attention to.

00:10:51.284 --> 00:10:52.518 align:middle line:84%
You know and I'll say that's
one of the most important things

00:10:52.518 --> 00:10:55.355 align:middle line:84%
because another real
shocking piece of information

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that I found out
is the appendix.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.195 align:middle line:84%
I mean the appendix is actually
the brain super computer

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:03.329 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:06.332 align:middle line:84%
Not the brain in your
head but the appendix.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:10.336 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's still the medical
profession the only thing

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.171 align:middle line:90%
that they do not know what it is

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:15.074 align:middle line:84%
in the body strangely
enough is the appendix.

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:17.376 align:middle line:84%
And I found Russian
and German research

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
that say the appendix actually
regulates the endocrine system,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.681 align:middle line:90%
the neurological system--

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:22.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Interesting.

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:23.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: -- everything.

00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:24.684 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: I hadn't heard that.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.619 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Why wouldn't the
brain or the super computer

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:29.188 align:middle line:84%
of the body be in
the intestines?

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.323 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: What we know--

00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:31.524 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That's the
first explosive point

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:32.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: -- there's a
second brain is your gut.

00:11:32.325 --> 00:11:33.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:34.894 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You're stomach
has its own nerve cells.

00:11:34.894 --> 00:11:36.095 align:middle line:90%
It's called the second brain.

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:36.763 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Exactly.

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:37.997 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Right.

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:38.931 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: But that's
interesting about the appendix.

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:41.134 align:middle line:84%
I'd heard that it
was a repository

00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:43.136 align:middle line:90%
for backup probiotics.

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:46.405 align:middle line:84%
In case your major of
intestinal flora got wiped out,

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:49.709 align:middle line:84%
your appendix could re-introduce
those probiotics back

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:90%
into your digestive tract.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well, that and the
appendix helps regulate the pH

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:57.283 align:middle line:84%
levels in the bowel but what
happens is the appendix gets

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:59.952 align:middle line:84%
malfunctioned because
of the chemicals

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:01.521 align:middle line:84%
in the heavy metals
and everything else.

00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:04.557 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like if you need
a clean environment with water

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and two proteins and a calcium
and a magnesium or whatever

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.496 align:middle line:84%
to regulate or to get a proper
signal and you throw chemicals

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:12.465 align:middle line:84%
in that or you throw
GMOs in there

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:14.967 align:middle line:84%
that change the genetic
structure or anything.

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:17.603 align:middle line:84%
Then you can have alterations
and the appendix might not work

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and might, you know, give the
wrong signals to the brain

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.841 align:middle line:84%
or to the gutter
or anything else.

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:22.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:23.676 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:25.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Or get swollen
and what medical, you know,

00:12:25.011 --> 00:12:27.013 align:middle line:84%
what they're going to do is
they're going to yank it up.

00:12:27.013 --> 00:12:28.080 align:middle line:90%
They're going to cut it out.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Of course,
every astronaut has

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.983 align:middle line:84%
to remove before
they go to space.

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:33.452 align:middle line:84%
No wonder, they have so many
health problems afterwards.

00:12:33.452 --> 00:12:35.421 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about avoidance.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:38.457 align:middle line:84%
Because we promised
people this topic.

00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:41.627 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, avoiding
exposure is a key element

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:44.463 align:middle line:84%
in really detoxification
strategy.

00:12:44.463 --> 00:12:46.466 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to
avoid everything even

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:48.301 align:middle line:84%
if you go buy certified
organic food.

00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:50.903 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get some level
of lead, mercury, arsenic,

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
cadmium, aluminum, tin,
and maybe even copper.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.741 align:middle line:84%
A copper is a nutrient
at small levels

00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:57.877 align:middle line:84%
but it becomes toxic
in high levels.

00:12:57.877 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, same thing with
some other elements as well.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.914 align:middle line:90%
Chromium, two different forms.

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:03.416 align:middle line:90%
One form is a nutrient.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.118 align:middle line:84%
The other form hexavalent
is a toxin.

00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:09.288 align:middle line:84%
You know, arsenic has
organic and inorganic forms.

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:12.692 align:middle line:84%
So, it's impossible to
avoid them completely

00:13:12.692 --> 00:13:16.195 align:middle line:84%
which means you got to
have something in your diet

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:18.464 align:middle line:90%
that binds to those metals

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and helps carry it
through your body.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.735 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have a lot
of knowledge in this area

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:90%
so I post the question to you.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well, this took a
long period of time by the way.

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:28.875 align:middle line:90%
It developed in a lot of testing

00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:31.544 align:middle line:84%
but what we found
was we always start

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:32.945 align:middle line:90%
with the intestinal lining.

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:35.648 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of products
out there that are herbal-based

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.617 align:middle line:84%
that contains psyllium
or cascara sagrada

00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:41.254 align:middle line:84%
or marshmallow root or
senna and things like that.

00:13:41.254 --> 00:13:44.156 align:middle line:84%
But our whole philosophy
is that you need

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.992 align:middle line:84%
to cleanse the bowel
on a regular basis.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.827 align:middle line:84%
I mean people take a
shower every single day,

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.562 align:middle line:90%
wash the outside of their skin.

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.631 align:middle line:84%
They don't wash the
inside of their skin.

00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:54.133 align:middle line:84%
And really when that stuff
sits inside the system

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:57.136 align:middle line:84%
for a long period of time is
when you start having problems.

00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:58.571 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the colons.

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:01.674 align:middle line:84%
See, we've come to a
society of marketing

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:04.744 align:middle line:84%
and then you hear colon
cleansing, colon cleansing.

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:05.878 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:07.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You only
have 10 feet of colon.

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:08.648 align:middle line:84%
By the time everything
gets in the colon anyway,

00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:10.383 align:middle line:84%
it's already formed then
everything's pretty much all

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:12.184 align:middle line:90%
ready extracted from it.

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
The problem is in the
small intestines really.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.523 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, you know,
what works best for me

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:20.593 align:middle line:84%
and what works best for people
I think is a real strong

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:23.296 align:middle line:84%
oxygen-based intestinal
cleanser.

00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:25.665 align:middle line:84%
Because it's something you
could use on a regular basis

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:28.601 align:middle line:84%
and the oxygen actually
bubbles through

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:33.806 align:middle line:84%
and neutralizes the toxic
compound, turns it into an oil,

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:36.609 align:middle line:90%
turns it into a gas or a liquid.

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:39.679 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, it bubbles
through everything,

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.113 align:middle line:90%
turns it into a gas or a liquid.

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:42.181 align:middle line:90%
It's not diarrhea.

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.317 align:middle line:84%
It's actually all
the toxins coming out

00:14:44.317 --> 00:14:45.918 align:middle line:84%
and addresses the
small intestine.

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:48.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing
that we do with everybody

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing I recommend,
keeping the intestines clean

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.528 align:middle line:84%
on a regular basis and doing
that at least two times a week.

00:14:55.528 --> 00:14:57.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I know you've
got a product.

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:59.765 align:middle line:84%
Your store-- Your company has
a product called Oxy-Powder

00:14:59.765 --> 00:15:01.334 align:middle line:90%
that it comes as just that.

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:03.769 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a fan of your product
but let me add something else,

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:08.074 align:middle line:90%
a different product, Ascorbate.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:10.476 align:middle line:84%
It's a vitamin C
that's buffered.

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:12.645 align:middle line:84%
And it's not from
GMO corn, right?

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:16.349 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a non-GMO vitamin
C and it is buffered

00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:17.817 align:middle line:90%
with potassium or magnesium.

00:15:17.817 --> 00:15:20.586 align:middle line:84%
So, it's usually a potassium
ascorbate or magnesium ascorbate

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.555 align:middle line:90%
or other basic minerals.

00:15:22.555 --> 00:15:26.025 align:middle line:84%
There's a great way to get an
intestinal flush with this.

00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:29.261 align:middle line:84%
You take a tablespoon of this
vitamin C every 15 minutes

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:32.932 align:middle line:84%
with some water until
you get a flush.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.767 align:middle line:90%
Now, again, it's not diarrhea,

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.635 align:middle line:84%
although some people
might mistake it for that.

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:40.272 align:middle line:84%
What it is, it's like an
internal intestinal shower.

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:44.043 align:middle line:84%
Your body actually injects
massive amounts of water

00:15:44.043 --> 00:15:47.580 align:middle line:84%
into your intestines as you're
taking in all these vitamin C

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.816 align:middle line:84%
which by the way opens up all
of these detoxification pathways

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
at a cellular level, boost
your glutathione production

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.454 align:middle line:90%
and efficiency.

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:58.724 align:middle line:84%
Helps remove mercury
from cells at the same

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:01.794 align:middle line:84%
that you're flushing your toxins
out through your small intestine

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.863 align:middle line:90%
and large intestine and colon.

00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:05.698 align:middle line:84%
So, there's another--
There's another example.

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:06.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: No, and
I agree with that.

00:16:06.832 --> 00:16:08.134 align:middle line:90%
And another great example

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:11.637 align:middle line:84%
and this goes back past
biblical times is fasting.

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.539 align:middle line:84%
I mean we've lost
the ability to fast.

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:16.909 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think people fasted
for so, so many years ago?

00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:18.811 align:middle line:84%
They would fast one day
a week, two days a week

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
or maybe every couple of
months they would fast and back

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.216 align:middle line:84%
in those days might, Mike, they
didn't even have chemicals.

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:26.118 align:middle line:84%
They only had was
pure organic food

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:90%
and they were still fasting.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:27.953 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:29.055 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:16:29.055 --> 00:16:29.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: They were
their body a chance

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.157 align:middle line:90%
to heal itself, you know.

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then, I'll go
on a complete raw juice fast

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.529 align:middle line:84%
for like a week or a
water fast for a few days.

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:40.733 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to help
detoxify the intestinal tract.

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:43.335 align:middle line:84%
And once the intestines are
clean then you can start

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:46.038 align:middle line:84%
detoxifying other
areas of the body

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:49.742 align:middle line:84%
which the liver is
a major organ.

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.644 align:middle line:84%
It's the second largest
organ and it needs

00:16:51.644 --> 00:16:54.046 align:middle line:84%
to be cleansed on
a regular basis.

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:56.949 align:middle line:84%
Just think-- People
ask me, you know,

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:59.852 align:middle line:84%
heart disease is a major killer
in America and they ask me

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.454 align:middle line:84%
about blood pressure
all the time.

00:17:01.454 --> 00:17:04.256 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look, did
your doctor tell you

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:07.026 align:middle line:84%
that blood pressure is
caused by a congested liver?

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Just think if you
had an oil filter

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.564 align:middle line:84%
on your car then you
never change, OK?

00:17:11.564 --> 00:17:12.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:13.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: How-- Well,
the oil pump would burn

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:16.735 align:middle line:84%
out because it would even
be able to pump the oil

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:18.137 align:middle line:90%
through the filter anymore.

00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:19.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's right.

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And the liver is
your major detoxification organ.

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:25.443 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's what takes and
detoxifies all the chemicals

00:17:25.443 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and all the compounds
and pushes them back

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.749 align:middle line:84%
in so you can eliminate
them properly.

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:33.686 align:middle line:84%
Well, if your liver is
fatty which we're seeing

00:17:33.686 --> 00:17:35.988 align:middle line:84%
in the majority of
people over the age of 30,

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:39.692 align:middle line:84%
if it's congested, the
blood from the heart--

00:17:39.692 --> 00:17:42.862 align:middle line:84%
The heart tries to pump
and it can't pump the blood

00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:44.897 align:middle line:84%
through the liver
so it's congested

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:47.166 align:middle line:84%
and of course the heart is
going to have to be faster

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:50.202 align:middle line:84%
and stronger and its going
to have to try to pressure

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:52.037 align:middle line:84%
that through the liver
and then you're going

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:53.172 align:middle line:90%
to have high blood pressure.

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:57.543 align:middle line:84%
So, instead of the
doctor saying, Mrs. Jones,

00:17:57.543 --> 00:18:00.012 align:middle line:84%
you have high blood pressure
because you have a toxic liver.

00:18:00.012 --> 00:18:01.514 align:middle line:90%
It's always simplicity, Mike--

00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:02.748 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: I know, I know.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:03.783 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- I mean
it's here in you right there

00:18:03.783 --> 00:18:04.717 align:middle line:84%
in the face that's
just basic anatomy.

00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:05.217 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: No.

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:06.418 align:middle line:90%
They say--

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.486 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: They put
you on high blood pressure

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:08.721 align:middle line:84%
which causes more
toxicity to the liver.

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:11.257 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Oh, exactly,
the medications.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.792 align:middle line:84%
Yeah or they say
it's because of salt.

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:14.827 align:middle line:84%
And let's also talk about the
kidneys because the kidney--

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:15.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:16.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: -- is our key

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:84%
for eliminating toxins
in your blood.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.033 align:middle line:84%
And of course, kidneys right now
are being damaged in a big way

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:23.803 align:middle line:84%
by two things that a lot of
people don't know about it.

00:18:23.803 --> 00:18:25.304 align:middle line:90%
One is vaccines.

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:28.974 align:middle line:84%
You know that mercury in
vaccines causes kidney damage

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's permanent
damage, unlike the liver

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.179 align:middle line:84%
which can repair itself
quite effectively.

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:90%
You know, it can grow back--

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:35.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: -- if you
take half of it out.

00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:37.183 align:middle line:90%
They can still grow back.

00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:38.284 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Your liver
regenerates every 90 days.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.118 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.319 align:middle line:90%
But the kidneys don't, right?

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:42.655 align:middle line:84%
You damage renal function
and it stays damaged.

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:45.291 align:middle line:84%
So, dialysis centers
across the country

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and around the world are
experiencing booming business

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.564 align:middle line:84%
because of vaccinations
that contain mercury.

00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:53.999 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they can actually
just have vaccines

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:56.268 align:middle line:84%
that didn't have
mercury in them,

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:58.103 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be against
them so much.

00:18:58.103 --> 00:19:00.673 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't, you know, I mean
I still wouldn't get them

00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:03.843 align:middle line:84%
but at least they wouldn't be
damaging people from the mercury

00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:05.844 align:middle line:90%
but there's also cadmium.

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:06.478 align:middle line:90%
Cadmium.

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:07.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:08.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: We found it in
our laboratory testing

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.816 align:middle line:84%
at the Natural News
Forensic Food lab.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:14.053 align:middle line:84%
We found 3,000 parts
per billion of cadmium

00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:16.088 align:middle line:90%
in organic brown rice.

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:19.358 align:middle line:84%
Certified organic, UST
organic brown rice.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.693 align:middle line:90%
This cadmium in addition

00:19:20.693 --> 00:19:25.464 align:middle line:84%
to being a hormone mimicker
just a xenoestrogen just

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:29.501 align:middle line:84%
like BPA also causes
permanent kidney damage.

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:32.705 align:middle line:84%
So, you can imagine and
if you combine vaccines

00:19:32.705 --> 00:19:35.808 align:middle line:84%
with cadmium that's in the
foods, you don't know it's

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:37.142 align:middle line:90%
in there because it's invisible.

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:38.677 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
kidney damage.

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:40.279 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
liver damage.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.314 align:middle line:84%
You're also going
to get brain damage,

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.483 align:middle line:90%
reduced cognitive function.

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:45.784 align:middle line:90%
And this is I think one

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:49.388 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest issues facing
our civilization today is

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:53.392 align:middle line:84%
that we have a society based
on people who are voters,

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:57.696 align:middle line:84%
who are public speakers, who
make decisions, our teachers,

00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:01.834 align:middle line:84%
school teachers, they
are damaged cognitively

00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:03.469 align:middle line:84%
by these heavy metals
and toxic chemicals

00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:04.436 align:middle line:84%
that are altering
their brain function.

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:06.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely,

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:09.441 align:middle line:84%
100 percent when you
add MSG and aspartame--

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:10.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yup.

00:20:10.843 --> 00:20:11.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- the artificial
sweeteners, they're exotoxins,

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:14.079 align:middle line:84%
and it just causes a
bad chemical reaction.

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:15.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yes.

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:16.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You know,
speaking of the kidney,

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:18.617 align:middle line:84%
I have people talked to me about
kidney stones all the time.

00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:22.154 align:middle line:84%
I mean how damaging is when
your kidney literally starts

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:26.025 align:middle line:84%
calcifying and a good remedy
that I always tell people

00:20:26.025 --> 00:20:29.328 align:middle line:84%
to do is apple cider vinegar
and lemon water with distilled--

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and take the distilled
water, put the juice of four

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.967 align:middle line:84%
or five lemons in a gallon
and just drink that straight.

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:36.635 align:middle line:84%
Although, there are some
other things out there

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:39.605 align:middle line:84%
that you can take but it's
a good easy natural remedy

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:41.006 align:middle line:90%
that they can use.

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:43.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's a great point
and you can do marshmallow root

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:45.944 align:middle line:84%
or corn silk tea
or a lot of things.

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:48.647 align:middle line:84%
But you're right,
altering the pH temporarily

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:51.383 align:middle line:84%
to be more acidic
will actually tend

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:54.253 align:middle line:84%
to dissolve the calcification
deposits in your kidneys

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.355 align:middle line:84%
as your kidneys are
processing your blood

00:20:56.355 --> 00:20:57.856 align:middle line:84%
and removing there
from your body.

00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:59.391 align:middle line:84%
So, you've hit a
part of bigger area.

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:01.927 align:middle line:84%
We don't have time to talk about
this here but everybody talks

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:03.662 align:middle line:90%
about alkalizing, alkalizing.

00:21:03.662 --> 00:21:06.598 align:middle line:84%
Well, overall, it's a great
principle but sometimes

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:09.501 align:middle line:84%
for short periods of
time, you want to acidify

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:11.537 align:middle line:84%
for specific therapeutic
purpose.

00:21:11.537 --> 00:21:12.671 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:13.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And that might
be something that those

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.741 align:middle line:84%
of you watching, you may
want to do that with the help

00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:17.576 align:middle line:90%
of a naturopathic physician,

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:20.879 align:middle line:84%
someone who can really give
you some guidance on that.

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:23.115 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to acidify it
all the time and you don't want

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.216 align:middle line:90%
to alkalize all the time.

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:25.351 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Right.

00:21:25.351 --> 00:21:26.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: We need to know
when to use which one.

00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:28.253 align:middle line:84%
So, that's important
because I see a lot

00:21:28.253 --> 00:21:30.022 align:middle line:84%
of people buying those
alkalizer machines

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:33.425 align:middle line:84%
and just drinking
alkaline water constantly.

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:35.461 align:middle line:84%
That's not good to
do it all the time.

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:36.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: No.

00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:37.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You got to
know when to do it.

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:39.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: In nature and
rainwater, you're not going

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.265 align:middle line:90%
to find that all the time.

00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:41.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: No.

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:43.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean it's, you
know, and I'm a big believer

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:45.738 align:middle line:84%
and you do things the natural
way and you try to be involved

00:21:45.738 --> 00:21:49.007 align:middle line:84%
as much as how it
occurs in nature itself.

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:50.843 align:middle line:84%
And again, you know,
talking about kidney stones,

00:21:50.843 --> 00:21:53.545 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people don't even know
that you have liver stones.

00:21:53.545 --> 00:21:55.681 align:middle line:84%
You have just as many
stones in your liver

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:57.316 align:middle line:90%
as you do your gallbladder.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:22:00.085 align:middle line:84%
There are lot of good
remedies out there for liver

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:01.186 align:middle line:90%
and gallbladder cleansing.

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:02.721 align:middle line:84%
You know, the one
that I have used

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:84%
for a long time is giving
people a liver-cleansing,

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.296 align:middle line:84%
four days preparation to
soften the stones and one

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:14.666 align:middle line:84%
of the best ways to do that
is with a Chanca Piedra

00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and a few different
liver-cleansing herbs,

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.207 align:middle line:84%
making sure they're all organic,
vegan, you know, gluten-free.

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And then utilizing a few
days before drinking a lot

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.713 align:middle line:84%
of water taking those
herbs and then on day five

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:30.983 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see this throughout
the internet is using an olive

00:22:30.983 --> 00:22:32.151 align:middle line:90%
oil mixture.

00:22:32.151 --> 00:22:33.819 align:middle line:84%
They're drinking a
certain amount of olive oil

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.187 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of
purges the liver

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.221 align:middle line:84%
and purges the stone
[inaudible].

00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:37.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: A lot of
olive oil to drink.

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:39.191 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.226 align:middle line:84%
That's the hardest part but
then they also use epsom salts

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:43.429 align:middle line:90%
to loosen everything up as well.

00:22:43.429 --> 00:22:45.964 align:middle line:84%
And that's a pretty popular
liver cleanse out there, a liver

00:22:45.964 --> 00:22:47.599 align:middle line:84%
and gallbladder cleanse
and especially

00:22:47.599 --> 00:22:50.002 align:middle line:84%
if you do not have
a gallbladder,

00:22:50.002 --> 00:22:52.438 align:middle line:84%
it's more the reason why you
need to cleanse your liver

00:22:52.438 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:84%
because your liver will
produce bile to take

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.209 align:middle line:90%
over for your gallbladder.

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.344 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Now, everything you
said is right on the mark.

00:22:59.344 --> 00:23:00.712 align:middle line:90%
I agree with it.

00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:04.283 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about though the
need for a daily strategy.

00:23:04.283 --> 00:23:06.985 align:middle line:84%
You got to detoxify at
some level everyday.

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:10.155 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you just
one example why.

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:12.891 align:middle line:84%
Lead which is in a lot of
foods, it's in lipstick,

00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:15.994 align:middle line:84%
it's in cosmetics, it's
in children's toys,

00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:17.663 align:middle line:90%
it's in Halloween candy.

00:23:17.663 --> 00:23:20.999 align:middle line:84%
Lead tends to go into your
bones because it tends

00:23:20.999 --> 00:23:24.403 align:middle line:84%
to follow the metabolic
pathways of calcium.

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:27.473 align:middle line:84%
So, a lot of people, they
may had lead exposure

00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:30.476 align:middle line:84%
over their lifetimes and maybe
they're 40, 50 years old today.

00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot of lead.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.646 align:middle line:84%
It builds up in their bones
which makes your bones soft

00:23:34.646 --> 00:23:37.916 align:middle line:84%
by the way, contributes to
osteoporosis and lot of women go

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.151 align:middle line:84%
through a menopause
and they begin

00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:84%
to really dissolve some
bones and reform bones.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.657 align:middle line:84%
You know, bones area always
dissolving and reforming just

00:23:45.657 --> 00:23:47.092 align:middle line:84%
like every cell in
your body really.

00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:50.395 align:middle line:84%
Everything is being
recycled and reformed.

00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:52.931 align:middle line:84%
As that happens, especially
after menopause with a lot

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:54.933 align:middle line:90%
of bone materials are released.

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:58.136 align:middle line:84%
You can then get lead
released into your bloodstream.

00:23:58.136 --> 00:23:59.738 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
get lead poisoning

00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:03.709 align:middle line:84%
from your own skeleton
at whatever age.

00:24:03.709 --> 00:24:05.377 align:middle line:90%
You go through that cycle.

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:09.314 align:middle line:84%
So, at that point, you better
have a detoxification system

00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:11.984 align:middle line:84%
going so that you can pull
the lead out to your blood

00:24:11.984 --> 00:24:13.952 align:middle line:84%
which your kidneys
and liver are going

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:15.153 align:middle line:90%
to be responsible for that.

00:24:15.153 --> 00:24:16.889 align:middle line:90%
And get it out to your body.

00:24:16.889 --> 00:24:17.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You
pretty much have

00:24:17.923 --> 00:24:20.025 align:middle line:84%
to detoxify yourself
on a steady basis.

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:20.726 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:24:20.726 --> 00:24:21.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: You really do.

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:22.561 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: -- everything

00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:23.762 align:middle line:84%
that we're exposed
to on a daily basis.

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:26.698 align:middle line:84%
Yes, of course, the first
priority is to make sure

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:29.134 align:middle line:84%
that you eliminate
all the toxins,

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:32.671 align:middle line:84%
clean up your environment, don't
put the chemicals in your body.

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:33.906 align:middle line:90%
But still, that's not enough.

00:24:33.906 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean we're exposed
to them everyday.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.109 align:middle line:84%
You have to do intestinal
cleansing.

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:38.944 align:middle line:84%
You have to do at
least a few liver

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and gallbladder cleansing
at-- cleanses every year.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.282 align:middle line:90%
It's preventative care.

00:24:43.282 --> 00:24:44.516 align:middle line:90%
It's keeping yourself healthy.

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:47.352 align:middle line:84%
You're going to save so
much money in the long run.

00:24:47.352 --> 00:24:50.789 align:middle line:84%
And then also, you know, one of
our big cleansers is a chemical

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:52.758 align:middle line:84%
and heavy metal cleanse
talking about lead,

00:24:52.758 --> 00:24:56.595 align:middle line:84%
talking about mercury, amalgams
in the teeth, all the aluminum

00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:58.664 align:middle line:84%
that we're exposed to,
through the chemtrails

00:24:58.664 --> 00:24:59.831 align:middle line:90%
and through the deodorants

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:03.569 align:middle line:84%
and through aluminum
foil and aluminum cans.

00:25:03.569 --> 00:25:06.204 align:middle line:84%
Listen, in chemical and
heavy metal, I always wait

00:25:06.204 --> 00:25:08.507 align:middle line:84%
until we do the intestinal
cleanse then the liver

00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:10.642 align:middle line:84%
and gallbladder cleansings
'cause I don't want to pull

00:25:10.642 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:84%
out too many chemicals and
heavy metals unless the liver

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.249 align:middle line:84%
and the intestines
are already clean.

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:19.284 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I want to make
an important note on this

00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:22.421 align:middle line:84%
to all those watching that if
you feel like you're suffering

00:25:22.421 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:84%
from some kind of acute
poisoning in metals

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.558 align:middle line:84%
or you have a heavy
load of metals

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:28.427 align:middle line:90%
or other poisons in your body.

00:25:28.427 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I really encourage you to seek
out a professional clinician

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.633 align:middle line:84%
who specializes in
detoxification.

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:35.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:37.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Many of them
are members of ACAM.

00:25:37.169 --> 00:25:40.005 align:middle line:84%
Many of them use EDTA and
other chelation agents.

00:25:40.005 --> 00:25:42.107 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
used intravenously.

00:25:42.107 --> 00:25:43.742 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are oral.

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:46.445 align:middle line:84%
There are other methods to
get them in your body as well

00:25:46.445 --> 00:25:49.881 align:middle line:84%
but the point is that you
can actually damage yourself

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:53.952 align:middle line:84%
with too rapid of
a chelation agent

00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:56.021 align:middle line:84%
or chelation-based
detoxification.

00:25:56.021 --> 00:25:58.857 align:middle line:84%
You can create such a
heavy load of metals coming

00:25:58.857 --> 00:26:01.593 align:middle line:84%
out of your tissues and out
of your organs and your blood.

00:26:01.593 --> 00:26:05.263 align:middle line:84%
That itself can be a problem so
you need to work with someone--

00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I believe if you think you
have a heavy load here,

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.235 align:middle line:84%
work with someone
who understands how

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:12.904 align:middle line:84%
to do this gradually
step by step

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:14.606 align:middle line:84%
so that you can get
it out of your system.

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:16.675 align:middle line:84%
You don't want detox
in one night.

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:17.709 align:middle line:90%
That could kill you.

00:26:17.709 --> 00:26:19.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: No.

00:26:19.044 --> 00:26:20.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You want to detox
step by step in a safe manner

00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:23.715 align:middle line:84%
that restores your health
over time consistently.

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That's a great
point because listen I mean

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.586 align:middle line:84%
if you're detoxing
for the first time.

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:29.521 align:middle line:84%
I mean let's say
you're 50 years old

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:30.922 align:middle line:84%
and you've been exposing
yourself

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:32.824 align:middle line:84%
to all these toxins
for 50 years.

00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:33.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:35.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And then
all of the sudden,

00:26:35.127 --> 00:26:37.329 align:middle line:84%
you decide to go detox, you
know, you could be going

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:38.897 align:middle line:84%
through what's called
a Herxheimer reaction

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:40.298 align:middle line:90%
or a healing crisis.

00:26:40.298 --> 00:26:42.267 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that you
definitely want someone to work

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:44.603 align:middle line:84%
with you on and you want to
take a little bit slower.

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:47.839 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's not going to-- in
most cases kill you or anything

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:49.841 align:middle line:90%
but it's a good idea to work

00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:51.977 align:middle line:84%
with a natural healthcare
practitioner

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:54.246 align:middle line:90%
that can monitor your result.

00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.449 align:middle line:84%
And for example, a lot of
people watching right now grew

00:26:57.449 --> 00:27:00.152 align:middle line:84%
up in the time when there
was leaded gasoline.

00:27:00.152 --> 00:27:00.786 align:middle line:90%
Remember--

00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: -- unleaded
gasoline only kicked

00:27:03.055 --> 00:27:04.990 align:middle line:84%
in about what the late
1970s or the early '80s.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.124 align:middle line:90%
Before that, it was all leaded.

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:09.127 align:middle line:84%
So, you were breathing
in lead and it was going

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:12.097 align:middle line:84%
into your bones all those
years before the switch over.

00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:15.701 align:middle line:84%
So, you've got lead in you from
that source of nothing else.

00:27:15.701 --> 00:27:18.637 align:middle line:84%
There's aluminum in the
air from the chemtrails.

00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:20.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And
another thing too that's--

00:27:20.172 --> 00:27:23.141 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how important
this was but parasites.

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:24.843 align:middle line:90%
See the definition of parasite?

00:27:24.843 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, yeah.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:26.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: People think

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:27.746 align:middle line:84%
when they hear parasite,
it's just a worm.

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:29.815 align:middle line:84%
But a parasite is
anything that lives off

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:32.184 align:middle line:84%
of a host mechanism that's
not supposed to be there

00:27:32.184 --> 00:27:35.754 align:middle line:84%
or it's damaging to the host
mechanism which is bacteria,

00:27:35.754 --> 00:27:39.758 align:middle line:84%
virus, worms, mycoplasms,
who knows all

00:27:39.758 --> 00:27:41.893 align:middle line:84%
of these different things
that we're dealing with today.

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:42.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yes.

00:27:42.728 --> 00:27:43.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: And so, another--

00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:46.031 align:middle line:84%
What happens is we found
cancer patients had

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:49.334 align:middle line:84%
over a hundred trillion
microbes in their body.

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:51.169 align:middle line:90%
Now, when you have in your body.

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:53.672 align:middle line:84%
You now have candida which
is ramping right now,

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:59.311 align:middle line:84%
when you have all these toxic
byproducts of these organisms,

00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:00.378 align:middle line:90%
these harmful organisms.

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:02.914 align:middle line:84%
When they-- They
take your nutrition

00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and then they take
it away from you

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.587 align:middle line:84%
and then what they
secrete isopropyl alcohol,

00:28:08.587 --> 00:28:10.689 align:middle line:90%
formaldehyde, phenols.

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:14.659 align:middle line:84%
They secrete acid-forming
chemicals in your systems.

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:17.529 align:middle line:84%
So, it's very important
to do it.

00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:21.266 align:middle line:84%
Parasite cleanse, you know,
you can use black walnut hull

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:25.270 align:middle line:84%
for that, wormwood,
there's clove you can use.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.638 align:middle line:84%
There's many other
things you can do

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:29.107 align:middle line:84%
but it's I think it's very
important to a parasite cleanse

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:30.442 align:middle line:90%
at least two times a year.

00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:31.843 align:middle line:84%
And you pretty much
have to do it

00:28:31.843 --> 00:28:35.447 align:middle line:84%
for six weeks 'cause that's the
full life cycle of a parasite.

00:28:35.447 --> 00:28:36.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:28:36.148 --> 00:28:37.382 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with you.

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.651 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say that I
think one of the next phases

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:43.989 align:middle line:84%
in modern medicine is
going to be the recognition

00:28:43.989 --> 00:28:46.925 align:middle line:84%
of the importance of
the gut, the importance

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:49.427 align:middle line:84%
of the probiotics,
the healthy bacteria.

00:28:49.427 --> 00:28:51.663 align:middle line:84%
And I think the problem with the
Western medicine which has been

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:54.599 align:middle line:84%
on a reductionist model
and compartmentalization

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:57.702 align:middle line:84%
of the human body is that
they never allowed things

00:28:57.702 --> 00:28:58.904 align:middle line:90%
to be connected.

00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:00.672 align:middle line:84%
The mind wasn't connected
to the body they say.

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:01.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't even believe
in the mind.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.742 align:middle line:84%
Most doctors don't
believe in the mind

00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:90%
or consciousness or anything.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.346 align:middle line:84%
They don't believe that the
gut is connected to the body

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:10.982 align:middle line:84%
or the immune system and
that's a huge mistake.

00:29:10.982 --> 00:29:13.451 align:middle line:84%
We've got to start thinking
holistically, folks.

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
answers come from.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.288 align:middle line:90%
It's all about the holistic.

00:29:16.288 --> 00:29:18.523 align:middle line:84%
It's the mind, it's the
body, it's the spirit,

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:21.326 align:middle line:84%
it's the environment, it's
the microbes in your gut,

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:24.229 align:middle line:84%
it's the food, the water, the
sunshine, all these things come

00:29:24.229 --> 00:29:27.098 align:middle line:84%
in the magnetics of the
planet all come in together.

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.433 align:middle line:90%
This is real holistic health.

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:29.634 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And
the thing is, Mike,

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:32.637 align:middle line:84%
our natural detoxification
methods are closed down.

00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean normally the
way we detoxify is

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.275 align:middle line:84%
to having proper
bowel movements,

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:41.213 align:middle line:84%
through urinating
properly, through respiration

00:29:41.213 --> 00:29:43.415 align:middle line:84%
and diaphoresis which
is sweating.

00:29:43.415 --> 00:29:44.616 align:middle line:90%
Most people are sedentary.

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:46.051 align:middle line:84%
They're not getting
their exercise

00:29:46.051 --> 00:29:50.755 align:middle line:84%
and so our natural elimination
and detoxification pathways

00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:55.994 align:middle line:84%
with congested liver and just
overgrown and over accumulation

00:29:55.994 --> 00:29:59.631 align:middle line:84%
of toxins in the body
suppresses our own ability

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:00.832 align:middle line:90%
to eliminate them.

00:30:00.832 --> 00:30:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you really
need to help these days

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.769 align:middle line:84%
of other compounds, herbal
compounds and methods

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:07.806 align:middle line:84%
like far infrared saunas,
chiropractic cares,

00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:10.508 align:middle line:90%
great, massage, acupuncture.

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:13.545 align:middle line:84%
These are all things that you
can use on a regular basis

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:15.814 align:middle line:90%
to help detoxify your body.

00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:17.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So, I hope you
learned a lot on this episode.

00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:19.517 align:middle line:84%
I know we covered
a lot of topics,

00:30:19.517 --> 00:30:21.686 align:middle line:84%
definitely do some
more research and check

00:30:21.686 --> 00:30:24.289 align:middle line:84%
with your naturopathic physician
if you have more questions.
