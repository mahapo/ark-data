00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.370 align:middle line:10%
MIKE: Welcome to Secrets
to Health with Mike and Ed.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm Mike Adams, the
editor of National News.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:10%
ED: And I'm Dr. Ed Group, the
owner of Global Healing Center.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.420 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: And today,
on this episode,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.330 align:middle line:84%
we're covering how to avoid and
recognize GMOs-- genetically

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:90%
modified organisms.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.781 align:middle line:84%
That's a topic that a lot of
people are interested in, Ed.

00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:90%
ED: I tell you what.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:84%
It's really sweeping
the globe right now.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've had
March Against Monsanto.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think many
people are starting

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:90%
to realize what GMOs are.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, GMOs are genetically
modified organisms.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:84%
How do they actually
create GMOs, Mike?

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.840 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Well, we have a
handy DNA model right here,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:90%
to help show the people.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a not to
scale model of DNA.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But what scientists
do is, they actually

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.660 align:middle line:84%
insert genes of another species
inside the gene of a plant--

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:84%
normally like corn,
or soy, cotton,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:84%
canola, and sugar beets is
another common one, and now

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:90%
alfalfa.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they've been
experimenting with wheat.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And we could talk about
how that pollution

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:84%
happened in Oregon, polluted
the commercial wheat fields.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:90%
But basically, they take a gene.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
They insert it into the
genome, the gene sequence,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:84%
to modify the gene
expression of that plant.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.080 align:middle line:90%
And this is not natural.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't ever
happen in nature.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:84%
What they do is, they're mixing
insect genes with plant genes,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:84%
or insect genes with
mammal genes, sometimes,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:84%
or even soil bacteria
genes with plant genes.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:90%
It's completely unnatural.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It is called Frankenscience
by many people.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:90%
But that's the truth about GMOs.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:84%
ED: And this is a
dangerous, dangerous thing.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and this
is something that

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:84%
is so damaging
that it's literally

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:90%
affecting the world right now.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto-- there's a
couple different companies.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto, Dow AgroSciences,
Syngenta-- all these companies

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
are actually trying to take
control of the food supply.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And what happens to animals
and what happens to people when

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
they eat these
genetically modified

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.470 align:middle line:90%
organisms is their gene change.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're seeing the
bee population now being

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:84%
linked to genetically modified
pollen, which can travel

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:90%
up to 500 miles sometimes.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the
butterfly population.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing damage
to the soils.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So, Mike, what are
the most common

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.447 align:middle line:84%
GMOs that people are
eating every day?

00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: First, let me
speak to your point.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.946 align:middle line:84%
What you're talking
about is called

00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:47.550 align:middle line:90%
transgenic effects of the GMOs.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you take
genetically modified

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
corn, which we have right
here to show you some of it.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:90%
This is GMO corn.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:84%
This is Monsanto's intellectual
property, even though I

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:90%
bought it somewhere else.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Every kernel of
this corn contains

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:90%
a poison that kills insects.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And this poison is
called Bt toxin.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was created by
inserting a soil microbe

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:84%
genetic code into
the corn which is,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:90%
again, completely unnatural.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
But when you eat
that-- you know,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
your body is more
bacteria than human cells.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:84%
You actually, literally,
have more bacteria cells

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:90%
in your body than human cells.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:84%
You are more
bacteria than human,

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:84%
in essence, at a
cellular level, because

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:90%
of the probiotics in your gut.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:10%
Well, the theory is that some
of the genetic code of the corn

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:10%
can then interact with the
genes of your gut bacteria,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:10%
creating a transgenic
phenomenon that then causes

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.120 align:middle line:10%
your bacteria in your own
gut to start producing

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:10%
Bt toxin in your own gut.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Effectively, Ed, you turn
your gut into a poison factory

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:84%
where you begin
producing the insecticide

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and absorbing it
through your gut wall.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:90%
That is toxic.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
ED: That's exactly
what's happening, Mike.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And since GMO foods
were introduced in 1996,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.460 align:middle line:84%
if you look at any
degenerative disease,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:90%
you will see a spike upwards.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:90%
And here's the reason why.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Like you were talking about,
the bacillus thuringiensis

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is the bacteria that
produces the Bt toxin.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:84%
What happens when people
consume corn chips?

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.590 align:middle line:84%
All the stuff in
processed foods,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.130 align:middle line:84%
mostly soy or corn, which--
96% to 98% of all soy

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:90%
is genetically modified.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.174 align:middle line:84%
Even in soybean oil, soy
lecithin, some of the things

00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
talking a little bit

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
about today, when that toxin
gets inside the system,

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:90%
it wreaks havoc.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it has now
been proven to burn holes

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:90%
through the intestinal lining.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Once you burn holes through
the intestinal lining,

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:84%
all the toxins that
you're consuming--

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:84%
all the other toxins in the
food and everything else--

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
end up causing an
immune response.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.050 align:middle line:90%
This is a stomach, right here.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: And this is
roughly to scale.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:90%
ED: This is roughly to scale.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.530 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Unless you've
had bariatric surgery

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.105 align:middle line:84%
and they've taken
most of it out.

00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:10.805 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:11.961 align:middle line:90%
ED: Whoa!

00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: There goes the pancreas.
Sorry about that.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
ED: Well, let's
open up the stomach

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and show that the
stomach actually

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:90%
has parietal cells in there.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
with the Bt toxin,

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
the Bt toxin actually alters
the cells in the stomach.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And not only the stomach, but
when food leaves the stomach it

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:90%
goes into the small intestine.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And a big problem, Mike, also,
is that people aren't chewing

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:90%
their food enough to digest.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
We have natural enzymes in our
mouth, amylase and patulin.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Those are there that we
secrete to help us digest

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:90%
foods and break foods down.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the
normal person swallows

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:84%
their food only after about
10 chews, five to 10 chews--

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: Wofling it down.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.460 align:middle line:84%
ED: --which is large
food particles.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: But back to the GMOs.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
There have been studies now
showing that animals fed

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.920 align:middle line:84%
genetically modified foods
as a significant part

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:84%
of their animal feed
suffered from inflammation

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:90%
of their stomachs.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:10%
And there are other studies--
and you can see the photos

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:10%
we're showing right here, the
Seralini GMO rat study that

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:10%
caused these rats to
grow cancer tumors,

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:10%
huge monstrous tumors,
because they were eating

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:10%
GMOs and Glyphosate,
the chemical that's

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:10%
usually sprayed on GMO crops.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Also in that study, Ed, those
rats-- 70% of the females

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:90%
died prematurely, 70%.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And all of the rats suffered
extreme organ damage.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about damage
to the liver, to the kidneys,

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
to the heart, but
also fertility.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:90%
This is a big issue.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You want to know why
there's so much infertility

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:90%
in the United States today?

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I believe that GMOs
are a part of that.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.841 align:middle line:84%
The infertility has been
shown in animal studies.

00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:57.540 align:middle line:90%
ED: Absolutely.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:84%
After three generations,
the rats were infertile

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:90%
and completely sterile.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And right now, Mike,
if you look at,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.010 align:middle line:84%
since GMOs were
introduced in 1996,

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
we have become an
infertile nation.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
infertility clinics

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:90%
practically on every corner.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:14.920 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: As much as dialysis.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:90%
ED: Males are becoming sterile.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
major situation.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would rank GMOs--
and the toxic effects of GMOs--

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.770 align:middle line:84%
as one of the number one, two,
or three major world crises

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: I completely agree.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
genetic pollution and the fact

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
that the entire biosphere
is being compromised,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.740 align:middle line:90%
threatened, by GMOs.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:84%
But to do that, let's go back
to this for just a second.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
I want to explain a
very important concept.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.680 align:middle line:84%
When companies like Monsanto
modify the genetic code

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
of a crop, they then claim
intellectual property ownership

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.010 align:middle line:90%
over that gene sequence.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And the way they
do that is, they

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:90%
apply to the US Patent Office.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:90%
And they say it's different.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:84%
You can't apply for a
patent on something that's

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
the same as, you know,
wild corn or normal,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:90%
common, conventional corn.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:90%
This is a special GMO corn.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.930 align:middle line:84%
They say, we own it
because we engineered it.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But then, when it
comes to talking

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:84%
to the FDA and the
USDA, Monsanto's lawyers

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:90%
say, wait a minute.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not different.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:90%
So we don't need to test it.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't need any
testing whatsoever.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:90%
It's safe because it's the same.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
But how can something be
the same and different

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:90%
at the same time, Ed?

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't make
any sense to me.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:10%
Maybe I'm just not lawyer
enough or something

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:34.870 align:middle line:10%
to be able to understand that.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:10%
But how can the
same be different?

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:10%
ED: Well Mike, if you
were creating GMOs

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.010 align:middle line:10%
and I was the one in
charge of approving

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.910 align:middle line:10%
those GMOs at the FDA, and
you came to me and said,

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:10%
hey, Ed, good buddy.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:10%
Here's some money
under the table.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Approve these.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.081 align:middle line:84%
Then, maybe we'd be talking
about a situation here.

00:08:52.081 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: That's true.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.240 align:middle line:84%
ED: I mean, because if
you look at the government

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Michael Taylor, our
food czar, used to be

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:90%
the attorney for Monsanto.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And he was the vice
president of Monsanto.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the USDA, you're going

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle line:90%
to see ex Monsanto employees.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have a
intertwined relationship

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:84%
between the FDA, the
USDA, the EPA, and

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:90%
these agroscience companies.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.949 align:middle line:84%
How can that be?
I mean--

00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: It's a revolving door.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget Donald Rumsfeld.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
He was with Monsanto before.
ED: That's right.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: He's the guy who helped
get this approved-- aspartame--

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:84%
which is actually the
fecal matter of genetically

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:90%
engineered bacteria.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So even aspartame, in addition
to producing formaldehyde

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, other chemicals
that are bad for you,

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.610 align:middle line:84%
it's also genetically
engineered by bacteria.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So Ed, let's talk about--
these GMOs are hard to avoid.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Is very difficult to
know because it's so

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:90%
insidious in the food supply.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about all
the hidden ingredients

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
where people are
taking in these GMOs

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing it
because a lot of people,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.590 align:middle line:90%
they're looking to avoid GMOs.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:84%
They know what
we're talking about.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.440 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to eat GMOs.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And they want them
labeled, one or the other.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.991 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to avoid them
because they're everywhere.

00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:90%
ED: That's right.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And you know, soy is
one of the biggest GMOs.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And soy is so
damaging because soy

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:84%
actually contains
phytoestrogens and phytic acids.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And it mimics
estrogen in the body.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Mike, we have
seven-year-old girls now

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.180 align:middle line:90%
having their menstrual cycle.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And think about the
effects of GMO soy

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:90%
altering the children's genes.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Again, the government
only approves,

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:84%
for welfare and WIC programs,
soy formulas for babies.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.326 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Oh, man.
ED: Right?

00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the worst things.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is just
so disheartening,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:84%
because how on earth can you
feed a baby who-- by the way,

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:84%
a child's immune system
is not fully developed

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:90%
until it's 12 years old.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:84%
A child's intestinal tract
is extremely sensitive.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:01.040 align:middle line:84%
You have babies that have
extreme allergies to foods

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:84%
because, at an early age,
they're on soy formulas.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:11.585 align:middle line:84%
They're on formulas that contain
GMO corn, GMO oils, and the Bt

00:11:11.585 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:84%
toxin, which is burning holes
through their intestinal lining

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:84%
causing, from birth, severe
allergies and severe problems.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
pediatrician's offices

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:84%
are just jam-packed
full with problems

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.025 align:middle line:90%
from all these GMO foods.

00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: And they don't tell
parents want to avoid.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at this,
since you brought it up.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Here's a product,
Similac Go and Grow.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:90%
This is infant formula.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Let me read for you just the
first four or five ingredients.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:90%
They will blow your mind.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Ingredient number one--
42.6% corn syrup solids.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.835 align:middle line:90%
ED: From genetically modified--

00:11:47.835 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: From GMO corn.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
ED: So number one
ingredient is a GMO corn.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: And it's 42%.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:57.623 align:middle line:84%
Are babies supposed to
eat 42% refined sugar?

00:11:57.623 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
ED: That right there
is child abuse, Mike.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that is poison.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: I believe it's
nutritional child abuse.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:84%
ED: I mean--
MIKE: OK.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Second ingredient-- 14.7%
soy protein isolate.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Soy.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:90%
GMO.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:84%
ED: Soy protein isolate is
actually a flavor enhancer.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's actually made with MSG.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.290 align:middle line:84%
MSG is added to soy
protein isolate.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Well and
also, soy protein is

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:84%
extracted, typically,
with hexane, a highly

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.560 align:middle line:90%
explosive chemical solvent.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think one
factory in the US

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
blew up, exploded, from
doing this process.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.869 align:middle line:84%
ED: I think so.
MIKE: OK.

00:12:33.869 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Next ingredient-- high
oleic safflower oil.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
That's not the worst
thing in the world.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing we've
seen in this that probably

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:90%
isn't really dangerous.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And then next, 10.1%
sugar-- sucrose.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
ED: So that's now up to like
50-something percent sugar now?

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.770 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: It's 53% sugar, so far.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:90%
And then we have 8.4% soy oil.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.817 align:middle line:84%
ED: Oh, that's other GMO
ingredient right there.

00:12:59.817 --> 00:13:00.950 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: And then,
after that it goes

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.940 align:middle line:84%
into artificial, synthetic,
chemical vitamins.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:84%
ED: By the way,
soy oil is actually

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:90%
listed as a vegetable oil.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
how they can do that.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not even a vegetable.
That's like--

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Yeah, well, I'm
sure that has fruit in it.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:84%
ED: Another way to hide
ingredients is just

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.346 align:middle line:90%
say vegetable oils, you know?

00:13:19.346 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not like broccoli oil
or something like that.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: But here, something else
I got to share with you, Ed.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.670 align:middle line:84%
This can is now a historical
artifact in American food

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
culture because, since I
publicized this starting about

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.960 align:middle line:84%
two years ago, they have
removed all these percentages

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.891 align:middle line:84%
from the label.
ED: Really?

00:13:36.891 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: Yeah.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:84%
They've taken off the
42.6% because they

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:90%
gave us too much information.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.510 align:middle line:90%
We went on the internet.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.990 align:middle line:90%
We were talking about this.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We were showing,
you know, babies

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.471 align:middle line:84%
are being fed these
incredible amounts of sugars.

00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:84%
It's crazy.
So the changed the label.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
But now, what you can
buy-- check this out.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Similac sensitive.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:90%
This is for fussiness and gas.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:84%
ED: Caused by the day
before feeding of the GMOs.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: GMOs cause
stomach information.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.430 align:middle line:90%
We already talked about that.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:90%
And then this formula--

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.922 align:middle line:84%
ED: So they actually show what's
causing it right on the label.

00:14:11.922 --> 00:14:13.555 align:middle line:84%
And it even says something
about shield on there.

00:14:13.555 --> 00:14:14.455 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: It says early shield.

00:14:14.455 --> 00:14:16.381 align:middle line:90%
It says early shield.

00:14:16.381 --> 00:14:17.780 align:middle line:84%
There's like a little
shield on the label.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:84%
This is supposed to shield
your baby from something.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:90%
We're not sure.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.210 align:middle line:10%
But it's actually-- actually,
Ed, it's accurately labeled.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the Similac
fussiness and gas formula.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:84%
It gives your baby
fussiness and gas.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what it does.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:84%
ED: It tells you exactly
what it does on the label.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.617 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: It says for
fussiness and gas.

00:14:34.617 --> 00:14:35.850 align:middle line:84%
ED: Now you wonder
why parents aren't

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:90%
getting any sleep at night.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Because they're feeding their
kids all these toxic baby

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:90%
formulas.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you're seeing
nutritional deficiencies.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean look, folks.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
They're starting at
an early age, Mike.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.810 align:middle line:84%
They know that if
they poison infants,

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.080 align:middle line:84%
then by the time--
and this is happening.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.110 align:middle line:84%
These things cause
obesity as well.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And as they feed
these to infants,

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:90%
the infants become obese.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.950 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing
degenerative diseases

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.376 align:middle line:84%
that we would normally see in
30-year-olds, 40-year-olds,

00:15:03.376 --> 00:15:04.075 align:middle line:90%
in children.

00:15:04.075 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Well, remember
type 2 diabetes

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
used to be called
adult onset diabetes.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.980 align:middle line:10%
They had to change the name
because children have it now.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're getting it
at nine, 10, 11 years old.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with cancers.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, 100 years ago, doctors
would travel hundreds of miles

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:84%
to find a cancer
patient to study

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:90%
because it was such an anomaly.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Now cancer's everywhere.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.554 align:middle line:90%
Now autism is everywhere.

00:15:25.554 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a show
on autism right here--

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:84%
ED: Absolutely.
Absolutely.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.489 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: --I'm telling
you, by the way.

00:15:29.489 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, watch
more of our shows.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to cover
autism in the future.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:84%
But all of these diseases
that are now devastating

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:84%
our society-- you got to get
back to what you're eating

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:90%
and how it's made.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And again, companies
like Monsanto

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:48.730 align:middle line:84%
are inserting, artificially,
through non-natural processes,

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:84%
genetic code to produce
poison whose sole purpose

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:90%
is to kill living systems.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.620 align:middle line:90%
That is the point of Bt toxin.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.687 align:middle line:90%
The point that I'm-- I'm sorry.

00:15:59.687 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't trying
to hold your hand.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:84%
ED: It actually makes the
stomachs of the bugs blow up,

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.010 align:middle line:90%
when they eat the Bt corn.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.050 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: Exactly.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:90%
It is a poison by design.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat the GMO
corn, you're eating poison.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.450 align:middle line:84%
ED: Think about everything
that you eat on a daily basis

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:90%
that has corn in it.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you start with
cereal in the morning.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the
soft drinks that we

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.960 align:middle line:90%
talked about, with corn.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Then you have chips like
this, corn chips everywhere.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Then you go have tortillas.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have breads
that are made with corn.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, corn is everywhere.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And soy is everywhere
these days, too.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's--

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.539 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: And let's talk about
some of the other ingredients.

00:16:36.539 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Right here is soy lecithin.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:90%
We have it conveniently labeled.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:84%
This is a GMO derivative
that is-- well,

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:84%
it has a nutritional
component, choline, I believe,

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:90%
acetylcholine.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But it also is used as a flow
agent in a lot of super foods

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:84%
like a filler because
this is dirt cheap.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of companies that
are making super foods,

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:84%
they'll buy a few
high-priced ingredients.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And they'll mix them with up to
50% of soy lecithin from GMOs.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And they'll call
it a super food.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.119 align:middle line:84%
ED: And protein powders,
too, contain soy lecithin.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And even vitamins and minerals
and stuff are containing

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.507 align:middle line:84%
genetically modified stuff.
MIKE: That's right.

00:17:16.507 --> 00:17:17.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C, in your
cheap, low-end

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:84%
vitamins-- your
multivitamins that you might

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:84%
buy at a convenience
store or grocery store--

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.700 align:middle line:84%
that vitamin C is
ascorbic acid derived

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle line:90%
from genetically modified corn.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Is not even full spectrum C. And
it's certainly not non-GMO C.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.940 align:middle line:84%
You actually have to
go out of your way

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:84%
to find vitamin C that's
derived from non-GMO sources.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:84%
ED: You know, Mike,
it makes you wonder

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
if the pharmaceutical companies
are tied into this whole thing

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
create sickness

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:90%
where you can create money.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And give them more
pharmaceuticals.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And you have this revolving
door between these three or four

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:84%
different industries
that, you know,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:84%
continually feed
themselves with money.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And why is it that these
corporations are spending

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
so much money and
setting up these seed

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:08.370 align:middle line:84%
vaults in the Arctics everywhere
to protect the natural seeds?

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I think they know that
they're going to contaminate

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:90%
the world with this stuff.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Well, let's talk
about genetic pollution.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
But first, to your point, I
believe it's 56 countries now

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.510 align:middle line:84%
that have either banned
GMOs or have demanded

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:90%
they be labeled on the foods.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.530 align:middle line:84%
But in the United States,
there's no real labeling.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:10%
For example, this Kellogg's
Pop-Tarts product most likely

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:10%
almost certainly contains GMOs.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:10%
But we don't know
100% because it's not

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:10%
required to be on the label.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:10%
But when you look at the
ingredients-- the corn syrup,

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:10%
the high fructose corn syrup,
the soy bean oil-- this is GMO.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:10%
But companies that
don't use GMOs

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.070 align:middle line:10%
like this company, the Better
Chip Company, specifically

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:10%
avoid GMOs.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And they say so
right on the label.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Right here it says, no
genetically modified

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:90%
ingredients.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:10%
The same thing is true
with Amy's kitchen

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:10%
products, Nature's Path.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.415 align:middle line:10%
ED: Organic products--

00:19:00.415 --> 00:19:01.115 align:middle line:10%
MIKE: Exactly.

00:19:01.115 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:10%
ED: --that say non-GMO verified.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:10%
There's a seal for that
that people can look for.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:10%
MIKE: Yep.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:10%
We'll show you that
a little bit later.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:10%
We've got some of
that here to show you.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.350 align:middle line:10%
But then, when you pick
up a bag of Doritos,

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:10%
let's say-- this
really loud-- this

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:10%
is made from, almost certainly,
again, genetically modified

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.520 align:middle line:10%
corn.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But you don't see a GMO
warning anywhere on the label.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact it's kind of like, if
you look at the ingredients

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
on this-- it's got MSG in it and
a bunch of other weird things,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.887 align:middle line:84%
artificial colors.
ED: Yeah.

00:19:28.887 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: I mean, look at it.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.886 align:middle line:84%
ED: That stuff's
just really toxic.

00:19:30.886 --> 00:19:32.759 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: That's not real food, man.
ED: You know what?

00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I actually called some
of the chip companies.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them when they
were planning on switching

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:90%
from GMOs to non-GMOs.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:41.535 align:middle line:84%
And they told me
over the phone it

00:19:41.535 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:90%
was too expensive at this time.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And they told me
that they could not

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:84%
source enough non-GMO material.
MIKE: Wow.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Well that's why, those
of you watching here,

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.140 align:middle line:84%
we really encourage
you to spread the word,

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:84%
because this is a victory
that we are going to achieve

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.270 align:middle line:90%
by shifting consumer demand.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Every time that you shop, when
you choose a non-GMO product

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
instead of a GMO
product, you are,

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:84%
in effect, investing
in a non-GMO future

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
for the entire food supply.
ED: Yes.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: When you buy GMOs, you
are-- well, think about this.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:84%
GMOs are one of the,
maybe the only thing,

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.770 align:middle line:90%
that you buy accidentally.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
you're buying them.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:90%
But you're buying them anyway.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, that money
is going to the farmer

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:90%
that grew GMO corn.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And that money's
going to Monsanto.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you buy GMO products
like in those Doritos

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
or these Pop-Tarts or
the breakfast cereals,

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:90%
you are supporting Monsanto.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.080 align:middle line:84%
ED: And by the way, Monsanto
is the same company that

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:84%
introduced Agent Orange and
DDT, that ran commercials

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.700 align:middle line:84%
in the early days
saying DDT was safe

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.990 align:middle line:84%
when the children were out
there playing in this big smoke

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle line:90%
of DDT and chemicals.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And now, DDT is found in breast
milk of 99% of the women.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: That's scary.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
We got to do an episode
on breastmilk, too.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think 50% of the
ingredient of DDT is 2,4-D,

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:84%
one of the most widespread
chemical pesticides.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Monsanto is right now
experimenting with crops that

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:84%
will be resistant to
2,4-D. They're being called

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:90%
Agent Orange-resistant crops.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:84%
ED: And that's because the weeds
are being resistant to Roundup.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't even get
into that conversation.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned Glyphosate.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:84%
But Glyphosate is nothing
more than Roundup.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:84%
The weed killer that you
probably have in your garage

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:90%
is extremely toxic.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.480 align:middle line:90%
It's damaging the soil.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Millions and millions of gallons
of that are being bought.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And again, you know, you talk
about environmental issues.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.980 align:middle line:84%
All that Glyphosate goes
back into the water supply.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.730 align:middle line:90%
It help-- kills the fish.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:90%
It alters the environment.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Destroys
the soil microbes.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:84%
ED: The ecosystem
is being destroyed.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And now, after three
or four or five years,

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean the farmers are having
to use three times, four times,

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:84%
five times as much of this
herbicide to control the weeds.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.901 align:middle line:84%
And the weeds are
becoming resistant to it.

00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: And let's talk.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:84%
ED: And we're getting Glyphosate
in our foods, as well.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: And Glyphosate
in our bodies,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:84%
which has been shown
to promote cancer

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:84%
at low parts per billion.
ED: Yes.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: We're talking
about very trace amounts

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.850 align:middle line:90%
now being linked to cancer.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:84%
That study just
came out recently.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:90%
But check this out.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Genes, obviously,
are self-replicating.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:84%
That's why you can
heal your skin.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:84%
That's why you can, you
know, have children.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Genes replicate.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens
when genes become

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.070 align:middle line:84%
pollution because they're
genetically engineered?

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Then you have
self-replicating pollution.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:90%
ED: Yes.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Now Ed, if you spill
oil in the Gulf of Mexico,

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.240 align:middle line:84%
as happened with
BP, even though it's

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:84%
bad-- it's a terrible
catastrophe-- you

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.160 align:middle line:84%
can eventually clean it
up and eliminate the oil,

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:90%
sooner or later.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:84%
With GMOs, you can never put
this back in Pandora's box

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:56.370 align:middle line:84%
because this is self-replicating
that keeps on growing.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there has been
contamination of fields that

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:84%
was completely
unexpected by Monsanto

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.610 align:middle line:90%
and unexpected by the USDA.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:84%
There are open field trials
being conducted right now where

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:10.480 align:middle line:84%
the wind and pollinators carry
those genes to other fields

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:90%
and contaminate those fields.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And Monsanto is so egotistical
about this, Ed, that actually

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
sue the farmer whose
fields got contaminated,

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:84%
saying that farmer stole
their intellectual property.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.600 align:middle line:84%
ED: Well, think about
this-- the impact on humans.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there has been
thousands, thousands

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.970 align:middle line:84%
of Indian farmers that have
committed suicide in India

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.970 align:middle line:84%
because what they normally
do-- they planted GMO cotton.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And what they normally do
is, when the cotton is done,

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:84%
they let their animals--
the ox, the buffalo,

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and the pigs and
everything-- go in

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:90%
and eat the rest of the plant.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Well what happened was,
these animals went in an ate

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:46.970 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the GM cotton.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.680 align:middle line:90%
And they all died.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
law in India that

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:56.680 align:middle line:84%
states that if the farmer
dies, his debt is released

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:90%
at the time of his death.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, these farmers
are so in debt

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
to Monsanto-- because they
bought all these seeds

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and they promised and they
signed contracts with Monsanto,

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to grow it anymore

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
so there's legal battles--
that these farmers are actually

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.260 align:middle line:84%
committing suicide
by the thousands.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: This becomes a system,
if you think about it,

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:84%
of corporate-run
agricultural servitude.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a form of slavery, just
using intellectual property

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and the Frankenfood system that
Monsanto has really pioneered.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned something
earlier too, Ed-- child abuse.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I think you would
agree with me when

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I say that feeding a
child these substances

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.890 align:middle line:84%
is a form of
nutritional child abuse.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, we would all agree
that it's wrong to beat a child

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and break their arm or
beat them black and blue

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.380 align:middle line:90%
to where you're harming them.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's a crime.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.270 align:middle line:90%
And it should be.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, why is it OK to damage
a child at the cellular level?

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Why is it OK to
poison their stomachs,

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:84%
to poison their organs,
to give them hugely

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.490 align:middle line:90%
increased risks of cancer?

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Why is that legal?

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.750 align:middle line:84%
ED: You know, the damaging
effects of doing that

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.720 align:middle line:90%
to your child is unbelievable.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
at pediatricians--

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and I've done studies
on children these days.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 15 years,
childhood allergies

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:90%
have gone through the roof.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:84%
One out of every two children--
even more than that, really,

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:84%
if you look at like 99
out of every 100 children

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:84%
will have some type
of food allergy.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
talk about solutions

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:90%
and how to detox GMOs.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But the doctors
that know-- which

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.750 align:middle line:84%
are very, very,
very few-- as soon

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:84%
as they take their
children off of all GMOs,

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:90%
the allergies go away.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And they start feeling
better, looking better.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.270 align:middle line:90%
They're not as hyperactive.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.960 align:middle line:84%
They're not throwing
temper tantrums.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:84%
They're not having rashes
all over their skins.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a major issue.
MIKE: Exactly.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:51.740 align:middle line:84%
You get to real
food, it's amazing

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:90%
how the body heals itself.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.100 align:middle line:84%
But now, let's talk
about solutions.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:84%
What can you do to avoid
these GMOs and recognize them,

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:84%
as we've talked about, both
for yourself and your family?

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:90%
ED: So yeah, Mike.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:04.483 align:middle line:84%
You know, I get the
question all the time--

00:26:04.483 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure you do, too-- how
do I detox my body from GMOs?

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Well, there's
two strategies, right?

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Detox and avoidance.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:90%
ED: Exactly.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.316 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: So let's talk
about avoidance

00:26:14.316 --> 00:26:15.480 align:middle line:90%
first because that's easier.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Here's a breakfast cereal from
a company called Nature's Path.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is really, in
my view, this is the best

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:90%
cereal company on the planet.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:90%
They never use GMOs.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And their entire product
line's certified organic.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And no, they didn't pay
us to plug their product.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.500 align:middle line:90%
This is just what we eat.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.730 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice that they--
you probably can't see it.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:84%
But they have a non-GMO Project
verified logo on the box.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:84%
You'll see this on
other products, as well.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Look for that logo.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Also look for the
USDA organic seal.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
That tells you that it
doesn't contain GMOs.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's number one-- avoiding.
ED: Avoid it.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: Yeah.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:90%
ED: Just switch to organic.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the best way
that we can say to avoid

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.495 align:middle line:90%
GMOs is to switch to organic.

00:26:56.495 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure the next
thing you're going to say

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.780 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to read
the ingredient label.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.560 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: Well, I think--

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.680 align:middle line:90%
ED: Which we always say.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.780 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Every show,
we tell people,

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:90%
read the ingredients labels.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:90%
Avoid soy.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.480 align:middle line:90%
And avoid non-organic corn.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, right there you're
going to avoid 90% of the GMOs

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.720 align:middle line:84%
in the food supply, if you
avoid those two things.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.490 align:middle line:90%
ED: Absolutely.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Avoid that.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the third thing, what
I recommend is, clean the body.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:90%
And give the body what it needs.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And how we do it is, we
keep the intestines clean.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And then we also supplement
with good probiotics.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And it usually takes
about 60 days to 90 days

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:84%
to repair-- completely repair--
the gut from GMO damage.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is,
it can be repaired.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And in studies where
they've taken workers

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:84%
down in South Africa that
were fed GMO corn while they

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.870 align:middle line:84%
worked in the field, they
were extremely sick, ill,

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:90%
even dying.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:84%
When they got them
off the GMO corn

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and put them back
on an organic corn

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:84%
diet or a non-GMO corn
diet, their symptoms

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.767 align:middle line:90%
went away within 30 to 60 days.

00:27:58.767 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Now, another
thing that you can do

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.370 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, grow
some of your own food.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I know gardening's
difficult. You know,

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.070 align:middle line:84%
but you can use
aquaponics systems

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.290 align:middle line:90%
to help out, make it easier.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.010 align:middle line:84%
You can garden at waist
level, just like right here.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:84%
You could have a
garden growing here.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:84%
You can juice some of
your own beets and kale,

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:90%
really easy to grow.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Carrots are super easy to
grow, even sweet potatoes.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Grow as much as you can.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, for the
things you have to buy,

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:84%
buy organic, chemical free,
local farmers markets, CSAs

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:90%
wherever possible.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Avoid food that's in
packages as much as possible.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.840 align:middle line:84%
If you get it in a package,
look for the non-GMO logo

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.250 align:middle line:90%
or the organic logo.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:84%
That right there will give
you 99% overall protection.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.720 align:middle line:90%
ED: Absolutely.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree with you.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:48.770 align:middle line:84%
It all comes back to what
you're putting in your mouth.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you
put in your mouth

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:84%
is either going to be toxic
or it's going to be non-toxic.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.980 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be live.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Life equals-- live equals life.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean really, if you think
about it, death equals death.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.790 align:middle line:84%
If you put dead, processed,
and garbage foods in it,

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.770 align:middle line:84%
it's going to cause death
over a period of time.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:11.170 align:middle line:84%
If you put live ingredients
and foods from nature that

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:13.900 align:middle line:84%
are organic into your
system, your body is

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:90%
going to turn into an organic--

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.630 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: And if you're suffering
from stomach inflammation

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.590 align:middle line:84%
right now because of what we
talked about with the GMOs,

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.490 align:middle line:90%
eat and drink soothing foods.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Get the GMOs out.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.390 align:middle line:84%
But start detoxing
your body with

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.570 align:middle line:90%
these alkaline fresh juices.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:84%
You're probably-- maybe you've
done some juicing in the past.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Do more of it.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, get some
celery juice, some apple

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:90%
juice, some kale juice, beets.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Put a little bit of
lemon in it if you want.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Get a juicing machine or a
juice press, whatever it takes.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:90%
You will heal yourself.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.981 align:middle line:84%
Because let's face it--
you have genetic code, too.

00:29:46.981 --> 00:29:47.680 align:middle line:90%
ED: Exactly.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.400 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: And your genetic code is
a blueprint for perfect health.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Perfect health--
that's your blueprint.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:56.050 align:middle line:84%
All you've got to do to
achieve that is to activate

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:84%
your genetic code that is the
blueprint for perfect health

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and stop compromising
your own genetic code.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.870 align:middle line:84%
ED: Mike, check out
these shocking facts

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:04.820 align:middle line:90%
that I came up with.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Did you know soy formulas
contain up to six times more

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:90%
cadmium than cow milk formula?

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And cadmium is one of the worst,
the largest single contributor

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.250 align:middle line:90%
to autoimmune thyroid disease.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:18.630 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: It's also an
estrogen mimicker.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.630 align:middle line:90%
ED: That's right.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Phytates in soy block the
absorption of zinc, iron,

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.911 align:middle line:84%
iodine, calcium, and magnesium.
MIKE: Wow.

00:30:25.911 --> 00:30:27.310 align:middle line:84%
ED: Why do you think
so many people have--

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Causing
nutritional deficiencies.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
ED: --mineral deficiencies?
MIKE: Yep.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:30.149 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:84%
ED: Soy protein isolate,
which we talked about earlier,

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:36.310 align:middle line:84%
always contains hidden
MSG to cause addictions.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.370 align:middle line:84%
It's all about addictions
with these foods.

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And soy protein
isolate produces twice

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
the IGF-1-- that's
insulin growth

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.410 align:middle line:90%
factor 1-- than cow's milk.

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:52.230 align:middle line:84%
IGF-1 is the strongest cancer
stimulator humans consume.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And rats were fed GMO
Roundup Ready corn.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.760 align:middle line:84%
They suffered severe
adverse effects,

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.920 align:middle line:84%
including mammary
tumors, kidney, liver

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.660 align:middle line:90%
damage, and premature death.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.170 align:middle line:84%
More than half the
babies of mother rats

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:84%
fed GM soy died
within three weeks.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
hamsters becoming infertile.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:84%
But soy allergy skyrocketed
by 50% in Europe

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.440 align:middle line:90%
after GM soy was introduced.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's plenty
of studies out there

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:20.970 align:middle line:90%
that prove this.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:21.910 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: Well, that's our show.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:25.160 align:middle line:84%

MIKE: And remember, as we
both agree, just say no--

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:90%
BOTH: --to GMO.
