00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.536 align:middle line:90%
I'm Mike Adams of Natural News.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Edward Group:
And I'm Dr. Group

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:38.972 align:middle line:90%
with Global Healing Center.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.774 align:middle line:84%
Today we have a great
show for you.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.276 align:middle line:90%
It is called Fake Foods exposed.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:46.246 align:middle line:84%
And I am standing here with
one of the leading experts

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:49.015 align:middle line:84%
in food investigators,
Mike Adams,

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:51.284 align:middle line:90%
who has a forensic food lab.

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:52.586 align:middle line:90%
Mike, tell us what you found

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.788 align:middle line:84%
with all these fake
ingredients in food?

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, today we're going
to focus on a number of things

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.993 align:middle line:84%
but blueberries, in particular,
because if you go out

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:03.295 align:middle line:84%
and you buy foods, let's say
you're buying blueberry bagels

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:06.633 align:middle line:84%
or a blueberry waffle or
even blueberry muffins

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.568 align:middle line:84%
or breakfast cereals
or anything,

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.104 align:middle line:84%
you think that you're
buying real blueberries

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.307 align:middle line:84%
and getting the real nutrition
from those blueberries

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:16.409 align:middle line:84%
in those foods; but
it turns out, Ed --

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.512 align:middle line:84%
and this is what we're going
to show people today --

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:20.814 align:middle line:84%
most of those blueberries,
not all of them,

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
but most of them
are, in fact, fake.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.351 align:middle line:90%
They're not real.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.488 align:middle line:84%
They're made with artificial
food colors, propylene glycol.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:29.623 align:middle line:84%
We'll go through the
other ingredients

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:30.824 align:middle line:90%
that they're actually made from.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.894 align:middle line:84%
Now, Ed, I've got to ask
you why does that matter?

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:34.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Why
does that matter?

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:38.431 align:middle line:84%
Because food is toxic
when it's processed

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.635 align:middle line:84%
and when you use artificial
colors, artificial sweeteners,

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:43.236 align:middle line:90%
high fructose corn syrup.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:47.807 align:middle line:84%
All that does, Mike, is just
add more toxins to the body,

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:51.545 align:middle line:84%
causes immune response, causes
aggressiveness in children,

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:55.315 align:middle line:84%
causes ADD hyperactivity,
and the fact

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.617 align:middle line:84%
that our body doesn't know how
to break it down [inaudible].

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.318 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.619 align:middle line:90%
I guess we weren't made

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.922 align:middle line:84%
to eat petrol chemicals
disguised as food coloring.

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:04.724 align:middle line:84%
But to get started, let's first
show people the difference

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:08.595 align:middle line:84%
between fake blueberries and
real blueberries so everybody is

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.331 align:middle line:84%
on the same page about what the
difference really looks like.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:12.332 align:middle line:90%
And to do that, we're going

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.634 align:middle line:84%
to show you some
photos and some videos.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:15.835 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:17.804 align:middle line:84%
These photos are from
the Natural News Forensic

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:18.939 align:middle line:90%
Food Laboratory.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.675 align:middle line:84%
I took these myself with
our digital microscope.

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:25.512 align:middle line:84%
The first photo here shows you
what a real blueberry looks

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:28.582 align:middle line:84%
like at over 100
times magnification.

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:32.786 align:middle line:84%
And if you look closely, you
can see tiny seeds inside the

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.288 align:middle line:84%
blueberry that look like
little tiny almonds,

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:36.523 align:middle line:84%
but they're actually
blueberry seeds,

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:39.359 align:middle line:84%
kind of like microscopic
strawberry seeds.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.695 align:middle line:84%
Real blueberries
have real seeds.

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:45.465 align:middle line:84%
But then if you look at some
foods, like this waffle,

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:49.369 align:middle line:84%
look as we dissect this
waffle under the microscope

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see that, as we
tear open the dough to look

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.676 align:middle line:84%
for the blueberry, we find
there is no blueberry.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.813 align:middle line:90%
It only contains purple dough.

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:01.147 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So that was
pretty shocking, Mike.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.949 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, I mean,
you're doing some great work,

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:06.653 align:middle line:84%
and you're showing people why
they need to pay attention

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.521 align:middle line:90%
to reading the labels.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.491 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at labels of
the standard foods these days,

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
you're just going to
see a slew of chemicals.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.464 align:middle line:84%
And really what we want to do
is show people how these things

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:18.565 align:middle line:90%
are made.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.001 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you can
actually see the fact,

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.036 align:middle line:84%
that you're putting
these toxic chemicals

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:28.141 align:middle line:84%
and mixing these toxic
chemicals in to toxic doughs

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:32.312 align:middle line:84%
and everything else, hopefully,
Mike, people will wake up

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:33.947 align:middle line:84%
and they won't feed these
things to their kids

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:36.915 align:middle line:84%
or they won't feed themselves
anymore with this kind of stuff.

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:37.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Well, exactly.

00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:38.617 align:middle line:90%
I want to show you right here.

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:40.954 align:middle line:90%
On camera, we have the props.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:42.522 align:middle line:90%
We have the chemicals

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:46.393 align:middle line:84%
to actually make our own
fake blueberry dough.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:47.627 align:middle line:84%
So here's what we're
going to do.

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:50.096 align:middle line:84%
We've got some dough
here in a pan.

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.165 align:middle line:84%
We've got real blueberries
on one side.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:54.266 align:middle line:84%
We got some fake blueberry
cereal on the other,

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:55.468 align:middle line:90%
just to show you the difference.

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:57.137 align:middle line:90%
We're going to use the dyes,

00:03:57.137 --> 00:03:59.773 align:middle line:84%
the propylene glycol,
which is antifreeze.

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:02.208 align:middle line:84%
It's actually used to
winterize RV's and trucks.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:04.978 align:middle line:90%
We've got some of that here.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.846 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to use some --

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.548 align:middle line:84%
we can throw some
sugar in it if we want.

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:12.585 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make our own
artificial blueberry dough,

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.187 align:middle line:84%
which is just like what
you buy in the store.

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:15.588 align:middle line:90%
So let's get right to that, Ed.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:16.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well, the first
thing, Mike, is we're going

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.258 align:middle line:90%
to actually mix the dyes.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.826 align:middle line:90%
And for people who don't know,

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.661 align:middle line:84%
there's actually
eight dyes out there.

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:23.029 align:middle line:90%
These are artificial dyes.

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:90%
There's two reds.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.965 align:middle line:90%
There's two blues.

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:26.366 align:middle line:90%
There's two yellows.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.768 align:middle line:84%
There's a green and
there's also an orange.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Now all these dyes have been
tested to be toxic to the body.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.776 align:middle line:84%
And red forty, Mike, is
actually extremely toxic.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:41.314 align:middle line:84%
These dyes are carcinogens; yet
the FDA still allows these dyes

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:44.517 align:middle line:84%
in food, even though a
lot of these companies

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:47.687 align:middle line:84%
that use these artificial
dyes in the UK

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:50.957 align:middle line:84%
and other countries
have the same product

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:55.061 align:middle line:84%
but use natural dyes
outside of the United States.

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.731 align:middle line:84%
Now people might think oh,
well, these dyes are harmless

00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:00.033 align:middle line:84%
because they're approved by
the FDA; but I can tell you,

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:03.236 align:middle line:84%
my kid has been raised
on an organic diet,

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:06.473 align:middle line:84%
and he went to a birthday
party one time and came back

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.775 align:middle line:90%
with extreme hyperactivity.

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:09.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Just from the dyes?

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:10.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Just
from the dyes.

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.879 align:middle line:90%
And it is a major problem.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's because they're
derived from petrol chemicals.

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:18.952 align:middle line:84%
Now watch as I put this food
dye in this beaker of water,

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:21.087 align:middle line:84%
as we're going to start
making our -- whoa.

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:22.589 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of dye.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:24.858 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make our
artificial blueberry.

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:28.795 align:middle line:84%
We stir it around a little bit
and we have, as you can see

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:30.663 align:middle line:84%
against the white here, you
can see [multiple speakers].

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.332 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Let's stir
that around a little bit.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.632 align:middle line:90%
Whoa. What is that, man?

00:05:33.632 --> 00:05:35.034 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a vaccine shot.

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:35.969 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:36.469 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, no.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.137 align:middle line:90%
That's --

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:37.937 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Okay.

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:39.339 align:middle line:90%
Something else has stopped.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.174 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You'll start to notice
that the color of this starts

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:44.477 align:middle line:84%
to look like this cereal,
which is Frosted Mini Wheats,

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:47.113 align:middle line:84%
blueberry flavor, that
has no blueberries in it,

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.149 align:middle line:84%
but the colors started
to look the same.

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:50.483 align:middle line:90%
I think we need some green, Ed.

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:51.518 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes, we do.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:52.886 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Let's get
some green in here.

00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:54.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So these fake
blueberries usually contain blue

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:58.024 align:middle line:84%
dye, green dye and
also red number forty.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:58.992 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: There we go
[multiple speakers].

00:05:58.992 --> 00:05:59.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: There
goes the green.

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:01.361 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Give me that syringe.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.563 align:middle line:90%
HPV vaccine is coming up next.

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:06.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: The reason why
these food companies use these

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:10.437 align:middle line:84%
dyes is because it's a lot
less expensive to use chemicals

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:13.339 align:middle line:84%
than it is to use
actual real foods, Mike.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:14.541 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: And exactly.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.842 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that's
really important to know

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:19.446 align:middle line:84%
about this is in a real
blueberry, that you see here,

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.314 align:middle line:84%
this blueberry has
vital nutrients,

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:23.016 align:middle line:90%
which are natural medicines.

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:26.953 align:middle line:84%
They include things like
resveratrol, flavonols,

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:29.989 align:middle line:84%
fikosianin and other
natural chemicals

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:33.626 align:middle line:84%
that the plant actually produces
that function as medicines

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:36.162 align:middle line:84%
in your body to support
your cardiovascular system,

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:38.765 align:middle line:84%
your nervous system,
eyesight, many other things.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:42.969 align:middle line:84%
But this artificial
thing over here has none

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:47.373 align:middle line:84%
of those natural medicinal
nutrients or chemicals,

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:48.708 align:middle line:90%
depending on how you look at it.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:52.011 align:middle line:84%
This is artificial color
just to fool your eyes

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:54.447 align:middle line:84%
and make you think you're
buying real blueberries when,

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:56.149 align:middle line:90%
in fact, they're fake.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.217 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:06:57.217 --> 00:06:58.952 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the human body
and the metabolism

00:06:58.952 --> 00:07:02.489 align:middle line:84%
and the biochemistry
is designed to work off

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:04.224 align:middle line:90%
of natural things in nature.

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:07.994 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we never had all these
artificial chemicals and toxins

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:90%
until less than 100 years ago.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.834 align:middle line:84%
Now we've completely gotten
away from natural foods and gone

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:18.538 align:middle line:84%
to man-made foods
because it's cheaper

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:22.442 align:middle line:84%
and also the pharmaceutical
companies are making more money

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:90%
because more people are sick.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, that's
another point.

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:26.346 align:middle line:84%
We got to talk about
that in more detail.

00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:27.714 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's
do our demo here.

00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:29.582 align:middle line:84%
I got a little blue
on you there, Ed.

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:30.917 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.019 align:middle line:84%
Somebody on the sidewalk will
be happy to lick that off

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:34.888 align:middle line:84%
of your glove later, because
this is the stuff they

00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:35.989 align:middle line:90%
actually eat.

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I wouldn't
want to poison them.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.791 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So what we're going to
do now is we're actually going

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:43.129 align:middle line:84%
to inject our bread with some
artificial blueberry color, and,

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:46.533 align:middle line:84%
as you can see, we're making
little blueberry pieces.

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:48.501 align:middle line:84%
Let me hold this up so that
everybody can see very clearly.

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Here,
I'll hold that for you.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:50.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Check it out.

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:54.641 align:middle line:90%
This looks kind of like this,

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.342 align:middle line:84%
just the color is a
little bit different.

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:84%
They look like little
blueberries.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.781 align:middle line:84%
And if we added some artificial
fragrance, some flavors

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:04.617 align:middle line:84%
that you can smell, it would
even smell like blueberries.

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:05.952 align:middle line:90%
Now we're not done though.

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:07.287 align:middle line:90%
We got to put the antifreeze in.

00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:08.488 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.889 align:middle line:84%
And talking about artificial
flavors, by the way,

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:13.226 align:middle line:84%
the reason they add artificial
flavors is because the food is

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:16.796 align:middle line:84%
so processed and man-made
that it's not even food,

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:18.932 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't even
have a taste to it.

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:22.669 align:middle line:84%
So they have to add artificial
flavors and natural color,

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.771 align:middle line:84%
I mean, natural flavors,
which, by the way,

00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:26.706 align:middle line:84%
natural flavors are
even disguised.

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:27.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:28.207 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:29.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And
artificial flavors

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:30.577 align:middle line:84%
and natural flavors
actually contain MSG

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:32.478 align:middle line:90%
and other toxic chemicals.

00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:32.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:34.213 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:34.781 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: This is
propylene glycol right here.

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:35.348 align:middle line:90%
Now this is --

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yep.

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: --
antifreeze, like Mike said,

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.053 align:middle line:84%
and this is actually not
only added to food but is

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:41.921 align:middle line:90%
in many skin care products.

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:46.059 align:middle line:84%
And if someone has a
rash or skin problems,

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:48.795 align:middle line:84%
most likely they're
consuming propylene glycol.

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:50.196 align:middle line:90%
It's highly allergic as well.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Okay.

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:54.167 align:middle line:84%
This stuff right here, as
I said, this is antifreeze,

00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:56.936 align:middle line:84%
and it's on the ingredient's
label.

00:08:56.936 --> 00:09:01.074 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just to let you know,
here, I'm reading a label

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:03.276 align:middle line:90%
of a blueberry muffin mix.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.878 align:middle line:84%
Do you see propylene
glycol right there, Ed?

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:06.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes, I do see --

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:07.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yep.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:08.514 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: --
propylene glycol.

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:09.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: There it is.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: It's amazing

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.385 align:middle line:84%
that they can actually put
these things on the label --

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:13.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yep.

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- and
people actually --

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: People eat it.

00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:15.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: -- eat it.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:15.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yep.

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:17.156 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:18.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Hey, and we could
microwave this bread later

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:20.393 align:middle line:84%
and actually have
this for lunch.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.227 align:middle line:90%
What do you say?

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.161 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Well, then it will --

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:23.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That
sounds like fun.

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:24.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: -- be radiated and
it will be extremely toxic.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Who
knows what happens.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.634 align:middle line:84%
See, Mike brought
up a good point.

00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:29.135 align:middle line:90%
You take all these chemicals,

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:32.605 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people put
their food in a microwave.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:34.774 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens to all
these chemicals, Mike,

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.409 align:middle line:90%
once you microwave them?

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.577 align:middle line:90%
I mean --

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: They get modified
by the microwave --

00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:38.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:39.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: -- energy.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:40.813 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:41.648 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Making them even more
dangerous to human health.

00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:43.416 align:middle line:90%
But look, let's go through --

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:46.519 align:middle line:84%
this is our example
of how to make fake --

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:49.355 align:middle line:84%
now, those of you watching,
you wouldn't eat this, right,

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.224 align:middle line:90%
knowing what we just did.

00:09:51.224 --> 00:09:55.395 align:middle line:84%
And yet when you go to the store
and you buy things like this,

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:59.832 align:middle line:84%
Kellogg's Frosted Mini
Wheats, blueberry cereal.

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:01.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: This has no
blueberries in it folks.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:05.638 align:middle line:84%
This is purple sugar and
purple dough essentially.

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
There are no blueberries
in this product.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.776 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want that
anywhere around here.

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.144 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:15.515 align:middle line:84%
Captain Crunch, Oops,
All Berries cereal,

00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:17.717 align:middle line:90%
which contains no berries.

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:19.052 align:middle line:90%
It says Oops.

00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:20.853 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: But it's got a
lot of colorful things there

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:23.189 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
catch the kids' eyes.

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:23.756 align:middle line:90%
And --

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:25.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- mom and dad
will at least buy that for them.

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:28.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Notice that the
box is actually designed

00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:32.632 align:middle line:84%
to mimic the shape and the color
of really nutritious berries.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:33.933 align:middle line:90%
This is deception.

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:36.936 align:middle line:84%
This is like stage magic for
parents to make them think

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.738 align:middle line:84%
that oh, they're some --
they're buying something

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:39.839 align:middle line:90%
that could be healthy.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.574 align:middle line:90%
It fools. It tricks the eyes.

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:44.911 align:middle line:84%
It's basic human psychology
to look for bright colors,

00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:47.647 align:middle line:84%
because colors are
medicines and foods.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.882 align:middle line:84%
So when parents see
this box, they think oh,

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:51.217 align:middle line:90%
it must be good for you.

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:54.187 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't sell it if
it were bad for you; right?

00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:56.355 align:middle line:84%
The FDA wouldn't allow them
to do that, would they?

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:57.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well,
we would hope not.

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:01.027 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately the FDA allows
pretty much every type

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:02.361 align:middle line:90%
of food toxin.

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I think really
what the thing that we need

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:84%
to do is start training our
children to read labels.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.369 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my kids -- I
have a seven-year-old

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:10.403 align:middle line:90%
and a five-year-old --

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:11.604 align:middle line:84%
they actually know
how to read a label.

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:12.939 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Really?

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:14.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: They really
know how to read a label, yes,

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:15.241 align:middle line:90%
and they understand it.

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:16.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, first
we have to teach --

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:16.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Can you imagine?

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:18.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: -- kids to read.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.779 align:middle line:90%
That's another show.

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:21.314 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Can you imagine
though if kids knew how

00:11:21.314 --> 00:11:24.283 align:middle line:84%
to read labels and knew the
toxic compounds in there?

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:26.886 align:middle line:84%
There should be a class in
school about how to read.

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:28.955 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about food.

00:11:28.955 --> 00:11:32.058 align:middle line:84%
I mean, food takes care of your
energy levels in your body.

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:33.192 align:middle line:90%
It takes care of your --

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Your healing,
your immune function.

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:34.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Immune function.

00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:35.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Brain function,
learning.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:36.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Your skin growth.

00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:37.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Everything.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Everything.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:38.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:40.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Why
wouldn't we be focusing

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:44.337 align:middle line:84%
on teaching our children in
schools how to learn about food

00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:45.338 align:middle line:84%
and ingredients and
what food does --

00:11:45.338 --> 00:11:46.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: I know.

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: -- to the body?

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.207 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I know,
but this is the kind

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:48.775 align:middle line:84%
of stuff that's being
promoted to kids.

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:49.342 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:11:49.342 --> 00:11:50.877 align:middle line:90%
Total cereal.

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:54.013 align:middle line:84%
Blueberry Pomegranate
is the name,

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.548 align:middle line:90%
the Total Blueberry Pomegranate.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.717 align:middle line:84%
This is positioned
as a healthy cereal.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.819 align:middle line:84%
Ed, do you think it
has any blueberries

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:01.954 align:middle line:84%
or any pomegranates
in the cereal?

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:03.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well,
they must, Mike,

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:06.325 align:middle line:84%
because it says right here,
100 percent nutrition.

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike, Yeah, well,
100 percent.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: So that means

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:10.763 align:middle line:84%
that it must just have
everything perfect

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:11.898 align:middle line:90%
in there for you.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:14.267 align:middle line:84%
And Mike, it even says
100 percent daily value

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:15.768 align:middle line:90%
of 12 vitamins and minerals.

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It does.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:17.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I wonder if those
are coming from the blueberries?

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:19.238 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Guess what?

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:21.541 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the ingredients,
labels, there are no blueberries

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:24.043 align:middle line:84%
and there are no
pomegranates in this cereal.

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:26.946 align:middle line:84%
General Mills is selling you
blueberries and pomegranates

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:30.917 align:middle line:84%
in your mind, like a
little hypnosis thing.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:31.684 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I'm shocked.

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:32.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:33.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: They're
supposed --

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:34.554 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's amazing.

00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:35.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Imagine
you're eating blueberries

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:36.456 align:middle line:90%
and pomegranates.

00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:39.058 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I don't know,
they're selling you your

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:40.293 align:middle line:90%
own imagination.

00:12:40.293 --> 00:12:42.161 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I wonder if
your body believes it?

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:43.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I don't know.

00:12:43.362 --> 00:12:45.031 align:middle line:84%
That would be a whole
another show right there.

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:46.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: But let's
show some products

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:48.734 align:middle line:84%
that actually do
contain real blueberries,

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:51.904 align:middle line:84%
because some companies are
now conscientious enough

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:53.806 align:middle line:84%
about this issue
to use real ones.

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:54.907 align:middle line:90%
So check this out.

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:56.275 align:middle line:90%
You may be surprised,

00:12:56.275 --> 00:13:01.013 align:middle line:84%
but Kellogg's Pop Tarts actually
uses real blueberries baked

00:13:01.013 --> 00:13:04.417 align:middle line:84%
with real fruit, about
10 percent real fruit.

00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:06.853 align:middle line:84%
The other 90 percent, we're
not sure what that stuff is.

00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:08.354 align:middle line:84%
It probably involves
some of this.

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:10.389 align:middle line:84%
But it leaves us
10 percent real,

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:11.591 align:middle line:84%
and there are real
blueberries in it.

00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:12.825 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about Pop Tarts?

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to have
some of these for lunch?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You know,
if I ate these up,

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:18.798 align:middle line:84%
I probably cause a serious
reaction in my body.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.833 align:middle line:84%
But again, you know, all
this stuff we're talking

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:24.904 align:middle line:84%
about here says naturally
and artificially flavored.

00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:26.706 align:middle line:90%
If anything says naturally

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:28.808 align:middle line:84%
and artificially
flavored, put it down.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Mike, there's
so many different things

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.379 align:middle line:84%
on this ingredient
list; enriched flour.

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Do you know --

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.181 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:36.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- why they
have to enrich things?

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:37.383 align:middle line:84%
[multiple speakers] because
there's nothing in it

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:38.751 align:middle line:90%
to begin with; so they have

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:41.754 align:middle line:84%
to add synthetic
vitamins to these things.

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:42.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's right.

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:43.956 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And
do you know what?

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.091 align:middle line:84%
These synthetic vitamins
actually do you more harm

00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:46.259 align:middle line:90%
than good.

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, let's
continue with the list.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.728 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:13:48.728 --> 00:13:51.964 align:middle line:84%
This is a blueberry
muffin mix that I bought,

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:53.966 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not, at Walmart.

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:57.069 align:middle line:84%
I really went to Walmart for
the show, and I shopped around

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:58.271 align:middle line:90%
and bought all this stuff.

00:13:58.271 --> 00:13:59.639 align:middle line:90%
And I saw other people around me

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:02.008 align:middle line:84%
with their carts full
of this kind of food.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.977 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are no blueberries
in this blueberry muffin mix,

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:08.114 align:middle line:84%
even though it says
just add milk.

00:14:08.114 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Another substance we might want
to talk about on another show.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But how do you have a blueberry
mix with no blueberries?

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.554 align:middle line:90%
Well, check this out.

00:14:15.554 --> 00:14:17.623 align:middle line:84%
Here's the Walmart brand
of blueberry waffles,

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:20.393 align:middle line:84%
called Great Value
Blueberry Waffles.

00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:23.396 align:middle line:84%
I actually dissected
these waffles

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:25.765 align:middle line:84%
under the microscope,
as you saw earlier.

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:30.469 align:middle line:84%
I could not find any blueberries
whatsoever in this product,

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:33.806 align:middle line:84%
even though it claims some
kind of blueberry puree

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:37.843 align:middle line:84%
or blueberry juice in the
actual ingredient's list,

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:42.081 align:middle line:84%
along with blue number two,
red number forty, sugar,

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:45.651 align:middle line:84%
soybean derivatives and
many other type, or canola,

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:47.019 align:middle line:90%
many other types of ingredients,

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:48.721 align:middle line:84%
that we would want
to avoid anyway.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:49.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: You know,

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:84%
does that have propylene
glycol in it, by the way?

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I don't know if it's
got propylene glycol in it,

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:55.828 align:middle line:84%
but it's definitely
not real blueberries.

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:57.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: You know, I had

00:14:57.096 --> 00:15:00.433 align:middle line:84%
to ask why they put propylene
glycol in these things,

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:02.935 align:middle line:84%
and the reason they put
propylene glycol in there --

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:05.338 align:middle line:84%
it's a petroleum-based
product, by the way --

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:08.140 align:middle line:84%
is that it keeps
everything moist.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And because you're using
all these chemicals

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:14.313 align:middle line:84%
and preservatives and
compounds in there,

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:15.514 align:middle line:90%
these things can -- look.

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:18.117 align:middle line:84%
Look how hard this waffle
is that just sat out.

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:20.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So probably it
doesn't have propylene glycol

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:21.687 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:22.621 align:middle line:84%
But these are the kinds of
things that you want to look

00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:23.789 align:middle line:90%
for on the label and figure

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:25.157 align:middle line:84%
out why they're putting
them in there.

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:26.559 align:middle line:90%
I mean --

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:27.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, we've had this
muffin out for at least 24 hours

00:15:27.727 --> 00:15:28.761 align:middle line:90%
and it's still kind of moist.

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:29.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And
that is still moist.

00:15:29.562 --> 00:15:30.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It's kind of chewy.

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.131 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That has
propylene glycol in it.

00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:33.432 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: And check it out.

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.835 align:middle line:84%
But actually, by the way,
this muffin, check this out.

00:15:35.835 --> 00:15:39.305 align:middle line:84%
Little Debbie brand is
using real blueberries.

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:40.072 align:middle line:90%
This is a shocker.

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:41.173 align:middle line:90%
I know you'll be shocked.

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:44.877 align:middle line:84%
But I spent a lot of
time dissecting foods

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:45.678 align:middle line:90%
under the microscope.

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:46.846 align:middle line:90%
I know, it's a weird hobby.

00:15:46.846 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You
are the expert.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: But that's what I do.

00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:51.717 align:middle line:84%
And little Debbie
Blueberry Muffins actually do

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:52.818 align:middle line:90%
contain blueberries.

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I know this because,
if you pull them apart,

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.322 align:middle line:90%
you can see the seeds inside.

00:15:56.322 --> 00:16:00.559 align:middle line:84%
But like many other
products that actually --

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:02.561 align:middle line:84%
they can enhance
the real blueberries

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:06.365 align:middle line:84%
by adding more food coloring
to sort of multiply the effect,

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:09.769 align:middle line:84%
you know, a little bit of
real and a lot of imitation,

00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:12.872 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we see in many
products across the industry.

00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:15.808 align:middle line:84%
And this thing is starting
to expand, by the way.

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:90%
It's looking a little freaky.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.544 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Mike, what

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:20.279 align:middle line:84%
about other different
types of fake fruits?

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:22.848 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you done any
research on fake strawberries?

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yes.

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:25.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And fake other
things that are in food?

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:26.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, now that you
mention it, check it out.

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:30.689 align:middle line:84%
Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats
Strawberry Delight flavor

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:32.625 align:middle line:90%
contains no strawberries.

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:36.095 align:middle line:84%
So you know, there used to
be a law in America where,

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.731 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't have the thing
that you put on the label,

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:84%
you would have to use
the word, imitation.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.836 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have to say
imitation strawberry flavor

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:46.872 align:middle line:84%
or imitation blueberry muffins
or, you know, imitation.

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:48.307 align:middle line:90%
Right? Well, guess what?

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:51.944 align:middle line:84%
The food industry lobbied
the FDA to take the word,

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:53.679 align:middle line:90%
imitation, off the labels.

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:54.947 align:middle line:90%
It was a couple decades ago.

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:56.315 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the exact date.

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:59.785 align:middle line:84%
But since then, they could
just lie to you on the labels

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:02.721 align:middle line:84%
and name fruits that
aren't in the box.

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:04.957 align:middle line:90%
How is that not deceptive?

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:05.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean,
I don't know.

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:07.593 align:middle line:90%
That's just seriously deceptive.

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:10.763 align:middle line:84%
You know, they just did a
study and it was published

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:16.302 align:middle line:84%
in the Lancet, qualified British
Medical Journal, on the effects,

00:17:16.302 --> 00:17:19.572 align:middle line:84%
the negative effects,
of food dyes on children

00:17:19.572 --> 00:17:21.373 align:middle line:90%
that cause hyperactivity.

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:25.577 align:middle line:84%
You know, people are wondering
why is my child hyperactive.

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:27.947 align:middle line:84%
Okay. They eat this
stuff in the morning.

00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:29.982 align:middle line:84%
They send their children
to school, Mike.

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:32.718 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
The nurse at school
calls the parents,

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.222 align:middle line:90%
says they're hyperactive.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:37.323 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:17:37.323 --> 00:17:39.892 align:middle line:84%
The parent takes their
child to the doctor.

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.494 align:middle line:90%
They get put on Adderall --

00:17:41.494 --> 00:17:42.761 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yep.

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:43.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- Ritalin,
prescription medications,

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:46.398 align:middle line:90%
and this was the cause.

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:47.066 align:middle line:90%
I've talked to --

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: This is --

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:49.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- a lot
of moms that as soon

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.436 align:middle line:84%
as they took their
kids off of the dyes --

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, yeah.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- and all
this stuff, MSG and some

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:56.175 align:middle line:84%
of the other artificial things,
all the symptoms go away.

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:57.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, check
this out, Ed.

00:17:57.176 --> 00:18:00.546 align:middle line:84%
I also brought beans,
guacamole dip.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:03.015 align:middle line:90%
It contains no avocados.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:06.552 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do you make
guacamole without avocados?

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:07.486 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:08.621 align:middle line:84%
Beans have figured
it out though.

00:18:08.621 --> 00:18:11.624 align:middle line:84%
They use soybean oil and
green food colorings.

00:18:11.624 --> 00:18:13.225 align:middle line:90%
See, green.

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:16.061 align:middle line:84%
If you just whip up a bunch
of oils, a little bit of onion

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:18.164 align:middle line:84%
and garlic and some
green food coloring,

00:18:18.164 --> 00:18:21.200 align:middle line:84%
you too can use the word,
guacamole, on your product

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.469 align:middle line:84%
and it will be sold
nationwide by Walmart

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:25.471 align:middle line:90%
and other fine food retailers.

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole business model, Ed.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.474 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:29.608 align:middle line:90%
We should be making baked foods.

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:90%
People keep buying this stuff.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:32.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You
know, they buy it,

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.613 align:middle line:84%
because I don't really
know why they buy it.

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:36.415 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, you know, that's
why we're doing this show,

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:37.917 align:middle line:84%
so we can expose
it, and hopefully

00:18:37.917 --> 00:18:41.554 align:middle line:84%
that we can convince
the general public

00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:43.155 align:middle line:90%
to start reading the labels.

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:44.957 align:middle line:84%
You know some -- I get
a lot of questions.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:48.594 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens when
I eat all this stuff?

00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:52.097 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is, you
know, if you were to eat this

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:55.568 align:middle line:84%
and immediately have to go to
the hospital, and that happened

00:18:55.568 --> 00:19:00.573 align:middle line:84%
for everybody, these would not
be allowed; but the problem lies

00:19:00.573 --> 00:19:04.009 align:middle line:84%
in you can take a drop of
poison every single day

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:06.512 align:middle line:84%
and it won't effect you,
and it won't cause disease

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:90%
for a long period of time.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.149 align:middle line:90%
So these are slow killers.

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:12.518 align:middle line:84%
But when you combine
the slow killers of food

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and the slow killers of
beverages and the slow killers

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.389 align:middle line:84%
of the toxins in the air
and the toxins in the water

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:21.527 align:middle line:84%
and the toxins people are
exposed to on a daily basis --

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:22.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yep.

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:25.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- that's what
causes these health situations

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:26.532 align:middle line:90%
and these health problems.

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: This is a crucial
point, and I hope all

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.536 align:middle line:84%
of you watching understand
this, that, you see,

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.004 align:middle line:90%
this may be the company

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:34.873 align:middle line:84%
that first created
this blue food dye.

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:38.711 align:middle line:84%
They may have tested this one
chemical in isolation and found

00:19:38.711 --> 00:19:42.448 align:middle line:84%
that this one chemical by
itself probably won't kill you,

00:19:42.448 --> 00:19:46.418 align:middle line:84%
but no one is taking these
chemicals in isolation.

00:19:46.418 --> 00:19:47.586 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: They're eating
literally hundreds

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:48.687 align:middle line:90%
of different chemicals.

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:50.656 align:middle line:84%
We haven't even covered
the sodium benzoate,

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:53.392 align:middle line:84%
the chemical additives,
preservatives, the GMO's,

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:56.595 align:middle line:84%
the glyphosate, the heavy
metals that are in foods,

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.664 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to talk
about in another episode here

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:03.636 align:middle line:84%
on GAIAM TV, but they -- nobody
tests these in combination.

00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:06.438 align:middle line:84%
So the average person before
they leave their house

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:08.941 align:middle line:84%
in the morning they have
already exposed themselves

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:12.478 align:middle line:90%
to over 250 synthetic chemicals.

00:20:12.478 --> 00:20:13.879 align:middle line:84%
And there are somewhere
in the neighborhood

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:17.883 align:middle line:84%
of 80,000 synthetic chemicals
that are legal to use in foods

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:21.854 align:middle line:84%
and cosmetics and personal care
products today, many of which,

00:20:21.854 --> 00:20:25.624 align:middle line:84%
most of which, actually have
never been tested for safety

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:27.293 align:middle line:90%
and have never been approved

00:20:27.293 --> 00:20:30.596 align:middle line:84%
by any safety standard,
not even by the FDA.

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: That's right.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.432 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this stuff
causes massive damage

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:34.833 align:middle line:90%
in the intestinal lining too.

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:36.735 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, all
these toxins that come

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.872 align:middle line:84%
in ultimately effect
the intestines first,

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:43.142 align:middle line:84%
and we wonder why we have
so many intestinal problems;

00:20:43.142 --> 00:20:45.878 align:middle line:84%
constipation, irritable
bowel, you know.

00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:49.848 align:middle line:84%
And over a period of time these
things actually cause damage

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:52.985 align:middle line:84%
and inflammation to
the intestinal lining

00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:54.753 align:middle line:90%
and can even burn tiny holes

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:57.556 align:middle line:84%
through the intestinal lining
causing leaky gut syndrome.

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:59.191 align:middle line:90%
When that happens --

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:00.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, boy.

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:00.893 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: --
undigested proteins --

00:21:00.893 --> 00:21:02.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yep.

00:21:02.194 --> 00:21:03.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- undigested
foods, toxins, chemicals,

00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:07.766 align:middle line:84%
leak into the bloodstream and
cause a massive immune response.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:10.502 align:middle line:84%
And people wonder why
they're tired all the time.

00:21:10.502 --> 00:21:12.404 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Mike, look at
this for breakfast.

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:17.009 align:middle line:84%
Okay. What happens when the kids
eat a glass of milk with this,

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:19.678 align:middle line:84%
have, you know, store-bought
orange juice

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:90%
for breakfast in the morning?

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.549 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're putting all
these liquids on top of this.

00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:27.586 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take all the
chemicals on these labels

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:32.057 align:middle line:84%
and mix them up into a
beaker or into a pot and give

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:34.426 align:middle line:84%
that to somebody, how many
people do you think would

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:90%
drink that?

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:35.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh yeah.

00:21:35.728 --> 00:21:37.129 align:middle line:90%
I know, it's crazy.

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:84%
But look, food is the problem to
the epidemic of chronic disease

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.535 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing all across
the nation and everywhere

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:46.138 align:middle line:84%
around the world that starts
to eat these kinds of foods.

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:90%
But food is also the solution,

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.809 align:middle line:84%
because real food gives
you real nutrition

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:52.144 align:middle line:90%
that helps your body heal.

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:53.912 align:middle line:84%
Right. So if you get
real blueberries --

00:21:53.912 --> 00:21:56.215 align:middle line:84%
and we have some of those
here -- that we're --

00:21:56.215 --> 00:21:57.149 align:middle line:90%
I can kind of show you.

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:58.484 align:middle line:90%
They're kind of small.

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But real blueberries have
real nutrition, real medicine.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.888 align:middle line:84%
This is what you're
supposed to be eating.

00:22:02.888 --> 00:22:03.989 align:middle line:84%
Now you know why
we're wearing gloves,

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.724 align:middle line:84%
so we can actually
show you these things.

00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:08.727 align:middle line:90%
But fake food is anti-food.

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:11.964 align:middle line:84%
Fake food actually pulls the
nutrition out of your body

00:22:11.964 --> 00:22:14.066 align:middle line:84%
for you to detox that
out of your system.

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:17.536 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the fake
ingredients will actually pull

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:18.904 align:middle line:90%
minerals out.

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:22.474 align:middle line:84%
You will expend antioxidants
in fighting the free radicals

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:24.843 align:middle line:84%
that those chemicals
generate in your body.

00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:26.111 align:middle line:90%
So they are anti-foods.

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:28.847 align:middle line:84%
They actually give you
a net loss of nutrition,

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.649 align:middle line:90%
where your mind is thinking oh,

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:31.984 align:middle line:84%
I'm buying these
blueberry muffins.

00:22:31.984 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a net
gain of blueberries.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.055 align:middle line:90%
It's a trick folks.

00:22:36.055 --> 00:22:37.656 align:middle line:90%
It's stage magic.

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:39.024 align:middle line:90%
It's deception.

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:41.093 align:middle line:84%
This is what's diseasing
America.

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:44.396 align:middle line:84%
This is what's killing us all,
through cancer and diabetes

00:22:44.396 --> 00:22:47.032 align:middle line:84%
and heart disease and
Alzheimer's and kidney stones.

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.934 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to change
this, Ed, if we're going

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:51.103 align:middle line:84%
to change the future of
our nation and our world.

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:52.204 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:53.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely.

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:55.908 align:middle line:84%
And change happens now and
it happens with our children.

00:22:55.908 --> 00:22:59.912 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about as easy
as understanding what's

00:22:59.912 --> 00:23:02.648 align:middle line:84%
in your foods and
watching out for symptoms.

00:23:02.648 --> 00:23:03.982 align:middle line:90%
I mean, listen to your body.

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:05.918 align:middle line:84%
Your body will always
tell you everything.

00:23:05.918 --> 00:23:08.487 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just some of the
symptoms that you have

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:11.723 align:middle line:84%
from eating this type of food
are headaches, dizziness,

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:17.029 align:middle line:84%
hyperactivity, bloating, gas,
headaches, severe headaches.

00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Skin disorders.

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:18.363 align:middle line:90%
Rashes.

00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:18.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Skin disorders.

00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:19.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yep.

00:23:19.364 --> 00:23:20.065 align:middle line:90%
Eczema.

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.433 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: You know,

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:22.568 align:middle line:84%
the thing is your intestines
are made of epithelial tissue

00:23:22.568 --> 00:23:25.237 align:middle line:84%
and your skin is made
of epithelial tissue.

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Your intestines are basically
your skin turned inside out.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.844 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever touches
your intestines always comes

00:23:31.844 --> 00:23:32.845 align:middle line:90%
out through your skin.

00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:34.246 align:middle line:84%
That's your body's
way of telling you

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:36.415 align:middle line:90%
that something is wrong.

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:39.017 align:middle line:84%
And if you have toxins
in your intestines,

00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:40.686 align:middle line:90%
you might have skin breakouts.

00:23:40.686 --> 00:23:42.087 align:middle line:90%
You might have skin rashes.

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:84%
You might have exacerbations
of psoriasis,

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:48.026 align:middle line:84%
eczema and everything else
that you're dealing with as far

00:23:48.026 --> 00:23:49.561 align:middle line:90%
as your skin is concerned, so.

00:23:49.561 --> 00:23:52.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: This is crucial because
the model of Western medicine

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.933 align:middle line:84%
and Western diets that
we're dealing with today,

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:57.269 align:middle line:90%
the model is eat toxic foods

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:59.538 align:middle line:84%
that give you symptoms
of disease.

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:00.372 align:middle line:90%
Go to the doctor.

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:02.007 align:middle line:90%
Get a diagnosis for the symptom

00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and then take prescription
medications

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.278 align:middle line:90%
to cover up that symptom.

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:07.546 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you got a skin rash.

00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:90%
There's a drug.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.882 align:middle line:90%
You know, there's cortisol.

00:24:09.882 --> 00:24:11.884 align:middle line:84%
There's antihistamines
for other symptoms.

00:24:11.884 --> 00:24:14.453 align:middle line:84%
There's arthritis drugs
to cover up the joint pain

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:17.189 align:middle line:84%
that can be caused by
undigested uric acid crystals,

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:18.357 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:24:18.357 --> 00:24:20.158 align:middle line:90%
It's an insane system folks.

00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:90%
It's an insane system.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.561 align:middle line:90%
I know you agree, Ed.

00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:24.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well, we live in
a system, a healthcare system,

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:26.265 align:middle line:90%
that's getting worse and worse,

00:24:26.265 --> 00:24:31.003 align:middle line:84%
and doctors are addressing
the symptoms instead

00:24:31.003 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:90%
of the root cause.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.704 align:middle line:90%
I mean, --

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:33.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:34.506 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: --
we've seen and worked

00:24:34.506 --> 00:24:35.841 align:middle line:90%
with thousands of patients.

00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.543 align:middle line:84%
And once you switch them and
get rid of all the chemicals

00:24:37.543 --> 00:24:40.579 align:middle line:84%
in their life, those are
what's causing all this.

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:42.548 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are the things
that are causing heart disease,

00:24:42.548 --> 00:24:44.049 align:middle line:90%
diabetes and everything else.

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:47.019 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, what are
some of the solutions,

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:48.053 align:middle line:90%
some easy solutions --

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:49.454 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:24:49.454 --> 00:24:52.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- that you see
that you recommend people do?

00:24:52.124 --> 00:24:53.592 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Let's get to
some solutions but, first,

00:24:53.592 --> 00:24:56.528 align:middle line:84%
I've got to ask you, would you
eat this for a hundred bucks?

00:24:56.528 --> 00:24:57.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I would
not eat it.

00:24:57.729 --> 00:25:00.732 align:middle line:84%
But if I ate it for $100,
I'd probably, you know,

00:25:00.732 --> 00:25:03.502 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably eat something
to neutralize after that.

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:06.338 align:middle line:84%
But actually it's not --
you couldn't pay me $100 --

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:07.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: I know.

00:25:07.406 --> 00:25:08.807 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- to
eat that, seriously.

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:10.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Another reason we're
both wearing gloves, honestly,

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.578 align:middle line:84%
is because we don't want to
touch this stuff, which is --

00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:13.979 align:middle line:84%
some of it will absorb
through your skin.

00:25:13.979 --> 00:25:16.448 align:middle line:84%
I don't want these dyes
going through my skin.

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:17.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I know.

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:18.784 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you
investigate this stuff

00:25:18.784 --> 00:25:21.153 align:middle line:84%
and you actually start learning,
I mean, take one thing --

00:25:21.153 --> 00:25:23.388 align:middle line:84%
and this is a challenge
to everybody.

00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:27.793 align:middle line:84%
Take one thing off of any
label you have in your cabinet

00:25:27.793 --> 00:25:30.495 align:middle line:84%
in your kitchen and do the
research online and put

00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:32.764 align:middle line:84%
that ingredient in
and put carcinogen,

00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:35.767 align:middle line:84%
which means cancer-causing,
or put toxic or dangers

00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:37.302 align:middle line:90%
of this ingredient and see --

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:38.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:25:38.136 --> 00:25:38.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: -- what comes up.

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:39.204 align:middle line:90%
I mean --

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:39.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:41.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: -- it's --

00:25:41.273 --> 00:25:41.974 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find mostly
the same ingredients on a lot

00:25:41.974 --> 00:25:42.741 align:middle line:90%
of different foods, but.

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:43.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It's incredible.

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:84%
But like you said, let's
get to some solution.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.745 align:middle line:90%
So solution Number One.

00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:47.613 align:middle line:90%
This is the easiest one.

00:25:47.613 --> 00:25:48.647 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you.

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:90%
It's called reading the label.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.951 align:middle line:90%
You simply read the label.

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:56.421 align:middle line:84%
I know some of the text
font size is microscopic.

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:59.625 align:middle line:84%
Get a magnifying glass if you
have to, but read the label.

00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:00.993 align:middle line:90%
Number One.

00:26:00.993 --> 00:26:04.796 align:middle line:84%
If you come across a lot of
chemicals and food colors,

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:08.567 align:middle line:84%
like red number forty, blue
number one, blue number two,

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:11.903 align:middle line:84%
green, yellow, and so on,
avoid the food completely.

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:13.338 align:middle line:90%
Right. If you see chemicals,

00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:84%
you don't understand
what those chemicals are,

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.541 align:middle line:90%
you probably shouldn't eat that.

00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:17.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely.

00:26:17.643 --> 00:26:19.711 align:middle line:84%
And solution Number
Two is avoid anything

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:22.447 align:middle line:90%
that contains corn or soy.

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:26.084 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the list goes on,
unless it's certified organic.

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:26.618 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: [inaudible] organic.

00:26:26.618 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Because soy and
corn are genetically modified,

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:33.759 align:middle line:84%
which tune into GAIAM for our
show on GMO's, which is going

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:34.760 align:middle line:90%
to be an awesome show.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.861 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, yeah.

00:26:35.861 --> 00:26:37.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So those
are a couple things.

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:39.631 align:middle line:84%
And then I think solution three
we both agree on, is just switch

00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:84%
to an organic diet,
I mean, because,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.503 align:middle line:84%
if you buy certified
organic, you're going

00:26:44.503 --> 00:26:45.871 align:middle line:90%
to be getting good food.

00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, I think also
part of the solution is to look

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.942 align:middle line:84%
for foods that you
physically, visually recognize.

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:53.745 align:middle line:84%
If you're buying blueberries to
get the benefit of blueberries

00:26:53.745 --> 00:26:55.881 align:middle line:84%
or strawberries or
what have you,

00:26:55.881 --> 00:26:58.850 align:middle line:84%
make sure you can actually
see the blueberries,

00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:59.918 align:middle line:90%
like I'm holding here.

00:26:59.918 --> 00:27:01.586 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you can
see the strawberries.

00:27:01.586 --> 00:27:04.756 align:middle line:84%
Why not -- if you want to
make a blueberry muffin,

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:08.627 align:middle line:84%
why not get your own
gluten-free organic muffin mix,

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:09.895 align:middle line:84%
get some freeze dried
blueberries,

00:27:09.895 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:84%
put them in the mix
and make your own?

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: But Mike, organic
food is too expensive for me.

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:16.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, man.

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: What do
you say about that?

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, you know what's
really expensive folks is being

00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:22.274 align:middle line:84%
sick for the rest of your
life, and that's what happens

00:27:22.274 --> 00:27:24.042 align:middle line:90%
when you eat fake foods.

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:26.078 align:middle line:84%
If you do the numbers, Ed,
and I know we've talked

00:27:26.078 --> 00:27:28.914 align:middle line:84%
about this before, if you
look at the economics of it,

00:27:28.914 --> 00:27:33.485 align:middle line:84%
investing in natural
foods is cheap insurance.

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:35.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the best value
for your dollar

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.824 align:middle line:84%
because you avoid the hospitals,
you avoid the medications,

00:27:38.824 --> 00:27:42.027 align:middle line:84%
you spend your years of
happiness, time with family,

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:44.396 align:middle line:84%
quality living, all
of those things.

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:46.198 align:middle line:84%
It's the best investment
you could make.

00:27:46.198 --> 00:27:47.833 align:middle line:90%
And I also got to say, Ed,

00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:50.635 align:middle line:84%
it's the best investment
we could make as a nation.

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:51.803 align:middle line:90%
You know, there's all this talk

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:54.372 align:middle line:84%
about free health
insurance, free health care.

00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:57.342 align:middle line:84%
We should -- you know, all your
disease cost should be covered.

00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:59.878 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we talking about
getting people healthy

00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:03.515 align:middle line:84%
with real food instead of
who pays for their disease?

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.285 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and what we didn't
even talk about is the impact

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:09.454 align:middle line:84%
on the environment
that this food has.

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:10.088 align:middle line:90%
I mean --

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:11.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, yeah.

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:12.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- when you
talk about the production

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:14.726 align:middle line:84%
of these synthetic
chemicals on the environment,

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:17.329 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff goes out
through your fecal matter.

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:19.030 align:middle line:90%
It goes out through your urine.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.367 align:middle line:84%
It goes into the water
system, I mean, you know.

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:23.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Well, you're assuming

00:28:23.602 --> 00:28:25.303 align:middle line:84%
that the people is actually
do have bowel movements,

00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:26.638 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not so sure about that.

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:29.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And the medical
profession says it's safe

00:28:29.141 --> 00:28:31.877 align:middle line:84%
if you have one bowel
movement per week.

00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:33.178 align:middle line:90%
One to two bowel movements --

00:28:33.178 --> 00:28:34.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: No.

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:35.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- per week
is considered normal.

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:35.614 align:middle line:90%
I know. It's crazy.

00:28:35.614 --> 00:28:36.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Okay.

00:28:36.047 --> 00:28:37.082 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:38.316 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Look
at the animal world.

00:28:38.316 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:84%
They -- how many bowel
movements those guys have --

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:39.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:40.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: -- all the time.

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:41.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Let's save that for --

00:28:41.353 --> 00:28:42.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: So.

00:28:42.154 --> 00:28:43.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: -- a different show

00:28:43.155 --> 00:28:43.789 align:middle line:84%
because you're starting
to gross me out.

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:45.190 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.225 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this stuff, eventually,
it's going to pass through you.

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:48.326 align:middle line:90%
Where does it go?

00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:49.394 align:middle line:90%
It goes down the drain.

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:52.297 align:middle line:84%
It goes into the
sewage processing plant,

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:53.565 align:middle line:90%
gets turned into what?

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:54.966 align:middle line:90%
Human bio-solids.

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.434 align:middle line:90%
Which is used where?

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:59.838 align:middle line:84%
As fertilizer on more
crops to grow more foods

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that are stripped of their
vitamins and minerals

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.810 align:middle line:84%
to make process refined
enriched wheat flour

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.945 align:middle line:84%
with fake blueberries
that you then eat again.

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:08.079 align:middle line:90%
You get it?

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:11.249 align:middle line:84%
You're eating your own
stuff, recycled food,

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:13.118 align:middle line:84%
with chemicals added
over and over again.

00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:14.352 align:middle line:84%
It's worse than being
an astronaut

00:29:14.352 --> 00:29:16.721 align:middle line:84%
on the space shuttle
drinking your own pee.

00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:17.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: [inaudible]
actually pee is more

00:29:17.823 --> 00:29:19.491 align:middle line:84%
and it probably even
more healthy for you.

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:20.759 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It's filtered,
you know.

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:23.094 align:middle line:84%
I would rather drink astronaut
pee than eat this stuff.

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:24.229 align:middle line:90%
I'm serious.

00:29:24.229 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I hear you.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.165 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's -- you
know, if you really want

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:31.703 align:middle line:84%
to address the health care,
it needs to start at home.

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:33.305 align:middle line:90%
It needs to start on the shelf.

00:29:33.305 --> 00:29:35.006 align:middle line:90%
There needs to be restrictions.

00:29:35.006 --> 00:29:37.709 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, what do
you think about labeling?

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:39.845 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just think if you had --

00:29:39.845 --> 00:29:43.248 align:middle line:84%
like in the UK, it must
be labeled; warning.

00:29:43.248 --> 00:29:45.817 align:middle line:84%
This food contains
artificial dyes --

00:29:45.817 --> 00:29:47.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:48.486 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- which are
known to be a carcinogen.

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:50.522 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have any of
that in the United States.

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:51.423 align:middle line:90%
We don't have anybody.

00:29:51.423 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Do you --

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: I know.

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:54.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- think
someone would buy this

00:29:54.192 --> 00:29:55.227 align:middle line:84%
if there was a big
warning signal on here

00:29:55.227 --> 00:29:56.995 align:middle line:84%
that said this food
may cause cancer?

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:58.196 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, look,
they require warnings

00:29:58.196 --> 00:30:01.032 align:middle line:84%
on cigarette packs,
which I agree with.

00:30:01.032 --> 00:30:02.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: They require
warnings on pharmaceuticals,

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:03.735 align:middle line:90%
you know, black box warnings.

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:04.703 align:middle line:90%
This drug might kill you.

00:30:04.703 --> 00:30:05.537 align:middle line:90%
Take it anyway.

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:06.638 align:middle line:90%
People do and they die.

00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:08.373 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but at least
the warning is there.

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:09.541 align:middle line:90%
They have a choice.

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:11.076 align:middle line:84%
But there's no warnings
on the food.

00:30:11.076 --> 00:30:12.410 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right, Ed.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:13.612 align:middle line:90%
There should be warnings;

00:30:13.612 --> 00:30:15.847 align:middle line:84%
contains artificial
petrochemicals

00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:17.415 align:middle line:90%
that are carcinogenic.

00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:18.984 align:middle line:84%
In fact, isn't there
a law in this country

00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:20.452 align:middle line:84%
that if something
causes cancer you have

00:30:20.452 --> 00:30:22.153 align:middle line:84%
to put a cancer warning
on the box?

00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:24.956 align:middle line:84%
Where are the cancer
warnings on all these fake --

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:26.424 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
real right here,

00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:27.525 align:middle line:90%
so we can't blame them, but.

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well,
semi-real, I would say.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.328 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah, semi-real.

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:31.963 align:middle line:84%
But you know, all these fake
products and the fake serials

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:33.732 align:middle line:84%
that we showed you,
where are the warnings

00:30:33.732 --> 00:30:35.433 align:middle line:90%
about the artificial colors?

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:37.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And why aren't
doctors trained in this?

00:30:37.903 --> 00:30:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean --

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:39.871 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: -- weird.

00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:41.072 align:middle line:90%
You rely on your doctor.

00:30:41.072 --> 00:30:42.407 align:middle line:84%
When you go into
the doctor's office

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:43.708 align:middle line:90%
to tell you why you're sick,

00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:46.278 align:middle line:84%
doctors should be taught
this stuff in school, Mike.

00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:47.178 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you --

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:47.679 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:48.713 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:30:48.713 --> 00:30:50.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It's
[multiple speakers].

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:51.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, the average
doctor spends only about what,

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:52.550 align:middle line:84%
an hour, classroom hour
learning about nutrition?

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:53.251 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:54.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:30:54.653 --> 00:30:56.554 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: But anyway, we want to
thank you all for watching this.

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:57.889 align:middle line:90%

It's only going to benefit

It's only going to
reduce the trips

to the doctor over
the long haul.

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:42.534 align:middle line:84%
Become educated about
your foods.

00:31:42.534 --> 00:31:43.768 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Mike.

00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:45.170 align:middle line:84%
