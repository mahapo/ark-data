noticed I'm wearing a chemical

we're dealing

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:37.705 align:middle line:84%
with a very dangerous toxic
element known as-- what Ed?

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:38.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Fluoride.

00:00:38.873 --> 00:00:40.608 align:middle line:90%
And in order to handle fluoride,

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
you have to be in
a protective suit.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.547 align:middle line:84%
Although, everybody is exposed
to fluoride on a daily basis

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.182 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
going to talk about today,

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:51.152 align:middle line:84%
but first before Mike
burns up in his suit,

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:52.987 align:middle line:84%
I think we should
do a demonstration,

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:57.224 align:middle line:84%
Mike is taking the time to
get a fluoride test meter

00:00:57.224 --> 00:01:00.361 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
demonstrate how much fluoride is

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:04.130 align:middle line:84%
in this water right here
which is actually fed

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.799 align:middle line:90%
to infants and babies.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:06.667 align:middle line:90%
Mike it's crazy.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:07.801 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Let's do it.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.236 align:middle line:84%
But first, let me
explain to folks out there

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.538 align:middle line:90%
who are watching them.

00:01:10.538 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I think this is over kill
but it turns out, you know,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.211 align:middle line:84%
the chemical weapons used
in Syria not too long ago?

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:21.649 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to the British
press, a raw material used

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.618 align:middle line:84%
to make chemical weapons
was allowed to be exported

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:27.754 align:middle line:84%
by the British government
to Syria.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.156 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look at
the press reports,

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:34.728 align:middle line:84%
that raw material was nothing
other than sodium fluoride.

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:37.164 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Group: The same
stuff that's rat poison?

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:38.299 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.202 align:middle line:84%
It's also the same stuff
that's put into products

00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:45.573 align:middle line:84%
such as toothpaste, mouthwash,
and even a baby water product

00:01:45.573 --> 00:01:48.141 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to test
right here on camera.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:50.477 align:middle line:84%
But it's just important
for people to note

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:52.613 align:middle line:84%
that you can take
sodium fluoride,

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:56.917 align:middle line:84%
you can use that to make a
deadly nerve gas poison known

00:01:56.917 --> 00:02:01.422 align:middle line:84%
as sarin gas which was actually
created by Nazi scientists, Ed.

00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:04.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It's amazing
that it's in our water supply

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.827 align:middle line:84%
and it's in all kinds of
prescription medications,

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:11.465 align:middle line:84%
and even since the 1939 when
fluoride was first introduced

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.167 align:middle line:84%
into the water system,
it was introduced

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:17.538 align:middle line:84%
in the Nazi concentration camps
because it calmed people down

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:19.607 align:middle line:84%
and it made them
lethargic and they were able

00:02:19.607 --> 00:02:22.843 align:middle line:84%
to control people better
and reduce their aggression.

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:24.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Making them docile.

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:25.812 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's go
ahead with the test here.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:28.415 align:middle line:84%
So, the first thing we're
going to do is we're going

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:30.751 align:middle line:84%
to actually calibrate
our fluoride tester.

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.889 align:middle line:84%
This is a calibrated fluoride
liquid containing exactly 1 part

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.458 align:middle line:90%
per million of fluoride.

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:38.759 align:middle line:90%
We're going to run our test.

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:40.661 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you the zero,
as soon as it's up.

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.997 align:middle line:90%
And this is a pretty quick test

00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:46.267 align:middle line:84%
but it does take a few
seconds, Ed, so there we go.

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:48.969 align:middle line:84%
Let me show the viewers,
we are now calibrated

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.806 align:middle line:84%
at zero parts per
million, right here.

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:90%
And this test is fairly precise

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.246 align:middle line:84%
so we can actually do
exactly what we want here.

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:01.749 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to take
the fluoridated water.

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:03.117 align:middle line:90%
It's called nursery water.

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:06.654 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take a
very precise pipe header

00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:90%
at the pipe pet, we're going

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.862 align:middle line:84%
to take 10 milliliters
of water-- I'm sorry.

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:17.431 align:middle line:84%

hard for you to see there--

>> Mike: This is a tough job.

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:22.436 align:middle line:84%
All right, actually we're
going to take 8 milliliters

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:24.872 align:middle line:84%
and then 2 milliliters
of reagent.

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I feel sorry
for the guys who have

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:29.176 align:middle line:84%
to actually carry and
hold that toxic fluoride

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:32.211 align:middle line:84%
and those suits all day dumping
it into the public water system.

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:33.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: I know, exactly.

00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:34.648 align:middle line:90%
This is a tough job.

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:35.916 align:middle line:90%
But now we're going to take--

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:40.821 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, over here is
our reagent which is going

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:44.258 align:middle line:84%
to help us detect the actual
fluoride level in this product.

00:03:44.258 --> 00:03:45.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Need some
help with that buddy?

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:47.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yes, please, thank you.

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Now this reagent is
safe for you to handle

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.231 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
contain any fluoride.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:58.205 align:middle line:84%
And we get 2 milliliters,
thanks you, into our sample.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.408 align:middle line:90%
Here's our sample.

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.511 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to take
our sample and we're going

00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:09.983 align:middle line:84%
to run the test on that using
our calibrated fluoride meter.

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.418 align:middle line:90%

>> Mike: Oh, they're done now.

00:04:13.354 --> 00:04:17.091 align:middle line:90%
All right, there we go.

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:20.928 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put in the

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:24.231 align:middle line:84%
We're going to press read and
I'll show you the results here

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:31.605 align:middle line:84%
as they come up and then we'll
be able to see-- there we go.

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:32.973 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Wow.

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:36.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: 2 over 2 parts per
million is what this meter is

00:04:36.477 --> 00:04:39.046 align:middle line:84%
saying, over 2 parts
per million.

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.614 align:middle line:90%
The flashing means it's over 2

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:43.817 align:middle line:84%
because 2 is the detection
limit of this meter.

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Now this product, this
baby water product says

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.856 align:middle line:84%
that it contains
1 part per million

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:50.958 align:middle line:90%
of fluoride-- sodium fluoride.

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:55.629 align:middle line:84%
This meter is reading 2,
there might be some variation

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
or this-- who knows, maybe
this meter is reading too much

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.535 align:middle line:84%
or maybe there's too much in
there, we don't know for sure

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:02.803 align:middle line:90%
until we do more test.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:05.939 align:middle line:84%
But, they both agree that
there is sodium fluoride

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.009 align:middle line:84%
in this baby water product
and it is well known

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.678 align:middle line:84%
that sodium fluoride
is an ingredient

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:14.314 align:middle line:84%
that can be use to
make nerve gas.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.682 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: That's amazing.

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.485 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's-- you know, it's
just amazing that they allow

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.921 align:middle line:84%
so much fluoride to
be put in the water

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:24.625 align:middle line:84%
and it's the more research
that I do and that we do,

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:28.495 align:middle line:84%
we just find that it's
overwhelmingly shocking

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:32.366 align:middle line:84%
that there is so much
Fluoride in pharmaceuticals,

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:35.369 align:middle line:84%
Prozac for example contains a
fluoride compound, but I know--

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:36.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike. Yeah.

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:37.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- you're
getting hot in your suit Mike,

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:38.639 align:middle line:84%
so let's get you
out of that suit

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.274 align:middle line:84%
and then we can start
having fun in talking

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:43.243 align:middle line:84%
about letting people know
how they can avoid fluoride

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:44.445 align:middle line:90%
from household items.

00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:45.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: All right, that
sounds like a great idea.

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:46.914 align:middle line:84%
I think the CO2 level
in the suit is

00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:48.815 align:middle line:84%
about at 10,000 parts
per million.

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.051 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have to
catch even passing out.

00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:51.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I'm going to
get out of this suit

00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:52.820 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be right back

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.122 align:middle line:84%
to continue telling
you more information

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:57.291 align:middle line:84%
about sodium fluoride
and how to avoid it

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:58.258 align:middle line:90%
so that you have solution.

00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:00.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: So, welcome back.

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:04.031 align:middle line:84%
We're here today talking about
fluoride toxicity and you know,

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:08.569 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people don't even
know where fluoride comes from

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.973 align:middle line:84%
but fluorine is actually
a halogen with chlorine

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:15.309 align:middle line:90%
and bromine and iodine.

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:19.246 align:middle line:84%
Now the toxic form of fluoride
was actually a byproduct

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:22.349 align:middle line:84%
of aluminum manufacturing,
steel manufacturing,

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:27.588 align:middle line:84%
nuclear manufacturing, back
in the early 1930s and 1940s.

00:06:27.588 --> 00:06:29.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And it's just-- it's
important for people to note

00:06:29.823 --> 00:06:35.796 align:middle line:84%
that this is a naturally
occurring mineral in the soil.

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:39.967 align:middle line:84%
But, when it's refined and
extracted and taken out,

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.568 align:middle line:90%
it can become poisonous.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:45.606 align:middle line:84%
So, a lot of wells for example
are contaminated with fluoride.

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:48.475 align:middle line:84%
It's a contaminant when
you take it in too much.

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:51.512 align:middle line:84%
So, I just want to make sure
that people know that it's not

00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:54.114 align:middle line:84%
like these factories are
creating the fluoride,

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:58.852 align:middle line:84%
they're actually emitting
it from mining operations.

00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:00.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:02.456 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened was
they had such an excess of it

00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:05.659 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't know what to do
with it all and then originally,

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.327 align:middle line:84%
it was going into
the air and it was--

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:08.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:09.763 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- killing of all
the livestock and it was killing

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.799 align:middle line:84%
of all the farm and
agricultural land.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:15.435 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
lawsuit against Alcoa,

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.037 align:middle line:90%
which was Aluminum Company

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:18.906 align:middle line:84%
and the byproduct
was sodium fluoride

00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:21.141 align:middle line:84%
and they had actually
start collecting it

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:84%
because it was poisoning
the land.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, and phosphate
mining for fertilizer,

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.083 align:middle line:84%
phospate mining produces
fluoride as a byproduct again

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:32.553 align:middle line:90%
because it's in the soil.

00:07:32.553 --> 00:07:35.022 align:middle line:84%
So, that was causing
the same problem.

00:07:35.022 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
It was killing wildlife so
they needed a way to get rid

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.295 align:middle line:84%
of the fluoride and there're
really only two ways to get rid

00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:45.265 align:middle line:84%
of it if you're a mining company
or an aluminum smelting company.

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:49.603 align:middle line:84%
You can either, A, use EPA
guidelines to dispose of it

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:54.007 align:middle line:84%
as a toxic hazardous waste
or, B, you can convince people

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:84%
to buy it and put
it in their water

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.744 align:middle line:84%
which is what cities
are now doing.

00:07:57.744 --> 00:08:01.114 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they get
rid of sodium fluoride.

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:03.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yes it would
have caused billions of dollars

00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:08.355 align:middle line:84%
to be able to remove
that toxic compound

00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:10.023 align:middle line:84%
from the atmosphere
and fluoride gas.

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:11.325 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just think
of all the people

00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:14.861 align:middle line:84%
that take a shower everyday
with fluoridated water

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
that are actually
breathing that gas.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.231 align:middle line:90%
No one even talks about that.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:22.169 align:middle line:84%
But, they decided to
hire top scientists

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:26.173 align:middle line:84%
to convince the public that
fluoride was going to be safe

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:28.742 align:middle line:84%
so they could put it
in the water supply

00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:30.444 align:middle line:90%
and fluoridate the nation.

00:08:30.444 --> 00:08:32.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Ed, you make a
really good point actually

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:35.215 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking about
water vapor in a shower

00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:37.851 align:middle line:84%
like hot water they
breathing that in.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:40.554 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, it's
not a fluorine gas

00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:42.989 align:middle line:84%
which would kill people
instantly but it is--

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:46.326 align:middle line:84%
it is a water vapor that they
can inhale into their lungs

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:48.829 align:middle line:84%
and then that-- that's
exposure to fluoride.

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:51.999 align:middle line:84%
Now what we just showed with
the lab test that we just did is

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:56.103 align:middle line:84%
that you can then get additional
fluoride exposure from products

00:08:56.103 --> 00:08:57.938 align:middle line:90%
where it is intentionally added.

00:08:57.938 --> 00:09:01.675 align:middle line:84%
Like this nursery water, they're
actually putting fluoride

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:05.579 align:middle line:84%
in this water that's intended
to be given to babies and that's

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:07.414 align:middle line:90%
at about 1 part per million.

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:11.051 align:middle line:84%
This anti-cavity
mouthwash contains Ed,

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.687 align:middle line:90%
500 parts per million fluoride,

00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and then this toothpaste contain
very high levels as well.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.925 align:middle line:84%
We haven't tested them so
we don't know the level

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:22.095 align:middle line:84%
but it could very conceivably
be 500 parts per million

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:24.498 align:middle line:84%
or even a thousand parts
per million sodium fluoride.

00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:27.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And you, even a
long time ago when they came

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:29.036 align:middle line:84%
out with fluoride
toothpaste and everything,

00:09:29.036 --> 00:09:31.672 align:middle line:84%
it was never intended
to be ingested.

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:36.209 align:middle line:84%
It was only intended to be used
as a mouthwash and spit out

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:38.312 align:middle line:90%
or to be put on the teeth

00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:41.748 align:middle line:84%
for addressing dental
carries or dental cavities.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:45.385 align:middle line:84%
Although, it's been proven
now with scientific research

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:48.588 align:middle line:84%
that fluoride actually
damages teeth.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:54.361 align:middle line:84%
We have a 40 percent of all
teenagers right now in America

00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:56.263 align:middle line:90%
that have dental Fluorosis

00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:58.865 align:middle line:84%
that have been raised
on fluoridated water.

00:09:58.865 --> 00:09:59.866 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's a
huge number, Ed.

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:01.168 align:middle line:90%
40 percent.

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
It just really tells you how
big of a problem this is.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you have added fluoride
in products like this baby water

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.976 align:middle line:84%
or this toothpaste
sometimes are swallowed too,

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:13.814 align:middle line:84%
by the way ingested, and many
toothpaste have poison control

00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:15.882 align:middle line:90%
warnings right on the label.

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:17.117 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you
swallow this, you know,

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.819 align:middle line:90%
call the poison control center.

00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:22.422 align:middle line:84%
It turns out there is enough
fluoride in an adult tube

00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:26.326 align:middle line:84%
of toothpaste to kill a child
if they were to actually eat it.

00:10:26.326 --> 00:10:27.761 align:middle line:90%
It's that toxic.

00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:30.764 align:middle line:84%
So, the problem is that
people are being dosed

00:10:30.764 --> 00:10:32.699 align:middle line:84%
with sodium fluoride
through the water supply

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:35.268 align:middle line:84%
and through the supplemental
products even though no one is

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:38.205 align:middle line:84%
testing them for whether
they have high levels

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:41.341 align:middle line:84%
of fluoride causing
dental fluorosis.

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.843 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
know what that causes,

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:44.611 align:middle line:90%
take a look at these pictures.

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:48.315 align:middle line:84%
This is dental fluorosis,
an extreme case, yes.

00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:50.917 align:middle line:84%
But look how damaging
it is to teeth.

00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:52.819 align:middle line:84%
It's extraordinary--
horrifying actually.

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean,
that is just-- that is--

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:56.623 align:middle line:84%
I feel sorry for
that child actually.

00:10:56.623 --> 00:10:57.958 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at that picture.

00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.294 align:middle line:84%
That's just-- you know, that
poor child is going to have

00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:03.663 align:middle line:84%
to grow up and is never
going to have teeth

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:07.033 align:middle line:84%
and fluoride really affects
children's teeth more

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.435 align:middle line:90%
than the adult teeth.

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:10.237 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it really-- when--

00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:12.773 align:middle line:84%
if you can look at your
child's teeth right now

00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:15.308 align:middle line:84%
and you see little white
spots on there or yellow lines

00:11:15.308 --> 00:11:18.678 align:middle line:84%
on there or little brown spots
on there, that's an indication

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:22.983 align:middle line:84%
that that child is starting to
get fluorosis, dental fluorosis.

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:27.087 align:middle line:84%
And another point you made Mike
is the fact that we were taking

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:29.489 align:middle line:90%
about fluoride as a poison.

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:32.626 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride is actually a
prescription medication.

00:11:32.626 --> 00:11:33.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yes.

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:34.227 align:middle line:90%
Yes it is.

00:11:34.227 --> 00:11:37.063 align:middle line:84%
And, by the way, the
fluorosis of the bones

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:40.567 align:middle line:84%
and the teeth is not the only
negative side effect caused

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:42.869 align:middle line:84%
by over exposure
to sodium fluoride.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:46.506 align:middle line:84%
Lower IQ's have now been
statistically linked.

00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:49.109 align:middle line:84%
In scientific studies,
the children

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:51.344 align:middle line:84%
who have the most
fluoride intake

00:11:51.344 --> 00:11:53.146 align:middle line:84%
from naturally occurring
fluoride

00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:56.716 align:middle line:84%
in water wells have
the lowest IQs.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:02.355 align:middle line:84%
So, fluoride is one of those
elements that actually interfere

00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:04.324 align:middle line:84%
with normal cognitive
development.

00:12:04.324 --> 00:12:07.294 align:middle line:90%
It makes kids damn down

00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
or cognitively impaired is
probably the correct term

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.965 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:12:11.965 --> 00:12:13.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So Mike-- I
mean, it's just amazing to me

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's shocking when I do
the research and I look back

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.039 align:middle line:84%
and trace the history
of fluoride.

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:21.541 align:middle line:84%
And anybody could do this,
just go online and do it.

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't have to
believe what we're saying.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.612 align:middle line:84%
We want you to do
the research on this.

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:30.016 align:middle line:84%
We want you to go because the
more information that you have,

00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:32.152 align:middle line:84%
the better you and your
family is going to be.

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:35.822 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at what
originally fluoride was used for

00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:37.791 align:middle line:84%
and how it was used in
the concentration camps

00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:41.495 align:middle line:84%
in Nazi Germany, in
Russian concentration camps.

00:12:41.495 --> 00:12:44.464 align:middle line:84%
It was used for one purpose
and one purpose only, Mike,

00:12:44.464 --> 00:12:47.234 align:middle line:84%
and that was to control
the population

00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:50.070 align:middle line:84%
to decrease the aggressiveness
of the people.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I want to just add
to that because it sounds

00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:54.341 align:middle line:84%
like an urban myth if you're
hearing this information

00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:55.508 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:58.011 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking that
couldn't possibly be true.

00:12:58.011 --> 00:12:59.846 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like a myth.

00:12:59.846 --> 00:13:01.982 align:middle line:84%
But, you heard of
sarin gas right?

00:13:01.982 --> 00:13:04.851 align:middle line:84%
That's the gas that was used
on the Japanese subway attack.

00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:09.055 align:middle line:84%
That's the gas used eligibly
by in Syria, sarin gas.

00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:11.091 align:middle line:84%
But you know how sarin
gas got his name, Ed?

00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:15.262 align:middle line:84%
Sarin is the-- it's a
combination of the letters

00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:18.598 align:middle line:84%
of the names of the
four German scientists

00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:22.302 align:middle line:84%
who developed sarin gas
under the Hitler regime.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:90%
So-- And they used fluoride

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.307 align:middle line:84%
as their first element
of sarin gas.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:31.978 align:middle line:84%
In fact, sarin gas has only five
basic elements in it, oxygen,

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:36.783 align:middle line:84%
phosphorus, nitrogen, and
one other plus fluorine.

00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:39.252 align:middle line:84%
And all four out of the
five are completely harmless

00:13:39.252 --> 00:13:40.654 align:middle line:90%
in common in the human body.

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:42.656 align:middle line:90%
Fluorine is the toxic element.

00:13:42.656 --> 00:13:44.858 align:middle line:84%
So, if you really
look at history, Ed,

00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:46.126 align:middle line:90%
it goes back to sarin gas.

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:47.961 align:middle line:90%
It goes back to Nazi Germany.

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And, if you look at
the table of elements

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.799 align:middle line:84%
as you mentioned
earlier, the column of--

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
where fluorine is located, right
below fluorine is chlorine,

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.872 align:middle line:90%
right below chlorine is bromine,

00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:01.074 align:middle line:84%
and right below bromine
is iodine.

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:03.843 align:middle line:84%
And this helps explain
why fluoride interferes

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.846 align:middle line:84%
with iodine absorption and I
like you to talk about that,

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.649 align:middle line:84%
why iodine is so
important for human health

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:11.351 align:middle line:84%
and how fluoride
interferes with it.

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Well, yes.

00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's extremely
important.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.789 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about that
when we get to some

00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:17.891 align:middle line:84%
of the solutions
here pretty soon.

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:21.361 align:middle line:84%
But another thing I want to talk
about is the fact that fluorides

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:25.465 align:middle line:84%
in prescription medications and
fluoride has never been approved

00:14:25.465 --> 00:14:27.734 align:middle line:84%
by the FDA to go into
the water supply.

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:30.236 align:middle line:84%
It's been approved as a
prescription medication.

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:31.271 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's right.

00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:33.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So,
it's strange to see

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:36.009 align:middle line:84%
that if they're adding a
prescription medication

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:37.444 align:middle line:90%
to all the water supplies.

00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:84%
But, only in the
US it seems like--

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.249 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the majority of water
fluoridation is in the US.

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:44.784 align:middle line:90%
If you look at Europe,

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:48.121 align:middle line:84%
98 percent of Western Europe
is not even fluoridated.

00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:49.656 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, let
me add to that.

00:14:49.656 --> 00:14:52.425 align:middle line:84%
If you look at where these
cities are buying their sodium

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:55.562 align:middle line:84%
fluoride to dump in to the water
supply, it's quite shocking.

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:59.165 align:middle line:84%
We did an in-depth investigation
on that at Natural News.

00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:00.433 align:middle line:90%
Check out this photo.

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:84%
This is a container
full of sodium fluoride,

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.773 align:middle line:84%
packed in bags that's
about to be exported

00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:09.109 align:middle line:84%
from chemical factories
in China.

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:11.544 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is imported
into the United States,

00:15:11.544 --> 00:15:13.079 align:middle line:90%
dumped in the water supply.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:16.282 align:middle line:84%
The problem is it's not
just sodium fluoride.

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:18.385 align:middle line:90%
Early tests are already showing

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:22.322 align:middle line:84%
that this so-called fluoride
contains heavy metals

00:15:22.322 --> 00:15:25.325 align:middle line:84%
such as cadmium, lead,
mercury, arsenic,

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:28.895 align:middle line:84%
and even other lighter
elements possibly including tin,

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:30.597 align:middle line:90%
copper, and aluminum.

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:32.966 align:middle line:84%
So, the sodium fluoride
is contaminated.

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:36.036 align:middle line:84%
It is a poison and the only
reason it doesn't kill more

00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:39.139 align:middle line:84%
people out right is because
the dosing is very low

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:90%
in the water supply.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.242 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't make
it safe, it just means,

00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:44.978 align:middle line:84%
you're being killed
slowly with the poison.

00:15:44.978 --> 00:15:45.912 align:middle line:90%
And that's not a good thing.

00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:47.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I know.

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:48.515 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's a good
point that you bring up too

00:15:48.515 --> 00:15:51.918 align:middle line:84%
because if you run fluoridated
water through lead pipes

00:15:51.918 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
in all the older homes,
it's actually going

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:90%
to strip the pipes of lead

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.359 align:middle line:84%
and possibly other
contaminants that build up--

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Good point.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: --
within the pipes.

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.195 align:middle line:90%
So, you might-- you know,

00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:03.596 align:middle line:84%
you just don't know
what's your getting.

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:06.466 align:middle line:84%
I mean I-- you know, tap water--
you've done tests on tap water.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.334 align:middle line:84%
I've done lots of
tests on tap water.

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:11.871 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is one of the most
damaging and toxic things

00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:15.075 align:middle line:84%
that people can consume and
we're talking about water here.

00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:19.045 align:middle line:84%
And we're not even talking
about-- listen, all the beer,

00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:23.083 align:middle line:84%
the sodas, all the juices that
are made with tap water that are

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.552 align:middle line:84%
out there that people are
buying, who even knows,

00:16:25.552 --> 00:16:28.521 align:middle line:84%
there's no regulation or
no testing that, you know,

00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:30.623 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to go
get a Coke or something,

00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:33.793 align:middle line:84%
they have to disclose to
you or put on the label,

00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:36.062 align:middle line:84%
this contains this
amount of fluoride.

00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's a
really good point.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.567 align:middle line:84%
There's also fluoride in
the plants, in the produce

00:16:40.567 --> 00:16:41.801 align:middle line:84%
that you buy at the
grocery store.

00:16:41.801 --> 00:16:45.672 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because fluoridated
water is in many cases used

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:47.674 align:middle line:90%
to irrigate agriculture.

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.209 align:middle line:90%
And that's not regulated either.

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:52.278 align:middle line:84%
So, they can actually
have a toxic poison,

00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:54.981 align:middle line:84%
a toxic chemical
put on the plants

00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:58.384 align:middle line:84%
that is absorbed partially
through the roots obviously

00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:01.054 align:middle line:84%
and through the leaves
in some way--

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.388 align:middle line:90%
in some measure I should say.

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:04.157 align:middle line:84%
And then that becomes
part of the plant

00:17:04.157 --> 00:17:05.291 align:middle line:90%
and you're eating that.

00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:07.427 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned, Ed,
that psychiatric drug,

00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:09.729 align:middle line:84%
you said medications are
also based on fluoride,

00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:12.831 align:middle line:84%
it's absolutely true in
terms of molecular weight.

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:15.301 align:middle line:84%
SSIR drugs, the
antidepressants--

00:17:15.301 --> 00:17:16.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Prozac.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.706 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: -- psychiatric drugs
are about 14 percent fluorine,

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:22.375 align:middle line:84%
atomic fluorine by
molecular weight.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:26.111 align:middle line:84%
That's shocking because fluorine
does not belong anywhere

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:28.481 align:middle line:84%
in the human body and if
you get it into your brain,

00:17:28.481 --> 00:17:29.949 align:middle line:90%
it reacts the brain chemistry

00:17:29.949 --> 00:17:32.619 align:middle line:84%
which is why those drugs are
linked to so many suicides.

00:17:32.619 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.889 align:middle line:84%
Just like you said what
happens is we have a major

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.323 align:middle line:90%
iodine deficiency.

00:17:37.323 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And Mike brought it up earlier
Iodine is what helps your immune

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.396 align:middle line:84%
system, it controls
your metabolism,

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.565 align:middle line:84%
it regulates your
endocrine organs.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:49.836 align:middle line:84%
Breast cancer, fibrocystic
breast disease, ovarian cyst

00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:51.771 align:middle line:90%
on the ovaries, you know goiters

00:17:51.771 --> 00:17:56.576 align:middle line:84%
on the thyroid are just cystic
scar tissue, lack of iodine

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:59.145 align:middle line:84%
in the tyroid and the reason
why is because there's

00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:02.382 align:middle line:84%
so much fluoride,
there's so much chlorine,

00:18:02.382 --> 00:18:05.318 align:middle line:84%
there's so much bromine
and bromide that--

00:18:05.318 --> 00:18:09.289 align:middle line:84%
those halogens fight for
the receptor sites and clog

00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:13.326 align:middle line:84%
up the thyroid and don't
let iodine come in.

00:18:13.326 --> 00:18:16.129 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
these are all the symptoms

00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:17.263 align:middle line:90%
of iodine deficiency.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.299 align:middle line:84%
Once you start putting
more iodine in the body,

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:90%
it will kick out the fluoride.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.338 align:middle line:84%
It will kick out and
detoxified those toxic halogens,

00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:27.941 align:middle line:84%
and then you will start
to repair your body again

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.109 align:middle line:84%
and you won't have that
fibrocystic breast disease

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and a polycystic ovaries and
prostate cancer in men as well.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: So, yeah.

00:18:34.514 --> 00:18:35.882 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about solutions here

00:18:35.882 --> 00:18:38.551 align:middle line:84%
for the last segment
of the show here.

00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:39.786 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned iodine already.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.821 align:middle line:84%
That's really important
because iodine

00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:44.757 align:middle line:84%
when you have the proper
amount of iodine in your body,

00:18:44.757 --> 00:18:48.494 align:middle line:84%
it competes with
fluoride absorption.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:52.165 align:middle line:84%
So, the more iodine you
have, the less you're thyroid

00:18:52.165 --> 00:18:55.101 align:middle line:84%
in particular is
absorbing fluoride.

00:18:55.101 --> 00:18:58.471 align:middle line:84%
And thyroid of course
controls metabolism.

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:01.007 align:middle line:84%
Many people who suffer
from an unexplainable,

00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:04.043 align:middle line:84%
uncontrollable weight gain
are actually just suffering

00:19:04.043 --> 00:19:07.547 align:middle line:84%
from hypothyroidism and low
function of the thyroid gland

00:19:07.547 --> 00:19:10.683 align:middle line:84%
because it's been poisoned by
fluoride and not nutrified,

00:19:10.683 --> 00:19:13.119 align:middle line:84%
not nourished with
enough iodine.

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:15.121 align:middle line:84%
I know you're expert
on iodine, Ed, so.

00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:16.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I mean, iodine,

00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:19.425 align:middle line:84%
I would say is probably
the top mineral

00:19:19.425 --> 00:19:21.828 align:middle line:84%
that I would recommend
to everybody.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:24.797 align:middle line:84%
Just because we're so deficient
and we don't get enough iodine

00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:26.733 align:middle line:90%
in our food sources, Mike.

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:29.235 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I'm even nervous
about the whole Fukushima

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:32.005 align:middle line:84%
and I know we're doing a show
on radiation and the damage

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:34.507 align:middle line:84%
of radiation and we'll get
more into iodine on that show,

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:38.544 align:middle line:84%
but it is an element that
I feel everybody needs

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:41.214 align:middle line:84%
because of the toxic
amounts of chlorine

00:19:41.214 --> 00:19:43.116 align:middle line:90%
and fluoride and bromide.

00:19:43.116 --> 00:19:48.021 align:middle line:84%
You see they use to add iodine
to bread, white flour years ago.

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:50.556 align:middle line:84%
And they used to add
it to salt as well.

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:52.091 align:middle line:90%
But now, years ago,

00:19:52.091 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
they replaced the
iodine with bromide.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.464 align:middle line:84%
So now, you even have
more deficiency of iodine.

00:19:58.464 --> 00:20:02.001 align:middle line:84%
But in 2006-- Mike,
you know how I liked

00:20:02.001 --> 00:20:05.705 align:middle line:90%
to give people actual statistics

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:09.175 align:middle line:84%
because that's what it's all
about, real scientific studies.

00:20:09.175 --> 00:20:11.911 align:middle line:84%
In 2006, the Committee
of the National Academy

00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:18.351 align:middle line:84%
of Sciences published a 500 page
review of fluorides toxicity.

00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:19.686 align:middle line:90%
And the report concludes

00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:22.055 align:middle line:84%
that fluoride is an
endocrine disruptor

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:25.825 align:middle line:84%
and can affect the bones, the
brain, the thyroid glands,

00:20:25.825 --> 00:20:28.661 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland, and
even blood sugars.

00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:31.197 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about what happens
with the pineal gland.

00:20:31.197 --> 00:20:32.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, first
of all, back on that,

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:84%
you're saying it's an
endocrine disruptor

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.935 align:middle line:90%
that immediately got me thinking

00:20:35.935 --> 00:20:38.738 align:middle line:84%
about another contaminant
that's really common in foods

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.707 align:middle line:90%
and beverages which is cadmium.

00:20:40.707 --> 00:20:42.642 align:middle line:84%
And new research
on cadmium shows

00:20:42.642 --> 00:20:47.947 align:middle line:84%
that cadmium is also an
estrogen mimicker just like BPA.

00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:51.351 align:middle line:84%
So, the concept here that is
really important for all of you

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:54.287 align:middle line:84%
to grasp is that it's
not just the fluoride,

00:20:54.287 --> 00:20:57.924 align:middle line:84%
it's not just the cadmium which
refining in organic brown rice

00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:00.860 align:middle line:84%
by the way, many varieties
of rice contained cadmium.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.663 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
BPA, the Bisphenol A,

00:21:03.663 --> 00:21:06.866 align:middle line:84%
it's this combination
of all these chemicals.

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:84%
How they multiplied the
toxic effects of each other

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.206 align:middle line:90%
and create a chemical cocktail

00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:15.441 align:middle line:84%
that is extremely toxic
to the human body.

00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:18.745 align:middle line:84%
I think this explains many of
the hormone sensitive cancers

00:21:18.745 --> 00:21:21.614 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing today,
breast cancer, prostate cancer.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:25.518 align:middle line:84%
They're also explaining even
some of the crazy behavior

00:21:25.518 --> 00:21:26.719 align:middle line:90%
that we're seeing in people--

00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:29.022 align:middle line:84%
you know, a lot of people
are crazier these days.

00:21:29.022 --> 00:21:32.759 align:middle line:84%
Their mode are swinging wildly
because of the malnourishment,

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:36.329 align:middle line:84%
lack of nutrition combined
with this toxic chemicals

00:21:36.329 --> 00:21:37.897 align:middle line:84%
that we're discussing
including fluoride.

00:21:37.897 --> 00:21:39.732 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And the
skeletal fluorosis.

00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:41.067 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like
dental fluorosis

00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:42.435 align:middle line:90%
but skeletal fluorosis.

00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:44.837 align:middle line:84%
You wonder why so many
people have hip fractures

00:21:44.837 --> 00:21:46.939 align:middle line:90%
over 60, 50, 60 years old?

00:21:46.939 --> 00:21:48.241 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yup.

00:21:48.241 --> 00:21:50.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Fluoride will
turn your bones so brittle

00:21:50.276 --> 00:21:56.082 align:middle line:84%
that you'll be susceptible
to fractures throughout life.

00:21:56.082 --> 00:22:01.187 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland is an area
in your brain that if you look

00:22:01.187 --> 00:22:03.689 align:middle line:84%
at in the Indian Mythology
and spirituality, I mean,

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:06.392 align:middle line:84%
most religions will say
that's your third eye.

00:22:06.392 --> 00:22:10.897 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's strange that fluoride
accumulates very rapidly

00:22:10.897 --> 00:22:12.265 align:middle line:90%
in the pineal gland--

00:22:12.265 --> 00:22:13.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Right, and
shuts it down.

00:22:13.366 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: -- shuts it down.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.038 align:middle line:84%
And that's really your spiritual
opening of the third eye.

00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:19.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:22:19.739 --> 00:22:20.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: You know,

00:22:20.807 --> 00:22:23.443 align:middle line:84%
that's how we have
increased consciousness.

00:22:23.443 --> 00:22:27.814 align:middle line:84%
But if you shut that pineal
gland down at an early age,

00:22:27.814 --> 00:22:31.384 align:middle line:84%
I mean, kids are already born
with high spiritual, you know,

00:22:31.384 --> 00:22:34.987 align:middle line:84%
abilities, but if you
immediately start putting this

00:22:34.987 --> 00:22:37.223 align:middle line:84%
water and people mix
this with their--

00:22:37.223 --> 00:22:38.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:22:38.491 --> 00:22:40.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- baby formulas
which contain all kinds

00:22:40.326 --> 00:22:44.263 align:middle line:84%
of other stuff like GMOs and
stuff that are neurotoxic

00:22:44.263 --> 00:22:48.734 align:middle line:84%
to the body, then you can
shut down that kid's ability

00:22:48.734 --> 00:22:52.405 align:middle line:84%
to thrive with a high
IQ in that pineal gland

00:22:52.405 --> 00:22:55.007 align:middle line:84%
that kid will not
grow spiritually.

00:22:55.007 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, I think
there's a whole agenda here

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.512 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps this is a
whole different show

00:22:59.512 --> 00:23:03.249 align:middle line:84%
about disconnecting people
from their spiritual selves.

00:23:03.249 --> 00:23:05.852 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the energy
centers of the body, you know,

00:23:05.852 --> 00:23:09.322 align:middle line:84%
often called the
chakras, these correlate

00:23:09.322 --> 00:23:11.958 align:middle line:84%
to the glands, the
endocrine glands.

00:23:11.958 --> 00:23:15.161 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what
gets shut down by fluoride.

00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:19.332 align:middle line:84%
So, if you were, let's say
running the world and you wanted

00:23:19.332 --> 00:23:22.802 align:middle line:84%
to keep people disconnected
from their higher selves

00:23:22.802 --> 00:23:25.838 align:middle line:84%
or from connection with
spirit, a very clever way to do

00:23:25.838 --> 00:23:28.875 align:middle line:84%
that would be to put something
in the water supply that shuts

00:23:28.875 --> 00:23:32.411 align:middle line:84%
down the pineal gland and that's
exactly what is happening right

00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:33.579 align:middle line:90%
now with sodium fluoride.

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:34.714 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You
know, and another thing

00:23:34.714 --> 00:23:37.083 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't mention
besides the toothpaste

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:38.684 align:middle line:90%
and the water is tea.

00:23:38.684 --> 00:23:40.586 align:middle line:84%
How many people do you
know that drink tea?

00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:43.256 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I go to a restaurant
which I don't really do

00:23:43.256 --> 00:23:45.458 align:middle line:84%
that often, but if I look
around at the tables,

00:23:45.458 --> 00:23:48.394 align:middle line:84%
I see this big glasses
of ice tea everywhere.

00:23:48.394 --> 00:23:50.963 align:middle line:84%
Number one, they are made
most likely with tap water

00:23:50.963 --> 00:23:52.798 align:middle line:84%
so they have a bunch
of fluoride in them.

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:53.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:55.234 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And
number two, black tea

00:23:55.234 --> 00:23:57.737 align:middle line:84%
and regular tea has
been shown now

00:23:57.737 --> 00:23:59.872 align:middle line:84%
to contain high levels
of fluoride.

00:23:59.872 --> 00:24:01.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And that's because
of the plant, the tea plant,

00:24:01.574 --> 00:24:05.444 align:middle line:84%
naturally takes up a tremendous
amount of fluoride, naturally.

00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
It brings it in, but
it concentrates it

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.117 align:middle line:84%
which then once you
stiff that in hot water,

00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that creates fluoride that
can again be an overdose.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.655 align:middle line:84%
But, I know we're
talking about solutions.

00:24:15.655 --> 00:24:16.956 align:middle line:90%
We only have a few minutes left.

00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:19.792 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
avoidance strategies, Ed.

00:24:19.792 --> 00:24:20.593 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:24:20.593 --> 00:24:21.761 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: This is number one.

00:24:21.761 --> 00:24:23.529 align:middle line:84%
If you can avoid the
fluoride then you're going

00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:24.764 align:middle line:90%
to be much better off.

00:24:24.764 --> 00:24:28.935 align:middle line:84%
So, give us a rundown of
ways to just avoid fluoride.

00:24:28.935 --> 00:24:30.102 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well,
the number way

00:24:30.102 --> 00:24:33.606 align:middle line:84%
to avoid fluoride is
not drink tap water.

00:24:33.606 --> 00:24:36.042 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would say that's
the number one thing.

00:24:36.042 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Switch to an organic
non-fluoridated toothpaste.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.317 align:middle line:84%
Brush your teeth with
baking soda for example

00:24:44.317 --> 00:24:46.919 align:middle line:90%
or some natural essential oil

00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:50.389 align:middle line:84%
or some natural compound,
but avoid toothpaste.

00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:53.025 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you're on
prescription medications,

00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:54.827 align:middle line:84%
if you're on antidepressants,
you know,

00:24:54.827 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:84%
there's natural alternative like
lithium orotate or, you know,

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.133 align:middle line:84%
by cleansing your body
and reducing the amount

00:25:01.133 --> 00:25:02.335 align:middle line:90%
of toxic build up, a lot

00:25:02.335 --> 00:25:05.938 align:middle line:84%
of times your mental
stability comes back.

00:25:05.938 --> 00:25:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Most people think that they're
just depressed all of a sudden,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.810 align:middle line:84%
but usually it's because of
these toxins that are coming

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.813 align:middle line:84%
into their body that are
causing them to be depressed.

00:25:13.813 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.382 align:middle line:84%
And those prescription
medications,

00:25:16.382 --> 00:25:20.052 align:middle line:84%
they may have a short term
effect, but it's no better

00:25:20.052 --> 00:25:22.288 align:middle line:84%
than placebo according to
the scientific studies.

00:25:22.288 --> 00:25:24.857 align:middle line:84%
If you just think you're going
to feel better, you're going

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:28.194 align:middle line:84%
to feel just as good as taking
an antidepressant, but then even

00:25:28.194 --> 00:25:30.896 align:middle line:84%
in the long term, you have
this additional burden

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:32.665 align:middle line:90%
of more fluorine atoms going

00:25:32.665 --> 00:25:35.801 align:middle line:84%
into your brain interfering
with brain chemistry.

00:25:35.801 --> 00:25:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And then when you come
off of those drugs,

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.939 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people feel suicidal.

00:25:39.939 --> 00:25:42.675 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
history of the school shootings

00:25:42.675 --> 00:25:43.342 align:middle line:90%
that have happened in the--

00:25:43.342 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: -- United
States, almost everyone

00:25:45.778 --> 00:25:48.381 align:middle line:84%
of those shootings has been
linked to either a kid that's

00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:51.250 align:middle line:84%
on antidepressants or a kid
that just recently came off

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.286 align:middle line:84%
of antidepressants and
went crazy, went suicidal

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:55.421 align:middle line:84%
and killed a bunch
of other kids.

00:25:55.421 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So, it's actually quite
a history of death

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.525 align:middle line:84%
and destruction not
just Nazi Germany,

00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:01.961 align:middle line:84%
but also modern day
school shootings are tied

00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
to the same chemical
which is sodium fluoride.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:05.631 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:26:05.631 --> 00:26:09.402 align:middle line:84%
So avoiding as many
ingredients that you can

00:26:09.402 --> 00:26:13.406 align:middle line:84%
that contains fluoride and
next detoxing, cleansing--

00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yes.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- your body
on a regular basis, and Mike,

00:26:15.875 --> 00:26:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the best
and the fastest way

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.780 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate fluoride
is with iodine.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:25.017 align:middle line:84%
And I only recommend a nascent
detoxified form of iodine

00:26:25.017 --> 00:26:28.854 align:middle line:84%
and even up to 5-10
milligrams a day.

00:26:28.854 --> 00:26:31.957 align:middle line:84%
I think that people are so
deficient at this vital nutrient

00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:34.493 align:middle line:84%
that everybody needs
to be taking this,

00:26:34.493 --> 00:26:37.897 align:middle line:84%
especially with all the risks
and all the contaminants

00:26:37.897 --> 00:26:39.131 align:middle line:84%
that are coming in
into the body.

00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:42.001 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You just mentioned
5-10 milligrams a day--

00:26:42.001 --> 00:26:42.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:43.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: -- and I
want to be sure

00:26:43.936 --> 00:26:45.571 align:middle line:84%
that that people
understand what that is

00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:49.542 align:middle line:84%
because the US government only
recommends I believe micrograms.

00:26:49.542 --> 00:26:52.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yes,
like 150 micrograms.

00:26:52.011 --> 00:26:52.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:26:52.511 --> 00:26:53.145 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:53.145 --> 00:26:54.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:26:54.547 --> 00:26:57.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So you're talking about
orders of magnitude more iodine

00:26:57.249 --> 00:27:00.853 align:middle line:84%
which actually doctors like
Dr. David Brownstein agrees

00:27:00.853 --> 00:27:02.154 align:middle line:90%
with that assessment.

00:27:02.154 --> 00:27:05.691 align:middle line:84%
Japanese populations intake
those very high levels,

00:27:05.691 --> 00:27:08.094 align:middle line:84%
I think one study show that
Japanese women can take

00:27:08.094 --> 00:27:11.597 align:middle line:84%
in as much as 10,
12, and 14 milligrams

00:27:11.597 --> 00:27:13.999 align:middle line:84%
of iodine a day eating
a lot of seafood.

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:15.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:27:15.134 --> 00:27:16.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Again, that's
a thousand times more

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:17.837 align:middle line:84%
than micrograms just
so you know.

00:27:17.837 --> 00:27:19.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:21.841 align:middle line:84%
That would be 5,000
micrograms or 10,000 micrograms.

00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:22.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:23.709 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:27:23.709 --> 00:27:25.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And even in the
state of nuclear holocaust,

00:27:25.845 --> 00:27:28.748 align:middle line:84%
you could even go up to
200 milligrams initially

00:27:28.748 --> 00:27:29.849 align:middle line:90%
for iodine--

00:27:29.849 --> 00:27:30.816 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Maybe for a
short period of time.

00:27:30.816 --> 00:27:31.517 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: For a short--

00:27:31.517 --> 00:27:32.618 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:32.618 --> 00:27:33.853 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: For a
short period of time.

00:27:33.853 --> 00:27:34.820 align:middle line:84%
But I tell you what, iodine
is one of the best ways

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.055 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate fluoride
in the body.

00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:38.357 align:middle line:90%
The next thing is zeolite.

00:27:38.357 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, I recommend
that you do your research,

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.462 align:middle line:84%
find a good zeolite that
could be taken internally.

00:27:43.462 --> 00:27:47.066 align:middle line:84%
That was actually used
in Germany and Russia

00:27:47.066 --> 00:27:52.171 align:middle line:84%
and many other countries
to help detoxify fluoride.

00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:53.806 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
most people don't know

00:27:53.806 --> 00:27:56.142 align:middle line:84%
about is tamarind,
the fruit tamarind.

00:27:56.142 --> 00:28:01.247 align:middle line:84%
Tamarind has been shown to help
detoxify fluoride from the body

00:28:01.247 --> 00:28:03.149 align:middle line:90%
as well what-- as well

00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:07.820 align:middle line:84%
as cilantro actually
mobilizes fluoride cilantro.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.889 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Cilantro has been
studied right now as a plant--

00:28:09.889 --> 00:28:14.026 align:middle line:84%
a natural remediation for water
that's contaminated with led,

00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:15.594 align:middle line:90%
cadmium, arsenic and mercury.

00:28:15.594 --> 00:28:18.597 align:middle line:84%
So, cilantro does pull
metals out of water.

00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:21.300 align:middle line:84%
That's well supported in
the scientific literature.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.537 align:middle line:84%
So Zeolites are pretty
amazing all by themselves.

00:28:24.537 --> 00:28:27.373 align:middle line:84%
You also mentioned nascent
iodine and I want to make sure

00:28:27.373 --> 00:28:29.742 align:middle line:84%
that the viewers understand
what that really is.

00:28:29.742 --> 00:28:33.379 align:middle line:84%
It's really an elemental atomic
iodine that is electrified.

00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:37.283 align:middle line:84%
So, it's actually-- there's
electric current that is put

00:28:37.283 --> 00:28:40.719 align:middle line:84%
through it to energized
the solution

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:47.326 align:middle line:84%
at an atomic level allowing
the iodine molecules or atoms

00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:50.696 align:middle line:84%
to be isolated so that
they're ready to bond

00:28:50.696 --> 00:28:52.164 align:middle line:90%
with other elements in your body

00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:53.933 align:middle line:84%
and release energy
in that bonding.

00:28:53.933 --> 00:28:55.267 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely.

00:28:55.267 --> 00:28:58.571 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. You know, we're not saying
go to your local drugstore

00:28:58.571 --> 00:29:00.506 align:middle line:84%
and purchase the iodine
over the counter because--

00:29:00.506 --> 00:29:01.774 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: No.

00:29:01.774 --> 00:29:03.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- that's
toxic and it's dangerous.

00:29:03.142 --> 00:29:06.212 align:middle line:84%
And even potassium iodide,
you know, that's something

00:29:06.212 --> 00:29:09.081 align:middle line:84%
that you would-- if you
have the ability to get

00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:11.050 align:middle line:84%
on the atomic iodine, that's
always going to be the best.

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:11.617 align:middle line:90%
Although--

00:29:11.617 --> 00:29:12.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right.

00:29:12.718 --> 00:29:13.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: -- the
potassium could be used

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:14.787 align:middle line:90%
in an emergency situation.

00:29:14.787 --> 00:29:17.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And povidone iodine
is toxic to ingest right?

00:29:17.823 --> 00:29:21.694 align:middle line:84%
That's a powerful antibiotic
use topically by surgeons and,

00:29:21.694 --> 00:29:23.128 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you've
got cuts or scrapes.

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:27.199 align:middle line:84%
So don't go drinking povidone
iodine or any other source

00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:30.336 align:middle line:84%
of elemental iodine unless
it's specifically offered

00:29:30.336 --> 00:29:31.871 align:middle line:90%
as a dietary supplement.

00:29:31.871 --> 00:29:33.806 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So, we know you
guys have learned a lot today

00:29:33.806 --> 00:29:35.307 align:middle line:90%
about fluoride.

00:29:35.307 --> 00:29:37.543 align:middle line:84%
We hope that you continue

feed your baby this water

00:29:50.222 --> 00:29:53.125 align:middle line:84%
which contains sodium fluoride,
but thanks for watching.
