&gt;&gt; Mike Adams: Welcome
to Secrets

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.198 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
to Health with Mike and Ed.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:33.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I'm Mike Adams, the
Editor of Naturalnews.com.

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:34.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Edward Group:
And I'm Ed Group,

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the Owner of
Globalhealingcenter.com.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And today, the episode
is called Home Health Makeover,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.243 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
and what we've assembled for you
is a huge collection of products

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
to avoid toxic products and
then products to replace them

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.750 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
with that are far
better for your health.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.617 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:8%
Ed.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.019 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Absolutely, Mike.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.955 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
I mean most homes are extremely
toxic and we've done episodes

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:57.257 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
on that before, but we get
the question all the time,

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.392 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
what do we do about it?

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.794 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
How do we recognize
these toxic compounds?

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:05.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So today, Mike and I took many
of the common household items

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that every house has and we're
going to go through them one

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
by one and kind of explain
to you why they're toxic,

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.173 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
maybe read off some
of the ingredients

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
so you can understand
those, but most importantly,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
we're going to give
you natural solutions.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.847 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yes.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:22.249 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And
natural replacements,

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.118 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
because it's really a replace
this with that type scenario.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.486 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
That's what you need to do.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:30.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The next time you go and
purchase these cleaners,

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.993 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
laundry detergents,
skincare products;

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:36.196 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
anything that you're going
to be putting on your body,

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:41.301 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
around your body, in your home,
to make that informed decision

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
so you can buy something
that's actually healthy

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
or non-toxic instead

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.207 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
of something that's going
to cause you damage.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Mike: And the good news, Ed,

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:51.111 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
is that there healthy
alternatives for everything

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.514 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
out there and by the way, let's
start with laundry detergent

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:57.617 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
because I've been breathing the
fumes [laughter] of this box

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.921 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
of Tide, which is why I have
it in a bag, but it's so strong

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with these solvents and
perfumes, it's actually coming

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.493 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
through the bag and
I'm getting fumigated

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.995 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
by this just standing here.

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:09.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So let me show you this first.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This is a -- probably the most
famous conventional laundry

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:16.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
detergent, Tide.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.372 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
Everybody knows about Tide.

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:21.108 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
Now, it's full of
perfumes and so I'm going

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:22.409 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
to get it out of the way.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.645 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
In fact, bye, and show you
something that's far safer.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.713 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Well
first of all, Mike,

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:28.548 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
it's more than just perfumes.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:29.182 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:18%
It's...

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:30.317 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh yeah.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:31.685 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...actual
chemicals and oxidants,

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:34.121 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and the sad thing about it
is, they're not required

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:35.922 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
to list these chemicals
on the label.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.024 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right.

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:38.258 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: So we
really don't even know.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.894 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
It could be 50, 60, 100,
200 in different chemicals.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:41.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:42.929 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Think about it.

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.831 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
If you have oil on your
clothes, if you have dirt

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.567 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
on your clothes, if you spill
coffee on your clothes, I mean,

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
think of all the
different things

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:51.505 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that people get on
their clothes...

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:52.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, yeah.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:53.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...not
to mention you know,

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:56.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
their clothes are exposed to the
air quality, the fossil fuels.

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:57.811 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
They're walking around all day.

00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:01.281 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
You have to have some
serious chemical cleaners

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:05.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in those laundry detergents
in order to get clothes clean.

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:07.487 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Mike: But you know, what's
really in that detergent,

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:08.655 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
it's frightening to me.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
It's so powerful.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.759 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I have a personal story for
you about that, but you are,

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.963 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in effect, bathing your
clothes in those chemicals

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and they stay in the clothing.

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:21.201 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
They don't -- a rinse cycle
doesn't get it all out.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Not only are you then flushing
those chemicals down the drain

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:26.506 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
and downstream and into
the water supply which goes

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.341 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
into the rivers and the oceans,

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but you're also then putting
those clothes on your body.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.181 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
And then if you are walking
-- or maybe it's a hot day,

00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:37.851 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
or you're working out at a
gym, you are then absorbing --

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:39.119 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
you're making the clothes wet

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:41.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and you're absorbing those
chemicals into your skin.

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:43.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And just to let you know
how these powerful these are

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
at being absorbed, I had
a family member one time

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.698 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that drove to Texas to visit
me, and he brought in a couple

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:55.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of gallon jugs of water that he
had on the road for us to drink.

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So he opened it up
and poured it out.

00:03:57.871 --> 00:03:59.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We started drinking the water.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.908 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
I took one sip, and
I said, "Holy cow,

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
that tastes like
laundry detergent."

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And he said, "How can it
taste like laundry detergent?"

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:12.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Turned out in his RV, he had put
the gallons of water next to...

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.019 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Oh.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.187 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: ...Tide.

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.022 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
They were just physically
next to each other.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
The Tide detergent had gone
into, just through osmosis

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
through the plastic,
through the air.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.631 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
It had gone into the water
and it made the water taste

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:25.966 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
like laundry detergent.

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:30.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That's how potent these solvents
or fragrances really are.

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:31.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
It's unbelievable.

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:33.073 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: It's
something so simple

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:34.774 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that you would never
think about.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.444 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
I mean, people wash
their clothes.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.846 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
They dry their clothes
and then all of a sudden,

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:42.048 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
they have all these
chemicals in their clothes.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:44.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They sweat, and all that
stuff goes through the skin.

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.786 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
The skin is the largest
organ in the body.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.422 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
So if I was to say
hey, "How do you feel

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:51.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
about rubbing all these
chemicals on the largest organ

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.593 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
in your body, would
you do that?"

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:54.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: [Laughter].

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:56.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Somebody would
hopefully they would say no,

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.064 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
but that's what's happening
and not only that...

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:59.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.467 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...with the dry
cleaning, I know we talked

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:01.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
about that in one of
the other episodes,

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:03.937 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
but the dry cleaning is
also toxic chemicals.

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:06.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And people dress
their babies in these clothes.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They wash their baby
clothes in these chemicals

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.311 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
and put it on their babies.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.114 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
You know, when I walk through
a neighborhood, you know here

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:17.551 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
in Texas, they have these big
neighborhoods like KB Home type

00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
of neighborhoods in Houston
and other major cities.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If I walk through a
neighborhood, what do you smell?

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:26.993 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
You smell laundry detergent
and dryer sheets being vented

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:31.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
out of every other home down
the road -- down the street,

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
you know, just walking
on the sidewalk.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:37.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
For me, that experience
is I know that I'm walking

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:38.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
through a neighborhood of people

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.507 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
who are poisoning
their children.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.175 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
That's not an exaggeration.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I can smell it and I can't
be near it because I don't --

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:46.346 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
obviously, I don't want
to inhale that poison.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.948 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
So let's get to the solution.

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:49.449 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Well the sad
thing you mentioned too is

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
the environment.

00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:51.384 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They're putting that
stuff back into the air...

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yes, yes.

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...and they're
breathing it, so even though...

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.624 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...you use natural
stuff, you have to breathe just

00:05:57.624 --> 00:05:59.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
like tobacco smoke, and fossil
fuel, and everything else

00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:01.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that you're not actually
doing it,

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:03.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
but you have to breathe it in.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.231 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right.

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:05.532 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
And it was funny is a
lot of these people,

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.468 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
they're really delusional
because they may give money

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:10.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to breast cancer research.

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:11.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
They may do recycling.

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:14.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They might drive a Prius and
they think they're living green,

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and then they're soaking
their clothing in toxic,

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
cancer causing chemicals
and putting it on their kids

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
and venting that stuff into
their local neighborhood.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.187 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
It's they're delusional, you
know, so don't be delusional.

00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:29.189 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Understand that you
need to get the toxins

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:30.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
out of your life everywhere.

00:06:30.924 --> 00:06:33.827 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
You can't be incongruent in your
behavior, thinking you're green

00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:36.029 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
on one hand while
you're poisoning yourself

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and your children
on the other hand.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:39.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yes.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.267 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Mike: So the solution.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:42.235 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
There are several
different brands.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.704 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
Ecos is a brand that I use.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:48.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This is my favorite laundry
detergent, just happens to be.

00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:51.544 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I don't have any special
affiliation with this brand,

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:55.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but we've got Seventh Generation
back here, another great brand.

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:58.852 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
They're -- and if you want to
get something quote natural

00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:02.289 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
at the grocery store, you
can also get baking soda,

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
which can be mixed with Borax,

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and that's a great
natural detergent.

00:07:07.227 --> 00:07:09.863 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
You can also use soap nuts.

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:13.633 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
This is a soap nut
concentrate product right here.

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
There are many different
soap nut products.

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:19.472 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
It's made from the soap nut
berry, which grows on trees

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:23.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and they extract the
saponins -- or saponins.

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:25.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I've heard it pronounced
both ways.

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:28.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
But it's -- that's the
soap in the soap berry

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:29.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that can clean your laundry.

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:31.518 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
So those are some
of the solutions.

00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:32.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I love
the soap berries.

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:35.622 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
That's what I use, and I
mean it's incredible the way

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
that it cleans, and
it's non-toxic.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.526 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
And then you know, the other
factor too is most people are

00:07:39.526 --> 00:07:42.962 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
using the public water with
the fluoride and the chlorine

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
to wash their clothes.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, that's right.

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:46.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: That's a whole
other story, right there.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:47.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: [Laughter].

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:48.835 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: But you know,
I also use the soap nuts

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:51.104 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
as a dishwashing
detergent, as well.

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:52.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And that works
great on the dishes, so.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.542 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, and
finally, I've also --

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:56.943 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
I noticed we've got
some Dr. Bronner's.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:08:00.647 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
If you have had one
product in your household

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:04.617 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
that is the multi-purpose
cleaner for laundry,

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:06.686 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
for kitchen counters,
for bathrooms,

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for everything, Dr. Bronner's.

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I mean, you can wash
your hair...

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.258 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You can, you can.

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:14.327 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Mike: ...you can wash your
laundry with Dr. Bronner's.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:17.197 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
This is -- I can't live
without Dr. Bronner's soap.

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:19.132 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
I mean, you got to have this,
and this is super clean.

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
It's a fair trade.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.036 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
It's got no crazy artificial
chemicals or fragrance in it,

00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:24.838 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
and the company just rocks.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:28.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I mean Dr. Bronner's and
David Bronner, a huge activist

00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:32.345 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
for GMO labeling and they
helped get hemp seeds legalized

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.248 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
in America so that we can
now have hemp seed products

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
and super foods.

00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:38.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The company's great,
product's fantastic.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:39.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: It is.

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.354 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
It's one of those all-purpose
cleansers that you can use

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:44.424 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
for everything; talking
about soap and hand soap.

00:08:44.424 --> 00:08:48.128 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
I picked this up, and this
is a very common hand soap.

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:49.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; Mike: What is
-- what is that?

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.497 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: This
is Dial Gold...

00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:51.631 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, great.

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:52.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...hand
soap with moisturizer,

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and even says doctor
recommended.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Number one doctor recommended.

00:08:56.603 --> 00:08:57.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I don't know where these
doctors are coming from.

00:08:57.971 --> 00:08:58.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Are those
the same doctors

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:00.273 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
that recommended
you smoke Camels.

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:02.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Well these
are the same doctors too

00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:04.878 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
that absolutely have no
idea about chemicals,

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and want you coming
back into their office

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:09.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
so they can prescribe you more
medications and skin creams

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:11.217 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
for all the reactions
this is going to cause.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.152 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Crazy.

00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:12.852 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: But
listen to this.

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:14.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Sodium laurel sulfate.

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:17.223 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
I mean, you got, you know
you have to be a chemist

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.525 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
to pronounce some
of these things.

00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:19.793 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: That's true, yeah.

00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:20.927 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You know, I
can't even pronounce them

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:22.028 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and I actually have a
background in chemistry.

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:23.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: [Laughter].

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:23.997 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Vetane,
sodium chloride,

00:09:23.997 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
which is salt, PPG, hydroxo.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.205 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I mean, DMCM, tetrasodium,
citric acid, yellow number five,

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:35.442 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
red number four, which
are extremely toxic dyes.

00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:36.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:38.578 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I mean think
about the society that we live

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:42.215 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
in right now and how many times
people wash their hands every

00:09:42.215 --> 00:09:44.284 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
single day when they
go to the bathroom.

00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:45.552 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
I mean, it's basically --

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:48.455 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
I know mothers that make
their kids wash their hands

00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:51.724 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
like non-stop, sometimes
like 50 to 100 times a day.

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.026 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Which is
not a bad practice...

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Mike: ...but you're talking

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:55.862 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
about they're putting
this crazy soap

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:58.565 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
on their skin 50
times a day and maybe

00:09:58.565 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with the antibacterial
chemicals too.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, and
it's not just hand soap,

00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:03.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
but all the soaps like this.

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.505 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I mean the
shampoos that we're going

00:10:05.505 --> 00:10:09.909 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to talk about, the bar
soaps, the body lotion soaps

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
that people are using.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:16.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And again, Mike,
think of how many tiny cells

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:19.452 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
that you have covering
your whole body, your skin.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I mean think of the
surface area of your skin,

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:23.756 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
and when you put this on,

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:26.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
how many chemicals you
absorb on a daily basis.

00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:28.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Mike: You know that's
a really good point

00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:32.165 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
because the position of the FDA
is that chemicals don't have

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:35.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to be listed by these companies,
because the FDA assumes

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that they don't go
through your skin;

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:39.472 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
that absorption doesn't happen.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
This is the FDA's
official position.

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:44.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But it's false you know,
scientifically invalid.

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
It's logically twisted.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.782 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
Of course things get
absorbed through your skin.

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:51.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You know, your skin
absorbs all kinds of things.

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
It's porous.

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:57.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So these companies are getting
away with, in my opinion,

00:10:57.423 --> 00:11:00.226 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
you know, poisoning people by
not listing the ingredients

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:03.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
or using ingredients that
have never been safety tested,

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:06.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
never been approved by
the FDA for use on humans.

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:07.166 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
And I want to mention this too.

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Notice the color
of this Dial soap.

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:11.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It's an amber type of color.

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:13.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: A golden
kind of a color.

00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:14.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Notice the
color of this Listerine.

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:17.744 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This is their blue and then
they've got their yellow version

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:19.479 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
of Listerine.

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:22.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Every product that is made

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:25.385 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
by the chemical companies
is artificially colored.

00:11:25.385 --> 00:11:27.787 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You'll notice that
consumers have been taught

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:31.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
or indoctrinated to believe that
certain colors are associated

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:32.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
with certain products.

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:35.161 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
So what color is
a window cleaner?

00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:36.195 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Well,
you look outside,

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.931 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the sky is blue so
it must be blue.

00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:38.965 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Got to be blue, right?

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:40.466 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
So but the blue is synthetic.

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:41.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Its blue dyes.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
There's no reason why window
cleaner has to be blue.

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:45.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So that's why if you look at
natural products like this,

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:47.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
this is a natural floor cleaner.

00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:49.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
It's actually clear.

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The chemistry of cleaning
doesn't need coloring to work.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.749 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
In fact, this product works
better than any you know,

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:59.118 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
synthetic floor cleaner
that you could imagine,

00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
but it doesn't have
to have color in it.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.292 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So consumers are indoctrinated
with these fake color messages

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:09.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that they are trained to
use in purchasing decisions.

00:12:09.996 --> 00:12:11.731 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yes,
and I totally agree.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.933 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
I mean, this actually
looks clean to me.

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:14.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:15.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I like
this clear...

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:16.336 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Exactly.

00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:17.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...clean look.

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:17.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Whoa, here we go.

00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:19.138 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
And cleaning the table.

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:20.807 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And you know,
I would much rather use this

00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:24.177 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
than this right here because
if -- this is a creamy,

00:12:24.177 --> 00:12:25.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
nasty looking color...

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:26.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:27.614 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...and
I tell you what...

00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:28.748 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, don't
want to deal with that.

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:29.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...there
are so many chemicals

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:31.718 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
in these floor cleaning
products.

00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:33.019 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
Carpet cleaning products...

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:34.354 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, man.

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:34.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...you know,
powders that you put all over...

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:35.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...your carpet.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.125 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This right here is for
floors, shines and protects.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.928 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
What it doesn't say though is
it outgasses toxic chemicals

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.129 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
and for how long it's on there.

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
And you know what?

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I can't even find an
ingredient list on here.

00:12:46.566 --> 00:12:49.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Of course it says it's poison,
keep out of reach of children,

00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:53.239 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and there's a number to call on
there, Poison Control Center.

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:53.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Well, that's the thing.

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:55.274 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: So.

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:56.542 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Mike: If its poison and you
got to keep it out of the reach

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.277 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of children, why would you
clean your floors with it?

00:12:58.277 --> 00:12:59.946 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
If you have kids, you
know, they're going to come

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:02.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
into contact with the
floor obviously, and pets.

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:04.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I mean, you're kids are going to
pet your pets and they're going

00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:06.886 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
to absorb or be exposed
to those chemicals

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:08.488 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
that are in these products.

00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:10.957 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
So you got to change your
mindset, and I know most

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.726 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
of you watching this
because you're Gaiam members.

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:15.028 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
You already get this.

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:17.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But what we're hoping to
do is give you more ideas.

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:18.798 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
There might be some
areas of your home

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:22.068 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
where you are you know, doing
the right things; your laundry,

00:13:22.068 --> 00:13:25.505 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
your cooking pans and so on,
but there might be other areas

00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:26.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
where you could make
improvements.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.241 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
So let's keep going
on the list here.

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:30.143 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Let's keep going.

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Let me move
these floor cleaners

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
out of the way here.

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:32.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:33.713 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This one actually smells good,
by the way.

00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:35.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And we were
talking about just one thing

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:37.016 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that we have here Mike and I
picked up, and this kind of goes

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:40.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in the soap and the
body lotion things is,

00:13:40.353 --> 00:13:43.723 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
how many people do you
know that have dry skin?

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:48.094 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
How many people do you know that
always lather, and mostly women,

00:13:48.094 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I say you know, because that's
the ones that I talk to most

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.067 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
of the time, that
lather these creams

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:57.336 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and these body lotions all over
their body every single day.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.171 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Wow.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And you know what?

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:01.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They usually do it when they
come out of a hot shower

00:14:01.574 --> 00:14:04.177 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and what happens is when
you heat the body...

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:06.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...all
the skin pores open

00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:09.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
up so what you're doing is
just loading these chemicals

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:23%
right in.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And here we have glycerin,
stearic acid, glycol stearate,

00:14:14.487 --> 00:14:16.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
a lot of petroleum base.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:19.692 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
I mean it's just like rubbing
oil on your skin that goes

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
into the car actually.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.296 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
Isopropyl pometate.

00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:25.398 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
There's nobody that can
tell you what happens

00:14:25.398 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
when you put all these
chemicals together.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.535 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
There's chain reactions
that happen.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:33.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There's reactions between these
chemicals that go into your skin

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:36.476 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
and like we talk about,
you know we're here

00:14:36.476 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
to give you solutions.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.813 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What really amazed me though
is when I started looking

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
at baby care products...

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:43.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, yeah.

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:46.652 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...and this is a
Johnson &amp; Johnson baby lotion.

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:49.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
And in this lotion

00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:52.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
you have over
30 carcinogenic chemicals.

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:55.495 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Each one of them in here
is a cancer causing agent.

00:14:55.495 --> 00:14:58.097 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: There is --
the name baby lotion is

00:14:58.097 --> 00:14:59.732 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
completely contrived.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:02.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
There's nothing characteristic
in the product

00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:04.804 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
that would qualify it
to be used on a baby,

00:15:04.804 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and there's no FDA requirement
that something labeled

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
for babies is determined
to be safe on babies.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.245 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
So watch out.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:15.214 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Also, children's food, kids'
food in the grocery stores,

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:18.151 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
some of the most toxic
food you could imagine.

00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:21.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So in personal care products
as well as food and groceries,

00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:24.657 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
watch out for baby products
or kids' or children's products

00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:26.325 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
because those are
often the worst.

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:29.162 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And you know what,
baby skin is even more sensitive

00:15:29.162 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
and if you rub this
on a baby's skin,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.533 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
it's going to cause
an immune reaction,

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:36.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which babies' immune
systems are just developing,

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:40.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and they can't handle a lot
of toxins coming in, bacteria,

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:43.109 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
any type of chemical coming in.

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.777 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
The thing is people
need to learn how

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to read the labels
a little bit more...

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:48.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:49.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...because they
don't understand, because I know

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:52.819 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
for a fact, if I went up to
any mother and I said I'm going

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:56.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to mix this PEG, I'm going to
mix a little oil from your car

00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:57.390 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
into this solution right here

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.691 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and I'm going to
mix brake fluid.

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:01.527 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You know these 40
propylene glycol anti-freeze

00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:03.729 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
in there and red dye number 13.

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:06.699 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
Do you mind if I put
that on your baby's skin?

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:09.402 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
I mean unless they are
psychotic or something, they --

00:16:09.402 --> 00:16:12.572 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
I'm sure they would
say, "No way."

00:16:12.572 --> 00:16:16.108 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
Yet because of the bright,
nice looking pink bottle...

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:17.176 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right.

00:16:17.176 --> 00:16:18.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...it must
be safe for my baby.

00:16:18.611 --> 00:16:23.583 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
It actually says
clinically proven mildness.

00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:25.618 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
Number one choice of hospitals.

00:16:25.618 --> 00:16:26.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
That just tells you...

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Ugh.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.255 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I mean, can
you believe that?

00:16:29.255 --> 00:16:30.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; Mike: No.

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Number one
choice of hospitals?

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:32.258 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Well look.

00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:34.627 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
Hospitals have McDonalds
in the hospital, all right.

00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:36.796 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
There's the heart
surgery hospital

00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:38.631 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
where you can get
McDonalds before

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.366 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
and after your heart surgery.

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:42.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's good for repeat
business, of course.

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:48.241 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Hospitals, for a long time,
they wanted women not to engage

00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:50.042 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
in breast feeding, and
they would feed infants

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:51.077 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
infant formula.

00:16:51.077 --> 00:16:53.279 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
Now that's changing
in some hospitals,

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:57.083 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but it hasn't been very long
that it's been changing.

00:16:57.083 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It was all infant formula,
like breast milk is bad.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And if you look at what
these products do to babies,

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:05.191 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
they also cause asthma.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.959 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And eczema and
psoriases and...

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:07.927 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Exactly.

00:17:07.927 --> 00:17:08.828 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...and rash on
their skin

00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:10.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and then they go
get another chemical

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:11.831 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
for the rash on the skin...

00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:13.199 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...that was caused
by the chemicals in the lotion

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.735 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
that they put on to begin with.

00:17:15.735 --> 00:17:17.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And I'll tell you
what, for my kids,

00:17:17.837 --> 00:17:19.372 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
I'll tell you a very simple

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:22.275 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and easy skin lotion
that you can make...

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Let's
get this out there.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: half, 50% organic
hemp oil, and 50% coconut,

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
raw virgin coconut
oil, which is a solid.

00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:31.884 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Good idea.

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You melt
it on low heat.

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:35.021 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
You can even add a little bit
of lemon grass oil in there,

00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:37.089 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
a little tea tree oil
in there that you --

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:41.294 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
which is great for
baby rash, diaper rash.

00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:42.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And then you don't
heat it up too much.

00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:45.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
You just heat it to
the coconut oil melts,

00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:48.334 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and then you mix the 50/50
hemp and coconut oil.

00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:50.836 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
You can put a little olive
oil in there too if you want.

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:53.572 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then it kind of solidifies
and you keep in a glass

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.241 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in the refrigerator,
a little glass thing

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:56.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and then you use that.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Absolutely.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: That way your baby
is getting all fresh, organic,

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:05.985 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
cold-pressed oils on their
skin, and their skin thrives.

00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:09.121 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: You don't want
the Vaseline on your kids,

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
a petroleum based product?

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:11.824 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
Look at that.

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:12.825 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:13.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; Mike: I mean,
it's incredible.

00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:16.162 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
The other thing that
people have to realize is

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:19.799 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
that these companies -- there's
only a handful of companies

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:23.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that manufacture all this stuff,
and these companies spend most

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:26.505 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
of their money on
marketing and propaganda,

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:28.975 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
because very little money
goes into the actual product.

00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:30.609 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
The ingredients are
dirt cheap, you know.

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:33.446 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
A barrel of oil is a
hundred bucks or something.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:36.749 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You can make a lot of Vaseline
out of a barrel of oil.

00:18:36.749 --> 00:18:39.185 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
So they don't spend money on
the product, they spend money

00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:42.121 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
on the propaganda to
convince gullible people,

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
impressionable people, who
aren't critical thinkers --

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.426 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
usually, that these
products are super healthy.

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:49.729 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They might have advertisements
on television

00:18:49.729 --> 00:18:52.832 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
with really healthy babies
and healthy looking people,

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:54.834 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
happy people, sunshine,
whatever,

00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:56.602 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
but they're actually
poisoning you.

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:57.703 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
This is dryer sheets.

00:18:57.703 --> 00:18:59.972 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
This one happens to
be the Gain brand,

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and we have this quarantined

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:06.612 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
in this polypropylene
water tight vessel

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:09.749 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because now it's permanently
in there, by the way.

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:10.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
I'm not letting it out

00:19:10.683 --> 00:19:11.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: It's
probably going

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.352 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to start melting here
pretty soon in the case.

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:15.821 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, because we can't
stand the smell of this stuff,

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.357 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but we want to be able to show
it to people on shows like this.

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:19.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
So that...

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:20.359 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: By the way...

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:21.394 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Mike: ...is in quarantine.

00:19:21.394 --> 00:19:22.595 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...a
natural replacement

00:19:22.595 --> 00:19:24.063 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
for fabric softeners, we
have these little cotton,

00:19:24.063 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a 100% organic washcloths,
and we just put a couple drops

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of a good essential oil on
those and throw it in the dryer.

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:31.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:32.171 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I mean,
you know...

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:33.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Use vinegar on cloth.

00:19:33.439 --> 00:19:34.507 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Lavender oil...

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:35.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:36.876 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...on a little
cloth and it's in there

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:37.977 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
with the dryer and your
clothes smell like --

00:19:37.977 --> 00:19:40.880 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that's natural lavender,
natural lemon grass,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.116 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
natural citrus flavor,
whatever you want to do

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and you don't have
all those chemicals.

00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:46.152 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: All right.

00:19:46.152 --> 00:19:47.453 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
Next one is air fresheners.

00:19:47.453 --> 00:19:48.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
There's been a lot
of research actually

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:52.191 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
on air fresheners causing
asthma, causing headaches,

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:55.461 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
causing different kinds of
problems that people have.

00:19:55.461 --> 00:19:56.295 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
You think about it.

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:57.563 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
You're taking toxic chemicals

00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:59.632 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
and you are intentionally
putting them into the air

00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
that you and your
family are breathing.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.335 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
I say ditch these
air fresheners.

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:05.104 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We should probably
quarantine this one too.

00:20:05.104 --> 00:20:06.605 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And instead, use
something like this.

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:09.475 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
This is a natural
orange citrus spray.

00:20:09.475 --> 00:20:13.612 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
It's just made from
citrus peel extracts.

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:14.814 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Mm-hmm.

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:15.881 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Mike: I mean there's
nothing artificial in it,

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.116 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
and you can use essential
oils as well.

00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:19.652 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
If you want your house to
smell better, you know,

00:20:19.652 --> 00:20:21.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
use something like that.

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:22.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: An aroma
therapy diffuser or something.

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:23.789 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Aroma therapy.

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:25.057 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And
you know another big thing is,

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
I tell people all the time
you know, you have to get rid

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.961 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
of the aluminum in your life.

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:32.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Aluminum is everywhere and you
wonder why women have fibrous

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:33.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
cystic breast disease.

00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:35.134 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
You know, that's an
iodine deficiency,

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:36.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but it's also aluminum
accumulates.

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:39.672 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
You know you put on all this
deodorant right under your arm.

00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:41.841 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
It's a very sensitive area.

00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:44.543 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
Everything gets absorbed
really easily under your arm.

00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:46.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It goes straight into
your lymphatic system.

00:20:46.879 --> 00:20:48.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Sometimes you get a swelling

00:20:48.514 --> 00:20:51.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of your lymphatic
system under your arm.

00:20:51.117 --> 00:20:53.219 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And these deodorants
are extremely toxic

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:57.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because they include aluminum,
the toxic form of aluminum.

00:20:57.356 --> 00:21:00.159 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
And not only aluminum,
that's the active ingredient,

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:02.695 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but we don't even know
the anti-perspirants

00:21:02.695 --> 00:21:04.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and all the other...

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.098 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Lots of chemicals.

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:08.267 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...you know, the
scenting agents that they use

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in there, and it's extra
effective protection,

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
but it's also extra effective
disease causing agent

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.908 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
at the same time.

00:21:15.908 --> 00:21:17.009 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Scary stuff.

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:19.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: So natural
replacements, you know,

00:21:19.245 --> 00:21:22.548 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
for the people that live on a
raw food diet and everything,

00:21:22.548 --> 00:21:24.116 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
I mean I went on
raw for a long time

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.785 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
and I had zero body
odor because I was...

00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:27.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah,
diet's so clean, yeah.

00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:30.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...I never
needed to use deodorant.

00:21:30.156 --> 00:21:31.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
And I barely
even use it now.

00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:34.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If I do, I'll use a spray like
this, which is just a natural --

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:37.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
it's paraben free,
propylene glycol free.

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:38.164 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
It's unscented.

00:21:38.164 --> 00:21:39.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
There's no perfumes in it.

00:21:39.832 --> 00:21:41.734 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
It's basically just a salt mix.

00:21:41.734 --> 00:21:44.236 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
It's got some aloe in it.

00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:45.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Mineral salts.

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:46.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: It's great. Yeah.

00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:48.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I mean mineral
salts work really good.

00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:49.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Also, I like this one.

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:54.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is from Dr.
Hauschka, Deodorant Fresh,

00:21:54.113 --> 00:21:56.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and it's got all kinds of
organic ingredients in it.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:57.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's fairly expensive,
but you know what,

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:01.954 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
I'd rather pay a little bit
more than have to pay later

00:22:01.954 --> 00:22:03.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
because I'm going to
the doctor's office

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:07.059 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
because I have some lymphoma or
something like that due to...

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:07.826 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right.

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:08.394 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...the deodorant.

00:22:08.394 --> 00:22:09.795 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
So the point...

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:11.163 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Super.

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.732 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...of the matter
is, don't use toxic deodorants.

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:18.137 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
Replace your toxic deodorants
with natural alternatives

00:22:18.137 --> 00:22:22.174 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
like salt or any
organic, natural deodorant

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:23.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that you can put under your arm.

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:24.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Absolutely.

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:25.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
That's critical.

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Now, let's go to this;
insect repellent.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
I've seen people spray
this insect repellent all

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
over their exposed skin.

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:35.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They spray it on their face,
their neck, their arms,

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
their legs and then they
think oh, I'm protected.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I can go -- and then they'll
put sunscreen chemicals

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:41.961 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
on top of that.

00:22:41.961 --> 00:22:43.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
It's unbelievable.

00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:46.031 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
People just -- they
poison themselves to no end

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:47.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
to go outside, you know.

00:22:47.499 --> 00:22:50.102 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Really? Is nature that dangerous
these days that you got

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:51.604 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
to coat your kid in this stuff?

00:22:51.604 --> 00:22:53.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Well look,
skin cancer started

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:55.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to develop once we started
putting stuff on our skin.

00:22:55.808 --> 00:22:56.809 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Mike: I'm telling you,

00:22:56.809 --> 00:22:57.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
it's not the sun
causing the skin cancer;

00:22:57.943 --> 00:23:00.212 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
it's all the crap
people put on their skin.

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:03.282 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So forget insect repellent
that's based on chemicals

00:23:03.282 --> 00:23:07.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
like DEET and use
natural insect repellants.

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:09.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
This one's called
Organic Bug Spray.

00:23:09.989 --> 00:23:13.058 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
It's based on clove oils
and lemon grass oils and...

00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:14.627 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Eucalyptus.

00:23:14.627 --> 00:23:15.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, eucalyptus.

00:23:15.294 --> 00:23:16.662 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
Here's another one.

00:23:16.662 --> 00:23:18.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Citronella oils.

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:19.131 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:20.666 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: These oils
are pleasant.

00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:22.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
They're safe for
the environment.

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:26.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They are derived in using
safe manufacturing methods

00:23:26.305 --> 00:23:29.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
versus DEET, which has to
come from a chemical plant

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:32.711 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that might explode one day and
have another type of you know,

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:34.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Bhopal disaster like
happened in India.

00:23:34.847 --> 00:23:35.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It killed a lot of people.

00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:37.116 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:23:37.116 --> 00:23:38.717 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Extremely toxic and
poisonous you know, and listen,

00:23:38.717 --> 00:23:41.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
mothers, I know you've
gone through this before

00:23:41.854 --> 00:23:43.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
because the teachers

00:23:43.122 --> 00:23:45.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in the classrooms have
bottles of this...

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:46.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh.

00:23:46.859 --> 00:23:48.427 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: and they spray the
kids down before they go outside

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:49.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to play on the playground.

00:23:49.862 --> 00:23:51.897 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I have to actually
write a letter

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:56.602 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and my kid has organic bug
spray that he carries with him

00:23:56.602 --> 00:24:00.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to school and the teachers are
instructed to make sure they use

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:03.842 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that and only that on my child
over there, and I know my kid --

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:04.977 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
I ask my kid, and
he goes, "Yeah,

00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:06.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the teachers spray every kid

00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:09.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
down with this stuff before they
go out to recess every day."

00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:10.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Unbelievable.

00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:11.817 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: It's about making
the difference and talking

00:24:11.817 --> 00:24:13.619 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
to the schools and talking to
the teachers and say listen,

00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
this is -- these are chemicals.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.824 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Mike: How is that not child
abuse, you know, to spray a kid

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:20.626 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
with chemicals like that.

00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:21.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
But let's move on.

00:24:21.927 --> 00:24:24.930 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
Weed killer; here's a safe
weed killer called Avenger,

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
like a super hero.

00:24:26.065 --> 00:24:27.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And that
will replace the Round

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:30.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Up that you have sitting in --
or your friends have sitting

00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:31.603 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
in the garage that they use

00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:32.905 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
to kill all the weeds
in their yard.

00:24:32.905 --> 00:24:36.275 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Exactly, and the
status to look for is OMRI.

00:24:36.275 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
This is a -- this
means it's safe to use

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.678 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
on organic food production.

00:24:39.678 --> 00:24:41.613 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
So if you look for this
little symbol here...

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:42.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: OMRI listed.

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:43.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Anything that's OMRI
listed is going

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.852 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
to be safe, or mostly safe.

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:49.321 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
I mean there are a few things
that maybe I wouldn't want

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:53.292 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
to use a lot, but they're
way safer than anything else.

00:24:53.292 --> 00:24:55.327 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
And then that same
company makes this product,

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:58.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
which is an insect killer.

00:24:58.097 --> 00:25:01.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So instead of having
poison traps and chemicals

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.402 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
around your kitchen
or your house

00:25:03.402 --> 00:25:05.003 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
if you've got insects
invading your house;

00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:07.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
maybe you have ants coming
in, you can use this.

00:25:07.606 --> 00:25:09.007 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
It's based on essential oils.

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:10.008 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
It's safe to be around.

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
It's safe for children.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.546 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
You can also just -- you
can really make your own.

00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:18.417 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
You can just use Borax and
you can mix Borax with honey,

00:25:18.417 --> 00:25:20.386 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
for example, and ants eat that.

00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:21.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
It kills the ants.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
You don't need deadly chemicals.

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:24.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
It's not a big deal.

00:25:24.123 --> 00:25:24.823 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:28%
You know...

00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:25.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:27.226 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike: ...the common
theme here Ed,

00:25:27.226 --> 00:25:29.795 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
is that you can make a lot of
your own products very simply

00:25:29.795 --> 00:25:31.597 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
by just combining
two ingredients.

00:25:31.597 --> 00:25:32.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You can.

00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:34.333 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Mike: But the industry
wants you to think you can't,

00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:36.802 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
that you have to depend on them
and keep buying their products.

00:25:36.802 --> 00:25:38.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And there's --

00:25:38.137 --> 00:25:39.538 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
look, there's enough stuff
out there on the internet now

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:41.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
where you can go
look for yourself.

00:25:41.073 --> 00:25:44.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Talking about toothpaste and how
many times people brush their

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:48.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
teeth, one of the things that
Mike and I say you have to avoid

00:25:48.013 --> 00:25:50.649 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
and you have to replace
with something natural.

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:54.052 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Fluoride is extremely damaging;
calcifies the pineal gland.

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:56.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We could go all day long talking
about the damaging effects

00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:58.991 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
of toothpaste and all
the fillers in there.

00:25:58.991 --> 00:26:01.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Mike brought some
natural replacements

00:26:01.193 --> 00:26:06.532 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and O3 essentials
toothpaste that you can use.

00:26:06.532 --> 00:26:07.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
You could use baking soda.

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:11.670 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You could use ozonated
olive oil works really good.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
There's a many natural
clay-based toothpastes

00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:17.609 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
out there, Xylitol
based toothpaste

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:19.244 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
for kids that they can use.

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:22.815 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Look for natural, organic
alternatives on your toothpaste

00:26:22.815 --> 00:26:25.083 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and get those taken care
of as soon as possible.

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:28.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And this
is ozonated jojoba oil

00:26:28.086 --> 00:26:30.389 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
with peppermint in it,
peppermint essential oil,

00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:33.125 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
so you can -- I mean, you
can imagine it tastes good

00:26:33.125 --> 00:26:34.760 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and it has all the
benefits of ozone,

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
which modern dentistry
is really starting to...

00:26:36.528 --> 00:26:39.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Ozone's incredible
for working with the teeth.

00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:40.265 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: All right.

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:41.066 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
Yeah, mouthwash, let's do that.

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Mouthwash.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.702 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
Again, this is a
common mouthwash,

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:46.738 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
contains toxic chemicals,
dyes, fluoride.

00:26:46.738 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
Make sure that you switch

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.275 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
over to a non-toxic
mouthwash, one that's...

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike: That's right.

00:26:51.477 --> 00:26:52.644 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: ...all natural
that has green tea extract

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:54.480 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
in it, freshens the breath.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
These have all natural
ingredients.

00:26:56.582 --> 00:27:01.220 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
It's about replacing toxic
things with non-toxic things.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.588 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: All right.

00:27:02.588 --> 00:27:06.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Speaking of that, you've got
healthy shampoo here versus --

00:27:06.592 --> 00:27:08.961 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
let's say not so
healthy baby shampoo.

00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:10.929 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Watch out any time
you see the word baby,

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:12.764 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
it probably has a lot
of chemicals in it.

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
So again, go -- read --

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.335 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
you know, read the
ingredients labels.

00:27:16.335 --> 00:27:20.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Make sure you're not buying
a little chemical concoction

00:27:20.072 --> 00:27:23.475 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
that you're -- especially for
shampoo because it's hot water.

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.576 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
You have steam.

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:27.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Your scalp is all --
the pores are opened up.

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:29.815 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
You can you know,
get this product.

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:32.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It absorbs very easily
into your body.

00:27:32.451 --> 00:27:33.952 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
So we're about to wrap this up,

00:27:33.952 --> 00:27:35.787 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
but let me just cover
cooking pans.

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:37.022 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Cooking
pans, big thing.

00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:37.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Big thing.

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:38.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: This
is a safe pan.

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:40.392 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
It's ceramic, but
you want to watch

00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:42.327 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
out for the non-stick pans.

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:45.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Those surfaces are
things that offgas

00:27:45.364 --> 00:27:47.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
chemicals that you
know, kill parakeets

00:27:47.366 --> 00:27:48.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and other birds in your...

00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:50.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, Teflon pans,

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:52.271 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
they emit extremely
dangerous vapors.

00:27:52.271 --> 00:27:53.605 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Well, that's the show.

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:55.941 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
Thanks for watching Secrets
to Health with Mike and Ed.

00:27:55.941 --> 00:27:57.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: It's your turn

00:27:57.042 --> 00:28:00.445 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
to do a home health
makeover in your house.

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:01.446 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:18%
