&gt;&gt; Mike Adams: Welcome
to Secrets

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.198 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
to Health with Mike and Ed.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:33.667 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
I'm Mike Adams of
NaturalNews.com.

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:34.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Edward Group:
And I'm Ed Group

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.436 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
with GlobalHealingCenter.com.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.805 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And today's episode,
as you may have already noticed,

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
is your pet health makeover.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:45.545 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
We're going to talk about pet
foods and pet care products

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.482 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and alternatives that are safer
than what you normally buy

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:51.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
at a store or are
offered by a veterinarian.

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah,
what's happened, Mike,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and I'm sure you get the
same questions all the time,

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
is we have pets these days
that are getting cancer.

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.327 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
We have pets getting arthritis,

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:02.963 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
pets that are getting
worms inside of them.

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:04.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
What has transpired?

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
What has happened?

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.402 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
What's happened is the pets
are eating the same stuff

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
that we're eating.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.838 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
And the pets are coming
down with the same diseases

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:15.175 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that we're eating and
many people are asking us,

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
what can we do for
our pet's health?

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
People are scared.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:20.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They don't know, you
know, pets are so small.

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They don't know how much of
things they can give their pets.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
They really don't.

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:25.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.586 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: The veterinarians
they're going to are just as bad

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
as the medical doctors
that we go

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
to because they're
not being not taught.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.426 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
And the pets are being
prescribed the same thing

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:34.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that we're being prescribed.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.163 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: This is
an important point.

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:38.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Let's even lead off with this.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.335 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
The veterinarian
industry has been taken

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:43.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
over by the pharmaceutical
companies

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:45.572 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
and by the pet food
manufacturers,

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.641 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
just like, sort of, human
food factories

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.844 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
and human pharmaceutical
companies making products

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.112 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:28%
for humans.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.382 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
The thing is that veterinarians
are now dispensing more

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:56.883 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
and more drugs.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:59.019 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They are giving pets
food that's made

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:02.522 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
with grains rather
than actual meats.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:06.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And pets are now getting these
diseases such as diabetes

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.794 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
and obesity and cancer at rates

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.998 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
that now mimic what
human beings are getting.

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:13.533 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
So we see this -- we see that
big pharma really has taken

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.936 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
over the veterinarian industry.

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And that's causing a
lot of damage to pets.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Well, it's a
money game, too, you know?

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:22.476 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I mean, you have over
50 percent of the dogs

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and cats these days are obese.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.814 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
You have people feeding
them the wrong foods.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
Again, you have all
the same conditions

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that are going on in humans.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
And you know, I'm a pet
lover and you're a pet lover.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
You have dogs.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:35.756 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
I have a dog.

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:39.760 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I make sure that my dog
is fed very nutritious things.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.663 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I use all natural
products with my dogs.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
If you have dogs and
cats, remember that dogs

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and cats are carnivorous pets.

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:52.072 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
They have a pipe-like
digestive system.

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:55.642 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They have hydrochloric acid in
their mouth that they secrete.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
They are meant to eat
raw meat in nature,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.714 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
in their natural setting.

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:01.715 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yes.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:02.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Dogs
come from wolves,

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and cats are feline, you know?

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:05.685 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
So I mean, they're hunters.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.522 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
They go out, they
actually kill their food.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.991 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
And it's living animals
which they kill.

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.560 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
I mean, every now and then, you
know, they have the sense --

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Mike: They'll drag home a rat

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:16.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
or a raccoon, in
my case sometimes.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.934 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But you know, they also have the
sense to go eat certain herbs

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
and certain plants
from time to time, too,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.872 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
to help them deworm
naturally and everything.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So that's what we're going
to share with you today.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.176 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
That's a really good point.

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:30.544 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
You know, even though
we're going

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:34.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to show you packaged foods here,
what we are really advocates

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:38.051 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
of bones and raw food also.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.921 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
There's a movement about, you
know, raw food, raw bones.

00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:42.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
And also keep in mind --

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.891 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
here's something else that
people don't talk about much.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:51.131 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Cats and dogs are both innately
designed to be awake at night

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and asleep during the day.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
So when you try to force your
dog to fit your human schedule,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.539 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to be awake during the
day and asleep at night,

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:02.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that is the opposite of what
they are biologically designed

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:02.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
to do.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:03.677 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
I mean, look coyotes.

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:04.678 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
When do coyotes come out?

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:06.513 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
At night. When do
wolves come out?

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:08.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
At night. When do cats hunt?

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:11.985 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
At night. They are night
creatures, not day creatures.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:13.687 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
So they're not lazy when
they're sleeping all day.

00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:17.090 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
They're actually in tune with
their own natural biorhythms.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.058 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: That's right.

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:19.259 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
That's a good point
that you make.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.395 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
And, you know, that's
something you should take

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.497 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
into consideration, you know?

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:24.431 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
Don't spoil your pet.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Let them get enough sleep.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.734 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
But talking about food.

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:30.237 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
That's the number one thing that
we're going to talk about today.

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:34.174 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And if you compare, Mike
and I want to just compare

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:39.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
like a real toxic type of food
with a natural type of food.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.481 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
And we're going to
start with dry foods.

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.717 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
I actually picked this up
at a convenience store.

00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:47.954 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
Now this is a lot of
food for about $4.59.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
But believe it or not,

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:53.827 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
most people can't
afford good pet food,

00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:56.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
so this is what they
feed their pet.

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:58.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And this is what they feed all

00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
of their dogs and
cats and stuff.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
And you know what?

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:02.969 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
Just one other thing
that was kind of shocking

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.540 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
to me was the fact that there
was a study done not too long

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.441 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
ago, and 70 percent

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:12.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of the people interviewed said
they would spend more money

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:15.081 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
on their pet's health
than their own health.

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: I'm not
surprised to hear that.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.319 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
Now, speaking of
money, this is a Castor

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and Pollux Natural
Ultramix pet food.

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:25.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's -- I believe it's
certified organic.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I'd have to check on that.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
But it has a lot more natural
and organic ingredients.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.568 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
I think this costs about
maybe $12 versus the $5 there

00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:36.503 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
for maybe a similar amount.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:37.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: So it's
kind of comparative --

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:38.772 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: It's about
double price.

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:39.739 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: -- with,
you know, organic food,

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.575 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
which is non-organic
food in humans.

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:42.475 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Exactly.

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:43.777 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Let's go ingredient by
ingredient.

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:45.045 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
What's your first ingredient?

00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:48.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: My first
ingredient is ground whole corn.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:48.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Corn!

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:49.983 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: GMO corn.

00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Now, I don't know what dog
was raised on ground corn,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.355 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
but that's the first
ingredient in this one.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Mike: I've never seen a
dog in a field chasing corn.

00:05:58.658 --> 00:05:59.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
That's never happened.

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:03.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Now the first ingredient
here is deboned beef.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:03.763 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
So it's beef.

00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:04.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
There you are.

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.665 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Okay.

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:06.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Well, you know, I don't
know if it's organic or not.

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:07.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: It's not organic.

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:08.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: But still, it's
better than whole ground corn.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:09.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:10.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: The next
is meat and bone meal.

00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Now, for people who don't know
what meat and bone meal is,

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with the USDA slaughterhouses,
that's a conglomerate

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.515 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
of all the heads, the hooves,
the intestines, the organs.

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Anything that's rejected

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and toxic gets all
mixed in together.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.155 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
And the pork gets
mixed in with the beef,

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:30.824 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
the chicken all that stuff.

00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:35.328 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
And it gets ground into a
meal and then dehydrated.

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:36.162 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Wow.

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And that's part

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.465 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
of this what your
dog or cat is eating.

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:39.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Whatever they
can't extract is pink slime,

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:40.533 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
in other words.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:41.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Okay.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.371 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
The second ingredient
here is pork meal.

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:45.138 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Okay.

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.539 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
And mine is soybean meal.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.943 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
So we have two of the most
damaging genetically modified

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:54.547 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
products in the first
three ingredients in mine.

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:56.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: All right, third
ingredient here is barley,

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
which is actually very
healthy for dogs in a,

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:00.153 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
you know, small percentage.

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:02.322 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
You wouldn't want to feed
them 100 percent barley,

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:04.024 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
but it's a good ingredient.

00:07:04.024 --> 00:07:05.925 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And my
next one is animal fat.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
But not only animal fat,

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:10.497 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
it's actually animal
fat preserved with BHA.

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:11.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Which is a toxic preservative.

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:13.366 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Mike: That's your
first chemical, yeah.

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:14.701 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:16.269 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Mike: All right, fourth
ingredient here is salmon meal.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.304 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:18%
Salmon.

00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:18.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And
mine is gluten meal.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:19.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Ew!

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Which we've talked

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
about on your shows
how damaging gluten is

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:23.009 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
to the digestive tract.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:24.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Gluten!

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:26.713 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Dogs would have a terrible time
with gluten and corn and soy.

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:27.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I mean, exactly.

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:28.915 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
What -- I mean, that's --

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: It's unbelievable.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.084 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: this dog is
going to be

00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:32.319 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
in the veterinary
office all the time

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:35.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
because the BT toxin alone
is going to burn holes

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
through the dog's
intestinal lining.

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.191 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And plus then they're
going to have skin issues

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.726 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
because they have
intestinal issues

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:41.161 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
because of those ingredients.

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:44.631 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
And you know, itchiness
and rashes and allergies.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
A lot of dogs have
chemical sensitivities now

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.368 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
because of the foods
that they're eating.

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:49.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We're not going to go
through the whole list, folks.

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:54.941 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
But just let me name the next
three ingredients here: Peas,

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
brown rice and sweet potato.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
All healthy things for pets.

00:07:58.678 --> 00:07:59.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
What have you got?

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.448 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, I'll
just read a few here, too.

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:05.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Wheat meal run, corn distiller's
dried grains, corn gluten meal,

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
animal digest -- you know,

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:08.855 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
I don't know what
animal digest is.

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Animal digest!

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.158 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Salt,
ground whole wheat.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Sounds like a
magazine about animals.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Vegetable
oil, caramel color

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.133 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
and we have yellow number
5 again, yellow number 6,

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:21.801 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
red number 40, blue number 2.

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:28.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And those are proven carcinogens
and cancer-causing agents --

00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:29.442 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Crazy.

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: -- for
human consumption,

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:32.912 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
approved for human consumption.

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:34.748 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Now this
has a preservative,

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:38.418 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but the preservative is rosemary
extract, which is really great

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:40.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
for preserving all
kinds of foods.

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
The cheap food has
chemical preservatives.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.059 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Well, I mean,
you know, I don't even know

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:48.495 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
if a mouse or anything would
even eat this because there's

00:08:48.495 --> 00:08:49.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
so many chemicals in it.

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:52.198 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
It's just probably
naturally preserved, but yes,

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.633 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
it has chemicals in it.

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:54.768 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Like formaldehyde?

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:56.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, it
wouldn't surprise me.

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:57.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
But --

00:08:57.604 --> 00:08:59.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Well, you mentioned
the BH -- what is it?

00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:00.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah,
I mentioned the BHA.

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:03.309 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
It's got calcium carbonate in
it and it's got zinc sulfate,

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:07.814 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
ferrous sulfate, and just a slew
of other synthetic nutrients.

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:11.284 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
See, what they do, and they
do this in human food, too,

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:12.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
when they enrich things.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:13.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:14.854 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And look at this,

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:17.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
it's field trial oral care
it's even got in there.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.791 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Field trial?

00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:18.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And --

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:19.759 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Like it's
an experiment?

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:20.693 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Like
it's an experiment.

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:22.028 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Mike: It's a clinical trial.

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.731 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
You have to mail in the results
that you dog experiences?

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And the sad
thing is the mislabeling

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
of this stuff.

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:28.968 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
I mean, look at this.

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
Complete nutrition.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
100 percent complete
and balanced nutrition

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:36.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
for health and wellness.

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:39.379 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
There's nothing about
health and wellness in this.

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:42.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
This is disease and death.

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: It's crazy.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Whereas this product
says no corn and no soy.

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:50.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So they actually do make a
point to avoid those two grains.

00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:53.827 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
I would say just as a general
rule for everybody watching,

00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:56.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
if you're shopping for
pet food, avoid pet food

00:09:56.463 --> 00:09:58.631 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
that contains corn and soy,

00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:00.166 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
including soybean
oil, by the way.

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yes.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.634 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
And look at this.

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It even says premium dog food.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Premium [laughs].

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:06.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: So anyway.

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:07.807 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And you know, it's the
same for cats, too.

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You want to just make sure
that you look at that.

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And this is a makeover show.

00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:12.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
So the first thing is --

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Okay.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.183 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: -- replace your
dog food or your cat food

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:19.652 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
with healthy, natural
replacements.

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:21.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And I just want to show
you guys one more thing,

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:23.957 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
because I took the
time to really research

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:27.093 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
and find what the
best dog foods are.

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:29.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And this is one that we
found, Dogs for the Earth.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.932 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
And the people that do this
really take their time.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:37.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And this has no corn, no
soy, no junk, no grain.

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:39.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
It's all organic meat.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
She mixes it all herself

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.476 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
and then she dehydrates
it into patties.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Wow.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.345 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And
it's incredible.

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:46.279 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
And it's great.

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
It even has kelp
powder for iodine.

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:49.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:50.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And
parsley in it as well.

00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:52.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So that's something you
might want to check out.

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:54.988 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: For your dog's
breath, parsley there.

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Okay, so, now let's
talk about dog treats.

00:10:57.557 --> 00:11:01.327 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
Because the FDA has
actually been mystified

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:06.065 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
by I think 600 dogs and
cats have been killed now

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:09.936 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
by pet treats that
are made in China.

00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:12.772 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And the FDA -- I actually wrote
about this on Natural News.

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:16.543 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But the FDA has tested these
pet treats for heavy metals,

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:18.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
for BPA, for melamine,

00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:20.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
which sometimes is found
in foods from China.

00:11:20.914 --> 00:11:22.115 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
They've tested the pet treats

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:24.784 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and they can't find
what's killing the dogs.

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:27.687 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
It has sickened thousands
of animals.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
And again, killed 600.

00:11:29.322 --> 00:11:32.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So what I have here,
and by the way,

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:35.428 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I'm not blaming this
particular brand.

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
This brand may be
perfectly safe,

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.998 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
but the reason I
chose this brand is

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:43.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because on the back it shows
that it's made in China.

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:46.172 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
So any time that you're
buying pet treats,

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
these are called Munchy
Sticks, chicken in the middle.

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:49.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
You know, Dingo brand.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:53.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Any time you're buying pet
treats, avoid pet treats

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.915 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
that are made in
China, in my opinion.

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:57.784 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
Again, this brand may
be perfectly safe.

00:11:57.784 --> 00:11:58.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
We don't know.

00:11:58.484 --> 00:11:59.552 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
We haven't tested it.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.721 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
But the treats that
are killing animals

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.357 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
that the FDA has issued a
warning about are treats

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:05.925 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
that are made in China.

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: What are the
ingredients in there, anyway?

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, yeah, check it out.

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.898 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: We have
rawhide, chicken, pork, water,

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:15.368 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
corn sugar, salt,
potassium sorbate,

00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:19.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which is a preservative, and
F, D and C red number 40.

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:21.007 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And all of these
are sourced from China.

00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:22.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And they're
sourced from China, exactly.

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Mike: So it's China pork.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.277 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:12:24.277 --> 00:12:25.979 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Which is fed
China GMOs and China soy,

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:29.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which is loaded heavy metals
because China's so polluted.

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:31.084 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: That's why
so many pets are sick

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.452 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
and lethargic all the time.

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:33.019 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, man.

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:34.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
It's terrible.

00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:35.355 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You
know, you know,

00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they have crampings, you know.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.859 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
They have digestive problems,
they have thyroid issues.

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:41.427 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
And we'll talk a little
bit about that later.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:45.732 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
But some healthy natural
snacks, because everybody loves

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:48.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to give their pets
snacks all the time.

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:50.003 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
These are some that
you brought today

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:51.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that you could show
us that are healthy.

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:52.538 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yes.

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:53.906 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
Here's one that is
USDA certified organic.

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:56.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is a Castor and
Pollux Company once again.

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:58.945 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
And this is organic dog cookie.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:01.814 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
A peanut butter-flavored
cookie that's wheat free.

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:04.617 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And guess what the first
ingredient here is?

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Organic chicken.

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:10.089 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And after that is organic
peas and organic brown rice,

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:11.457 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
organic oats and so on.

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:15.228 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
So this is a nice healthy snack
that you can give your dogs.

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:17.497 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
And see, made in the USA.

00:13:17.497 --> 00:13:19.399 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
That's something else
to really look for.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Now for those of
you who don't want

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:25.071 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
to feed your dog meat all the
time, you can do something

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
like this, a sweet
potato dog chew.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Sometimes dogs, especially
puppies, they just want

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:30.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to chew on something, right?

00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:34.514 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You know, I've got a lot
of dogs and I love them.

00:13:34.514 --> 00:13:35.915 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
And when they're young,
you know, they'll chew

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:38.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
on paint rollers and they'll
chew on, you know, door mats

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.620 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
and they'll chew on shoes
and boots and whatever.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So you just want to give
them something to chew on.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:43.956 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
This is safe.

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:44.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
This is made in America.

00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:46.659 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
It's called Sam's Yams.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.162 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's just sweet potato
that's dried.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.964 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
And, you know, it's a fun
treat for a dog chew on.

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:54.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
What's the ingredient,
uh, sweet potato.

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:54.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
That's it.

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:55.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
That's all there is to it.

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:56.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Very simple.

00:13:56.536 --> 00:13:57.837 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You know,
it's the simple foods

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.238 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
that are always the best.

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:02.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Whenever you start having this
slew of chemicals in there is

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:04.444 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
when it starts getting
more toxic and more toxic.

00:14:04.444 --> 00:14:09.248 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
It's hard for the human and
the pet to digest or to break

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:11.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
down multiple things at once

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:13.753 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
because you secrete
different enzymes for meats

00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:17.223 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and different enzymes for like
sweet potatoes or for grasses

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:18.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
or anything like that.

00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:22.161 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So when you add all that
together, it's a lot harder.

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:24.831 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
And sometimes those meats
can turn putrefactive.

00:14:24.831 --> 00:14:26.265 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
The fats can turn rancid.

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And the carbohydrates
can end up fermenting.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:32.138 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
And when that happens, it
just adds more chemicals

00:14:32.138 --> 00:14:33.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
to the system.

00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:35.374 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
You have to think,
what is this animal

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:37.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
or what do we eat in nature?

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.011 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right.

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You know,
what is the animal going

00:14:40.012 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
to eat in nature?

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.649 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Do you think the animal's going
to go dig up a sweet potato

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:46.352 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
or dig up -- they
might by itself.

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:49.055 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But do you think they're going
to have a big meal all at once

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.991 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
with a bunch of artificial dyes
and preservatives and sugar?

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:54.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
When's an animal ever going to
get refined sugar in their diet?

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:57.196 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: No, or refined
petroleum byproducts.

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:58.197 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I know.

00:14:58.197 --> 00:14:58.998 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And we don't
see drinking,

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:00.099 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
you know, crude oil, right?

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:01.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:02.401 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: That's not
going to happen.

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:04.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: This is one
that I like, Mike, right here.

00:15:04.137 --> 00:15:05.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And I have a little puppy.

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:07.907 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
And it's in chewing
mode right now.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.776 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
And I'm having all
my stuff chewed up.

00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:15.314 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And this is 100 percent
pure organic chicken treats.

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:17.683 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
And they're dehydrated, you
know, so you can throw them

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:19.786 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
in your suitcase if you
want to go somewhere.

00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:21.587 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
And my dog loves these.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.422 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
And they also make
them for cats, too.

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
So another good --

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:27.493 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Mike: It's just like a
dehydrated chicken breast

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:28.194 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
or something like that.

00:15:28.194 --> 00:15:28.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:29.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:15:29.562 --> 00:15:30.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Pretty healthy.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:32.765 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Here's another natural
organic treat

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for dogs, Five-Star Blueberry.

00:15:34.534 --> 00:15:38.437 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
Also grain free, USDA
organic and no wheat,

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:41.307 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
no corn, no soy, no GMOs.

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
I really like to see this on
the package, Ed, because more

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.145 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
and more companies
whether it's pet food

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
or people food are paying
attention to the GMO factor.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.119 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
And they're putting the
labels on their products.

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:56.222 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
We talked about the non-GMO
project verified before.

00:15:56.222 --> 00:15:59.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And by the way, I think
the next wave of awareness

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:01.727 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
on this is going to
be what is the level

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:03.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of heavy metals in the food.

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:05.398 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
I think a year from now a lot

00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:09.035 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
of companies will be claiming
things like low heavy metals,

00:16:09.035 --> 00:16:11.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
you know, verified or certified.

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:12.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Some kind of low heavy metals.

00:16:12.705 --> 00:16:14.807 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Because that's the one thing
that a lot of people don't know.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's not listed on the label,
but it's a very important factor

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:20.079 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
for your pet's health and
also for your own health.

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:21.314 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, those
are things that don't have

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:22.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to be listed on the label.

00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:24.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And some of the most
damaging things.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.319 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
I mean, you look at the
high levels of arsenic,

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.553 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
especially coming from China.

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:28.621 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah in chicken.

00:16:28.621 --> 00:16:30.423 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I don't
know of anybody,

00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:32.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
really that's been testing
dog products out there

00:16:32.792 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for heavy metal contamination.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.597 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I mean, there's no
regulations on that.

00:16:37.597 --> 00:16:39.532 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
There could be high
levels of cadmium.

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:40.366 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Exactly.

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:41.767 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Lead, you know?

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:43.703 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Most of the stuff anyway that
comes from China has lead in it.

00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:45.204 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: This is
a critical point.

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The FDA, following
its announcement

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that these pet treats
were killing so many dogs,

00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:52.345 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
they announced that they were

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:55.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
for the first time
initiating new regulations

00:16:55.248 --> 00:16:57.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that would require pet
food manufacturers,

00:16:57.717 --> 00:16:59.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
for the first time ever,

00:16:59.452 --> 00:17:03.589 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
to abide by basic
fundamental safety regulations.

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:05.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Now you might think, well gee,

00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:07.159 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
hasn't that been in
place before now?

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:08.527 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
The answer is no.

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:12.298 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
That a pet food manufacturer
can use anything in a product

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
with no testing whatsoever.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
That's bizarre, but that
also explains why pet food is

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.337 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
so dangerous.

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:20.506 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
I'm talking about
the cheap pet food.

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:23.409 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And there is high-end pet
food and low-end pet food just

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:25.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
like there's high-end,
you know, people food

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and low-end people food.

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:29.882 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
But the low-end stuff I have no
doubt, is killing animals all

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.618 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
across America and around
the world right now.

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:34.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: We know how
much people love their pets,

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:35.821 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
and that's why we're
here to try to help you

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:39.959 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
out because the sad thing
is, pets, by the time they're

00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:44.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
about two years old are on
the same pharmaceutical agents

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:46.832 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
as humans are because their
health is deteriorating.

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:48.567 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
And it happens a
lot faster in pets.

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:53.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
You know, seven years is how old
in human health to human age

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:55.675 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
to a one-year-old
dog or whatever.

00:17:55.675 --> 00:18:00.613 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So what we want to do is prevent
all those health conditions

00:18:00.613 --> 00:18:01.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
from happening with your pet

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:04.417 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
and utilize natural
replacements instead.

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:05.885 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, in fact,
the biggest growth area

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:08.387 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
of Prozac prescriptions
is in pets.

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:10.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And what about
vaccines and everything.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Are they doing flu
shots in pets yet?

00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:13.426 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, they're doing --

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:15.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
yeah, let's talk about
the vaccine issue

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:16.996 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
for just a moment here.

00:18:16.996 --> 00:18:19.465 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
Because I have a big
issue, a big disagreement

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:22.134 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
with veterinarians on vaccines.

00:18:22.134 --> 00:18:23.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The theory of vaccination says

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:28.908 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
that your immune system needs a
rehearsal, needs to be exposed

00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:33.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to these weakened virus
fragments, viral fragments, RNA,

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:35.781 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
in order for your immune
system to recognize those

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:39.719 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and then create antibodies,
which you have for life, right?

00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:42.455 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
That's why you only get
chicken pox once, normally.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.091 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
Then you're immune to
it for life, right?

00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
Well, why do they give your
dog a vaccine this year

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and then next year they tell
you you've got to come back in

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:53.833 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
and get the same vaccine
over and over and over again?

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:58.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's nothing more than
marketing propaganda, folks.

00:18:58.738 --> 00:19:01.741 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
Your dogs do not need
to be re-vaccinated

00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
with the same vaccines
year after year after year.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.879 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
This is killing animals
all across America.

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:08.414 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
It is not helping their health.

00:19:08.414 --> 00:19:11.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
What it's doing is creating
revenues for the veterinarians

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.219 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
to get your pets back
into their office

00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:15.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
where they can sell you
more heartworm medication,

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:17.857 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
which is also toxic, and
they can find other diseases,

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:20.026 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
they can sell you Prozac drugs,

00:19:20.026 --> 00:19:22.862 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
they can make money off
the vaccine booster shots

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:24.997 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
that they're trying to
get you to do every year.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
That's what the vaccines
are really all about.

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:27.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: It's big business.

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:29.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And I mean, who knows, you know,

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:33.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the amount of mercury that's
contained in vaccines.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.543 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And they're giving dogs
human doses of vaccines.

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:38.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
It's incredible.

00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:40.413 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
I mean, these poor dogs
are just sick all the time.

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:43.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So, you know, what I
used to do for my dog,

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:46.552 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and I never put my dog on
any heartworm medications.

00:19:46.552 --> 00:19:48.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What I use is a product
called diatomaceous earth.

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:52.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
All I did was -- it's a
great natural de-wormer.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:55.094 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
And people have used
it for livestock for,

00:19:55.094 --> 00:19:56.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you know, turn of the century.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:57.897 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
I mean, it's been
around forever.

00:19:57.897 --> 00:19:58.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, yeah.

00:19:58.831 --> 00:19:59.832 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And
what it does --

00:19:59.832 --> 00:20:00.499 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Mike: you're talking about
eating it.

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:01.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Eating it.

00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:03.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I just put a little bit on
their food and then they eat it.

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:06.539 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
Or you could use a --
you can use wormwood.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.607 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You know, I use this
product right here

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:09.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and it has wormwood in it.

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:12.378 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
It has black walnut hull in it.

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:15.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It has natural de-wormers in
it, which are completely safe.

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:17.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It's got some clove bud in it.

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:19.618 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
And just put a little bit
of that in your pet's food.

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:21.053 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
And it's all organic.

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.455 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
It's natural.

00:20:22.455 --> 00:20:25.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's a nat -- it's just as if
your pet is in nature and went

00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:27.660 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
and found a little bit
of wormwood and ate it.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.362 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
Or went and found, you know,
a black walnut and, you know,

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:32.331 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
chewed on it a little bit
or something like that.

00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:35.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And they get the
natural de-wormers

00:20:35.034 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
that they have inside
their system.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Mike: You know, let's talk
about de-worming for a minute.

00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:41.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Because I think this
is another huge scam

00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:42.641 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
that needs to be exposed.

00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:45.678 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Now, it is true that your
animals can get heartworms

00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
from mosquito bites,
for example.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.749 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
But the industry tries to
sell you these products

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:53.686 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
like Heartgard or
other little chews

00:20:53.686 --> 00:20:57.156 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
that contain a pharmaceutical
chemical called Ivermectin.

00:20:57.156 --> 00:21:00.626 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And this chemical blocks
the reproductive cycle

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:01.927 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
of the heartworms, that's true.

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:04.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
However, they sell you
these treats for as much

00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:07.333 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
as $5, $6, $7 dollars each.

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:09.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So -- and they try to sell
you one year's supply,

00:21:09.702 --> 00:21:12.438 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
you know, for $70 or something.

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:15.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
In truth, if you
go onto Amazon.com

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:18.744 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
or a local feed store,
you can buy 50 milliliters

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:23.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of an Ivermectin solution that's
sold for cattle and sheep.

00:21:23.048 --> 00:21:25.251 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
And you can take the
proper dosage of that

00:21:25.251 --> 00:21:29.255 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
with a simple syringe and put it
in your dog's food once a month,

00:21:29.255 --> 00:21:30.956 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
if you wanted to use that drug.

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You can do it for 50
cents instead of $5.

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:36.128 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
You could save 90 percent
of your expenditures.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:39.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
That's another example where
it's a huge profit margin.

00:21:39.265 --> 00:21:41.500 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
The vets are making
money on the product.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.435 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The drug companies are
making money on the product.

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:45.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
The consumer is getting screwed.

00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:47.006 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
You don't need to
spend that money.

00:21:47.006 --> 00:21:48.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
There are other ways to do it.

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:50.276 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
Or you could avoid
Ivermectin all together

00:21:50.276 --> 00:21:53.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and do what Ed's talking
about, black walnut extract.

00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:55.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Wormwood is another great one.

00:21:55.381 --> 00:21:59.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And finally, here's one here,
too, brewer's yeast with garlic.

00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:02.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I have my pets on this
product right here,

00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:03.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
which is just brewer's
yeast, garlic extract

00:22:03.923 --> 00:22:06.659 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
and zinc oxide mixed
together in little tablets.

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:07.960 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
Mix it with their food.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.063 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
Now I know people say that
you can't feed dogs garlic.

00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:12.531 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
It's bad for them, right?

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:13.499 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:28%
Not really.

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:15.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Onions are bad for your dog.

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:17.503 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
But garlic in these
small amounts,

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:20.573 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
it can be well-tolerated
and it has many benefits,

00:22:20.573 --> 00:22:24.076 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
including preventing ticks
and fleas at the same time.

00:22:24.076 --> 00:22:26.679 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, and you have
a toxic flea collar over here.

00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:27.780 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yes.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.547 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And a
tick collar over here.

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:29.548 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
And this is another thing

00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:31.016 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
that you're just
putting toxic chem --

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:34.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
your pet is actually
wearing this for 120 days.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.154 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Crazy.

00:22:35.154 --> 00:22:36.121 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And it's going --

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
pet skin is very
extremely sensitive.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.259 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
More sensitive than human skin.

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:43.095 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
So your pet will
literally absorb this

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:46.065 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
into their bloodstream
as long as they wear it.

00:22:46.065 --> 00:22:49.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And there are some good
remedies online for natural tick

00:22:49.668 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
and flea support that you can
use that I highly recommend.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Now DE --
let me talk about that

00:22:56.942 --> 00:23:00.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and share some experience
on my ranch here in Texas.

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The essential oils that
you put on a cloth collar,

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.919 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
just have a cloth collar,

00:23:06.919 --> 00:23:09.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
those in my experience did
not work by themselves.

00:23:09.088 --> 00:23:11.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But when I mix essential
oils with DE

00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:15.427 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
and I created an activated DE
powder with lemon grass oil

00:23:15.427 --> 00:23:18.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and clove oil and some other
things, then you sort of --

00:23:18.631 --> 00:23:21.500 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
you put in a bottle and you
kind of powder that on your dog

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.569 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
and kind of rub on their fur.

00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
That worked really well.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.006 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And it's totally
non-toxic, you know?

00:23:27.006 --> 00:23:28.474 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
You can pet your pet.

00:23:28.474 --> 00:23:30.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Your children can
be around your pets.

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:33.312 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
They can, you know, swim in a
pond and not poison the fish,

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:35.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which is, you know, you don't
want this getting into a pond.

00:23:35.714 --> 00:23:37.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It might be toxic to fish.

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:39.818 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
So that's another
solution that really works.

00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:41.954 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You know, and
one of the major problems also

00:23:41.954 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
out there, and it just made
me think that, you know,

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:49.862 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
when you feed your pet bad food,
and you combine the chemicals

00:23:49.862 --> 00:23:51.664 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
in the flea and tick collars,

00:23:51.664 --> 00:23:55.167 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
all of that together causes
other problems in the pet

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:56.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that you then have to treat.

00:23:56.402 --> 00:23:59.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
For example, bad food causes
severe dental problems

00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:01.273 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
in cats and dogs.

00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:05.344 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Cats and dogs in a natural state
shouldn't really have dental

00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:07.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
problems because they're
chewing up the bones

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:10.015 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
and the bone marrow
and all that stuff.

00:24:10.015 --> 00:24:12.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
But right now, you see
an increase in that.

00:24:12.518 --> 00:24:17.623 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
And not only that, you also
are seeing a massive increase

00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:23.562 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
in hyperthyroidism in cats
and hypothyroidism in dogs.

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:26.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And that's because of
the iodine deficiency.

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:28.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And so one of the ways
that you can remedy

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:33.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that real effectively is with
giving your pet some kelp powder

00:24:33.872 --> 00:24:38.444 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
or using a detoxified nascent
iodine and giving them,

00:24:38.444 --> 00:24:42.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you know, let's say 4 or 5
drops a couple times a week.

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:45.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And that iodine will prevent you
from having to have your pets

00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:48.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
on thyroid medications for the
rest of their life because --

00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:49.922 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Exactly.

00:24:49.922 --> 00:24:51.557 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Look, once
your pet is on medications,

00:24:51.557 --> 00:24:53.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they're never off medications.

00:24:53.258 --> 00:24:54.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Just like the human, you know?

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:56.862 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It doesn't address the
root cause of the problem.

00:24:56.862 --> 00:24:58.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It addresses the
symptoms of the problem.

00:24:58.464 --> 00:25:00.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Mike: That's the business
model of the drug companies.

00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
Keep your pet sick.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Keep you sick.

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Keep you buying overpriced
health insurance.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.538 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Keep you buying pharmaceuticals
over and over again.

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:09.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Before I put this away, this
flea, this chemical flea collar,

00:25:09.408 --> 00:25:11.009 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
I just want to read this.

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
It has a poison warning.

00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:16.515 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Call a poison center or a doctor
immediately for treatment advice

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:18.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
if you swallow part of this.

00:25:18.417 --> 00:25:20.753 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
So, you know, that's a
pretty good sign right there.

00:25:20.753 --> 00:25:24.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If you have to have a poison
center warning on something

00:25:24.923 --> 00:25:28.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that your dog is going to wear
around their neck, really?

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:30.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Then that's way too toxic.

00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:32.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
So avoid that.

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:34.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And then not
only that, but you know,

00:25:34.133 --> 00:25:35.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
if you have kids
around the house

00:25:35.501 --> 00:25:37.736 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
and your kids are sitting
there touching your dog.

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The dog is sleeping on your kids
and you have all that chemicals

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.544 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that could possibly be
coming into your kids' skin.

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:46.879 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, right.

00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:49.148 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And another thing
is that the toxic shampoos

00:25:49.148 --> 00:25:50.549 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
and the toxic conditioners.

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:53.552 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
I mean,
people for pets, you have

00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:55.487 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
shampoos for curly-haired dogs.

00:25:55.487 --> 00:25:57.523 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
You have shampoos,
whitening shampoos.

00:25:57.523 --> 00:26:02.828 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
You have all these different
types of chemical-based shampoos

00:26:02.828 --> 00:26:07.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and conditioners for dogs
that leave a film on the hair.

00:26:07.099 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, they're terrible.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.435 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And then
dogs and cats shed.

00:26:09.435 --> 00:26:12.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then you have the
sheddings all over the floor

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:15.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and everything, which are
just more toxic compounds.

00:26:15.841 --> 00:26:18.277 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And they're loaded
with fragrance chemicals.

00:26:18.277 --> 00:26:22.381 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
I don't know why when people
take their dogs to, you know,

00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:24.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
a pet store to be groomed.

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Every time they come back they
smell like a perfume bomb.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.823 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I guess a lot of consumers think
that that means they're clean.

00:26:30.823 --> 00:26:34.193 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
No. They have been poisoned
with that fragrance.

00:26:34.193 --> 00:26:35.327 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
Think about it.

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:37.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Dogs and cats, they have
a greatly enhanced sense

00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:38.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of smell compared to humans.

00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:41.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So to them, that's
a like a bomb.

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:44.002 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
That's like a gas
attack on them.

00:26:44.002 --> 00:26:46.772 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
But owners are subjecting
their pets to that unknowingly.

00:26:46.772 --> 00:26:49.141 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
If you take your
pet to a groomer,

00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:52.578 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
make sure they use
fragrance-free shampoos

00:26:52.578 --> 00:26:53.846 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
or other cleaning products.

00:26:53.846 --> 00:26:55.347 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Or just
use them yourself.

00:26:55.347 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
I mean, here's a couple
good organic shampoos.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.618 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
These are for humans,
but I mean,

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.587 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
they're completely safe
to use on pets, too.

00:27:01.587 --> 00:27:03.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
It's the Max Green
Alchemy brand.

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:05.257 align:middle line:85% position:54% size:68%
This is the one that I use.

00:27:05.257 --> 00:27:07.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
And I love it.

00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:09.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
So I use that on my dog as well.

00:27:09.094 --> 00:27:12.331 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
But another thing you
can do for the teeth

00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:16.602 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of the dog is iodine --
also is great for the teeth.

00:27:16.602 --> 00:27:18.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And one mistake people
make, Mike,

00:27:18.704 --> 00:27:22.307 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
is they actually brush
their teeth of the dog

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
with fluoride-based toothpaste.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, really.

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:28.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And fluoride is
extremely damaging to animals.

00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:30.883 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And it can poison
animals really fast.

00:27:30.883 --> 00:27:32.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Absolutely.

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:33.252 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Another
thing we didn't talk about.

00:27:33.252 --> 00:27:35.621 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
We talk about this all
the time, is tap water.

00:27:35.621 --> 00:27:38.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Feeding your dog and
your cat tap water.

00:27:38.524 --> 00:27:40.492 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You ever notice, you know,
I talk to some people

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:42.661 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
and they say, well my dog
won't drink the water.

00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:46.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But then he goes outside and
drinks water from the puddles.

00:27:46.198 --> 00:27:49.701 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
And they're saying, well here
I'm giving my dog clean water

00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:51.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and they're going out and
drinking that dirty water.

00:27:51.537 --> 00:27:53.539 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Mike: No, rainwater is
cleaner than the city water.

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:54.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:56.375 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
They actually know that
there's chlorine and fluoride

00:27:56.375 --> 00:27:59.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and arsenic and lead and all the
other stuff in the tap water.

00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:01.813 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
I mean, dogs and cats
have a sixth sense.

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:03.715 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
I mean, they actually
know a lot more

00:28:03.715 --> 00:28:05.384 align:middle line:85% position:55% size:73%
than what we think they know.

00:28:05.384 --> 00:28:06.952 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Hey, let's talk
about costs here for a second

00:28:06.952 --> 00:28:09.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because a lot of people are
suffering under the illusion

00:28:09.488 --> 00:28:12.491 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
that it costs more
money to treat your pet

00:28:12.491 --> 00:28:13.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
with natural products.

00:28:13.792 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
Not necessarily true.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.496 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
Take this DE for example,
diatomaceous earth.

00:28:17.496 --> 00:28:21.667 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
At any feed store you can
buy massive bags of DE,

00:28:21.667 --> 00:28:24.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
35 pound, 50 pound bags.

00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:27.306 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
And you can use it on your
garden for organic gardening.

00:28:27.306 --> 00:28:31.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It gets rid of insects and
pests and aphids on, you know,

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:32.978 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:43%
salad greens and
things like that.

00:28:32.978 --> 00:28:34.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
You can use it on
your dog by mixing

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:36.281 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
in some essential oils with it.

00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:41.186 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
You can even use it around your
house as a natural insecticide.

00:28:41.186 --> 00:28:42.821 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
There's so many different
uses for it.

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:44.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
And it's dirt cheap.

00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:47.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I mean, it's literally mined out
of the earth kind of like dirt.

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:48.327 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:43%
It's super cheap.

00:28:48.327 --> 00:28:50.329 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
And it has a multitude of uses.

00:28:50.329 --> 00:28:52.431 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
So don't think you
have to spend a fortune

00:28:52.431 --> 00:28:55.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to treat your pets
in a healthy way.

00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:57.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It can actually be cheaper
than buying the chemicals.

00:28:57.502 --> 00:29:01.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: The most expensive
part about pets are taking them

00:29:01.373 --> 00:29:03.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
in because they're
sick all the time.

00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:03.875 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right.

00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And, you know,

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:06.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
what you could do is you
could prevent yourself

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.380 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
from spending thousands
and thousands and thousands

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
of dollars by just spending
and taking a little bit of time

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.685 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:53%
to make sure your pet
is eating healthy.

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:16.188 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Mike, I just had someone
on the phone the other day

00:29:16.188 --> 00:29:21.159 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
that spent $4000 on the
first round of chemotherapy

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:24.296 align:middle line:79% position:54% size:68%
for their dog to go through
because of the tumors.

00:29:24.296 --> 00:29:25.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oh, really.

00:29:25.364 --> 00:29:26.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And
cancer is a huge problem

00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:28.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
with pets right now.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So what we're trying to tell you
here is it's time to prevent --

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:32.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Absolutely.

00:29:32.738 --> 00:29:33.739 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: -- disease.

00:29:33.739 --> 00:29:34.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's all about prevention,
you know?

00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:37.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Don't spend the rest of
your life taking your dog in

00:29:37.209 --> 00:29:39.678 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and having a sick
dog and a sick cat

00:29:39.678 --> 00:29:42.414 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
when you can easily reduce
the amount of toxins,

00:29:42.414 --> 00:29:45.584 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
disease-causing agents
coming in and making sure

00:29:45.584 --> 00:29:46.718 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
that your pet is healthy.

00:29:46.718 --> 00:29:48.053 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: You know, it's
just like with humans.

00:29:48.053 --> 00:29:50.255 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If you spend a little bit of
money up front on prevention

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:53.191 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and nutrition, then you're not
going to have to spend a fortune

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:56.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
on the backend on disease
treatment, cancer, chemotherapy,

00:29:56.762 --> 00:29:59.131 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
psychiatric drugs, you name it.

00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:01.333 align:middle line:79% position:52% size:48%
You know, it's just
keep it simple.

00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:02.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Keep it natural.

00:30:02.334 --> 00:30:03.902 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And your pets will
thank you for it.

00:30:03.902 --> 00:30:04.970 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Take care
of your pets today.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:05.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Thank you.

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:07.506 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Thank you.

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:08.507 align:middle line:85% position:52% size:23%
