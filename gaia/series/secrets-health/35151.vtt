I'm Mike Adams with
Natural News.

>> Mike: And today's episode
is Toxic Beverages Exposed,

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:90%
and as you can see here in front

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.179 align:middle line:84%
of us we have a lot
of beverages.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:46.747 align:middle line:84%
You may think, well,
those aren't toxic;

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:47.948 align:middle line:84%
those are sold everywhere,
right?

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:50.151 align:middle line:84%
How could they possibly
be toxic?

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:51.585 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look at
most of these sodas,

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.989 align:middle line:84%
they contain an ingredient
called phosphoric acid

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.058 align:middle line:84%
and Ed here is going to tell
you a lot more about this acid.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well,
you know, first of all,

00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:00.528 align:middle line:90%
you have to back up, Mike,

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:04.198 align:middle line:84%
I consider that most people
consume by weight more beverages

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:05.566 align:middle line:90%
that they could do food.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.735 align:middle line:84%
You know, I go to
restaurants and I see people

00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:12.006 align:middle line:84%
with this much food and forty
two ounce, thirty two ounce,

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.141 align:middle line:84%
sixty four ounce
cups of beverages

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.943 align:middle line:90%
and people are dehydrated,

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:19.647 align:middle line:84%
and people are consuming massive
amounts of toxins in beverages,

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:21.682 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to go
over today, but, Mike,

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:24.118 align:middle line:84%
phosphoric acid is
extremely damaging.

00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:27.955 align:middle line:84%
It's an acid that literally
can eat away the inside

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.156 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:32.226 align:middle line:84%
Phosphoric acid is used
to remove rust from metal.

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:35.563 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, we have a MSDS
type of sheet showing some

00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:39.233 align:middle line:84%
of the dangers of phosphoric
acid and as you can see here,

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:42.536 align:middle line:84%
when you're around phosphoric
acid, you need to use boots,

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:45.072 align:middle line:84%
apron, gloves, and
so on and so forth.

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:47.508 align:middle line:84%
Now, we actually do have
phosphoric acid here

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:48.641 align:middle line:90%
on the table.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.579 align:middle line:84%
It's in almost every one
of these popular sodas,

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.081 align:middle line:84%
name brand sodas,
everything from Coca Cola,

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.983 align:middle line:90%
Pepsi products, generic sodas.

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:57.685 align:middle line:90%
It's listed right on the label.

00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:01.255 align:middle line:84%
Phosphoric acid is dangerous,
but you're drinking it.

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:02.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And you know
how hard your bones are

00:02:02.823 --> 00:02:04.758 align:middle line:84%
in your body, and you know
how hard your teeth are.

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:07.694 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the teeth, they're so
hard because you have to chew

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.629 align:middle line:90%
through things on a daily basis;

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.765 align:middle line:84%
hopefully you're eating
three nutritious meals a day,

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:15.536 align:middle line:84%
but recently you did
an experiment, Mike,

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:17.905 align:middle line:84%
with phosphoric acid and
you took some pig teeth.

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:19.139 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about that?

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, in fact I
have those teeth right here.

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:22.509 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to
video in a second.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:26.614 align:middle line:84%
This is a set of teeth
from a wild pig in Texas.

00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:28.883 align:middle line:84%
We didn't kill the pig
to make this video;

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:29.984 align:middle line:90%
the teeth were harvested

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:32.386 align:middle line:84%
after he was already
dead; just so you know.

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:37.224 align:middle line:84%
We bathed these teeth in
a bath of phosphoric acid,

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:40.194 align:middle line:84%
eighty five percent
pure phosphoric acid,

00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:42.062 align:middle line:90%
and here's what happened.

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:44.431 align:middle line:84%
As you look at these photos
and video, check it out.

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:47.268 align:middle line:84%
This is the tooth
before the acid bath.

00:02:47.268 --> 00:02:50.771 align:middle line:84%
You can see here that the
tooth is mostly intact;

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:53.607 align:middle line:84%
it has a hard durable
surface, more of a smooth type

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:56.175 align:middle line:84%
of surface; this is
an undamaged tooth.

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:57.611 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And by
the way, these are twice

00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:59.013 align:middle line:90%
as big as a human tooth.

00:02:59.013 --> 00:03:00.314 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:03.417 align:middle line:84%
Now, check out what happens
when we add the acid.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:07.054 align:middle line:84%
This is now the tooth in an
acid bath, and as you can see,

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:11.392 align:middle line:84%
it's off gassing; it's
actually producing a gas as part

00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:14.862 align:middle line:84%
of the chemical reaction of
the phosphoric acid reacting

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:17.298 align:middle line:84%
with the calcium
base tooth enamel.

00:03:17.298 --> 00:03:20.301 align:middle line:84%
Now, teeth are calcium base, but
not a hundred percent calcium,

00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:22.703 align:middle line:84%
as you know, there are other
minerals involved as well,

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:25.072 align:middle line:84%
but as you can see in this
video, the calcium starts

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:90%
to come off the tooth.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.176 align:middle line:84%
You can see little bits
of calcium floating freely

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:31.812 align:middle line:84%
in the phosphoric
acid, and then finally,

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:35.115 align:middle line:84%
check out this video
after the acid bath.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Look at the tooth now.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.286 align:middle line:84%
The surface is molded
[phonetic] padded.

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:42.156 align:middle line:84%
The structure integrity
has been destroyed

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:45.326 align:middle line:84%
by the phosphoric acid; and
remember as you see this,

00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:48.262 align:middle line:84%
this is the same acid
that's used in sodas.

00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:50.898 align:middle line:84%
It's just at a higher
concentration in these videos,

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:52.833 align:middle line:90%
but it is the same substance.

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:55.302 align:middle line:84%
Now this tooth has no
structural integrity.

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.571 align:middle line:84%
So now only that-that
was only this tooth.

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:59.807 align:middle line:84%
We have it right here,
and if you put this tooth

00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:02.076 align:middle line:84%
under the microscope, you
will see the same thing.

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:05.112 align:middle line:84%
This is way dentists-this is one
of the reasons why dentists say,

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:07.648 align:middle line:84%
don't drink sodas, but a lot
of people add their focus

00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
on the high fructuous
corn syrup,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.753 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes the aspartame
but here we're teaching you

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.655 align:middle line:90%
about the phosphoric acid.

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.523 align:middle line:84%
That's the ingredient
that's normally not talked

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:17.958 align:middle line:90%
about in sodas.

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely,
and the thing is,

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:90%
when you combine phosphoric acid

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.864 align:middle line:84%
with a high fructuous
corn syrup,

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:26.834 align:middle line:84%
that's a breathing
ground for bacteria.

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:31.238 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you have the high
levels of sugars in the mouth,

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:34.108 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the acids
eating little tiny holes

00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:36.043 align:middle line:90%
in the teeth, well, guess what?

00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:38.545 align:middle line:84%
Those bacteria can get
in there, they can live,

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:40.347 align:middle line:90%
and then they cause cavities.

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:42.683 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
leading reason why there's

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:45.753 align:middle line:84%
so many cavities and
dental problems that we deal

00:04:45.753 --> 00:04:47.121 align:middle line:90%
with today with children-

00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:49.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And you know,
children consume seventy five

00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:51.558 align:middle line:90%
to a hundred pounds-

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Not only
children, by the way,

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:57.464 align:middle line:84%
the average person consumes up
to a hundred pounds of sugars,

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
high fructuous corn
syrup a year.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, speaking
of children-

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:02.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That's more
than they weight by the way.

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: I know.

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:04.838 align:middle line:84%
It's like eating your
body weight in sugar.

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:07.641 align:middle line:84%
This is an ad from the
nineteen fifty's that was run

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.276 align:middle line:90%
in a mainstream magazine.

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:13.113 align:middle line:84%
It shows Seven Up being
marketed to a toddler.

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:13.947 align:middle line:90%
This child is-what?

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:15.315 align:middle line:90%
Maybe three five years old,

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:84%
something in that
range, maybe four-

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.718 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Probably
about three.

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:18.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Three?

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.222 align:middle line:84%
And the - gripping a Seven
Up bottle, looking a lot

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:25.325 align:middle line:84%
like a baby bottle,
and the title is "You

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:90%
like it, it likes you.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.295 align:middle line:90%
The all family drink.

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:29.296 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that wonderful?"

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:30.798 align:middle line:90%
And down here it says,

00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:35.002 align:middle line:84%
"Mom knows sparkling crystal
clear Seven Up is so pure,

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:39.106 align:middle line:84%
so good, that folks of
all ages, even little guys

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:41.642 align:middle line:90%
like you, can enjoy it often."

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:46.513 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was being done before
we realized across the board

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.815 align:middle line:84%
that sodas like these
are strongly correlated

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:52.653 align:middle line:84%
with diabetes and obesity, and
now there's even more research

00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:54.988 align:middle line:84%
that diabetes is
linked to cancer

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:57.024 align:middle line:84%
and diabetes is linked
to heart disease.

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:59.626 align:middle line:84%
So when you're consuming
high fructuous corn syrup,

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.895 align:middle line:84%
which we'll talk about
in more detail, aspartame

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:04.531 align:middle line:84%
and diet sodas, and also the
phosphoric acid that we're going

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.334 align:middle line:84%
to even demonstrate some of this
here for you in this beaker,

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:10.838 align:middle line:84%
when you consume all of
those things, you are setting

00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:15.742 align:middle line:84%
up your body to be attacked by
not just bacteria in your mouth

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:19.346 align:middle line:84%
but by chronic degenerative
disease conditions.

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:20.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: That's right.

00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so damaging that
people don't even realize-

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.954 align:middle line:84%
you know, I do a lot of
research and talk to people all

00:06:26.954 --> 00:06:29.156 align:middle line:84%
over the place, and the
fact of the matter is,

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:31.492 align:middle line:84%
they're drinking more of
this than they are water.

00:06:31.492 --> 00:06:33.861 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at what
the body is made of.

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the body is eighty
to ninety percent water,

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.633 align:middle line:84%
the earth is eighty percent
to ninety percent of water,

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:43.737 align:middle line:84%
every living thing is eighty
to ninety percent water, yet,

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:47.541 align:middle line:84%
instead of the marketing
campaigns out there saying,

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.177 align:middle line:84%
drink more water,
drink more pure water,

00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:84%
what we have is a
complete diversion away

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.683 align:middle line:84%
from what the body needs and
something that is being pushed

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
on to children and adults,
something high in sugar,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.122 align:middle line:84%
and something completely
damaging to your body;

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:04.558 align:middle line:84%
something that's going to
cause an immune response,

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and you know, Mike,
I didn't even know,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.228 align:middle line:90%
my parents didn't know either,

00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:10.397 align:middle line:84%
and I was fed this
stuff growing up.

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:11.498 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Sure.

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:12.332 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean,
I had to learn later

00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:13.033 align:middle line:90%
on [inaudible] What about you?

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:14.034 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:15.102 align:middle line:84%
I was raised on a
lot of this stuff,

00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:90%
but look, let's go to the demo.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.005 align:middle line:90%
Let's make our sport drink

00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:84%
because you see this
product right here,

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.742 align:middle line:90%
this is called Powerade.

00:07:21.742 --> 00:07:24.111 align:middle line:90%
You notice the color is blue.

00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.179 align:middle line:84%
Well, probably- I mean,
when I was growing up,

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
this color was window cleaner,
and now it's a sports drink.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.252 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be surprised
if they have some

00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:35.122 align:middle line:84%
of the same ingredients,
but actually this is made

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:37.558 align:middle line:90%
with artificial food coloring.

00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:38.892 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to talk
about that in a minute,

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:84%
but let's make our own
imitation- imitation drink.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Well, you know,

00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:47.234 align:middle line:84%
this here is elevated
flavor too,

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:50.137 align:middle line:84%
and it says Melton
[phonetic] berry blast.

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:52.806 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they have
all these different colors is

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:55.742 align:middle line:84%
because people respond
differently to colors every day.

00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:59.546 align:middle line:84%
Like, one day, when you're
going in for a sports drink,

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:01.715 align:middle line:84%
your body might need
the color blue

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:03.216 align:middle line:84%
from the fito [phonetic]
chemicals or something

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:05.519 align:middle line:84%
and you choose the
blue drink today.

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.754 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow you might
choose the yellow drink

00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:09.756 align:middle line:90%
or the lime neon drink.

00:08:09.756 --> 00:08:11.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: But they're
tricking your mind;

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:12.392 align:middle line:90%
these colors are fake.

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It's
tricking your mind.

00:08:13.527 --> 00:08:16.263 align:middle line:84%
It's a diversion; it's
not that it has berries,

00:08:16.263 --> 00:08:18.632 align:middle line:84%
blueberries from up in
the mountain by all means.

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:19.666 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's right,
that's right.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:20.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So how
do they make this?

00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:21.401 align:middle line:90%
How do they make this?

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:22.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, let's
start with water.

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:23.170 align:middle line:90%
You're wearing the gloves

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.404 align:middle line:84%
so I'll let you handle
food coloring,

00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:25.772 align:middle line:90%
but let's start with water.

00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:27.207 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: OK, so
first they're going

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:28.308 align:middle line:90%
to start with water.

00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:30.243 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we don't
even know what kind

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:31.979 align:middle line:90%
of water they're even using.

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Tap water.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It doesn't say
distilled water on there,

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:35.782 align:middle line:84%
which it would mean it would
be a pure form of water.

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:36.849 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right, no.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.251 align:middle line:84%
this is just tap water;
it's toilet water.

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the same water that's in
your toilet, but it's filtered.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: OK, so we
have some water.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.792 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So usually
the first ingredient listed

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:47.661 align:middle line:84%
on the label is high
fructuous corn syrup, Mike,

00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:48.962 align:middle line:84%
because they have to
make it taste good.

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:51.298 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is going to drink it
if it doesn't taste good.

00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:52.299 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It's got to be sweet.

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be sweet.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I mean,

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
we've developed extreme
sweet sensors this days.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Here we go.

00:08:58.071 --> 00:08:58.839 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Do you
want to open that for me

00:08:58.839 --> 00:08:59.806 align:middle line:90%
without spilling it on me?

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:01.274 align:middle line:90%
OK, we want to make sure none

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:04.211 align:middle line:84%
of this was contaminated
for the camera.

00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's add some
of this corn syrup.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.119 align:middle line:84%
You can see that going
in, wobbling it in.

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:15.622 align:middle line:84%
We want to make sure
the FDA requires

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:21.228 align:middle line:84%
that you list the ingredients on
the label as to the percentage

00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:23.497 align:middle line:84%
of the ingredient
going down the label.

00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:25.632 align:middle line:84%
So usually, when you
see the first ingredient

00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:27.467 align:middle line:90%
on the label, that means that-

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:28.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's the
most prominent.

00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That's the most
prominent ingredient in there.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.539 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Alright, let's go for
the color next because we have

00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:34.408 align:middle line:90%
to make it look very blue.

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:37.444 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yes because
nobody would drink, would they?

00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:38.478 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:39.613 align:middle line:90%
Maybe if it's very sweet enough.

00:09:39.613 --> 00:09:40.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: If you give
them five box,

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
they probably would
[laughs] the fruit coloring.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So it only takes
a tiny amount of food coloring.

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:48.722 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can make this as
dark or as light as you want,

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:51.825 align:middle line:84%
but let's go ahead and put
a drop of that in there,

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:56.263 align:middle line:84%
and as you can see it's
changing its color.

00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:57.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Alright.

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:59.066 align:middle line:90%
Now, Ed, we need electrolytes.

00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:01.001 align:middle line:90%
That's just common salt.

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:02.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yes,
synthetic vitamins

00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:06.006 align:middle line:84%
or salt is what they
add for added minerals,

00:10:06.006 --> 00:10:07.574 align:middle line:84%
which are supposed
to do your body good,

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:08.875 align:middle line:90%
but, you know what, Mike?

00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:11.511 align:middle line:84%
Most of these minerals
that they add, actually,

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:13.914 align:middle line:84%
deplete the mineral
from your body.

00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:14.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:10:14.681 --> 00:10:16.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: For example,

00:10:16.016 --> 00:10:18.752 align:middle line:84%
calcium carbonate actually
takes calcium from your body.

00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:21.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I think-I think our
sports drink is more nutritious

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:23.924 align:middle line:84%
than Powerade because
it's deeper blue.

00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:25.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I think so too.

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:26.693 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm really
more sold on this one.

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:28.795 align:middle line:84%
If I had to choose, I'd
probably choose this one.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It's obviously
more nutritious.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: But, Mike,
I don't want the calories.

00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:33.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Oh, you
wanted the diet?

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:33.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I want
the diet drink.

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: No way, yes.

00:10:35.402 --> 00:10:37.137 align:middle line:90%
Guess what I have for you.

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Citric acid?

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:40.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: No, not the
citric acid; that's next.

00:10:40.107 --> 00:10:40.807 align:middle line:90%
Aspartame.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:41.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Aspartame.

00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:42.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: So now we have-

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:43.577 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: This is for diet.

00:10:43.577 --> 00:10:45.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Ninety nine
percent- oh, man,

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:48.014 align:middle line:84%
this is great-ninety nine
percent pure aspartame.

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:49.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Ooh, look at
the [inaudible] of that.

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: [inaudible] I don't
even want to get close to that.

00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:52.986 align:middle line:84%
Give us a little
[inaudible] of aspartame-

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Now, for people

00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:55.956 align:middle line:84%
that don't know what
aspartame, aspartame is saying-

00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's a
lot, that's a lot.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.059 align:middle line:90%
It's pure, man.

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That's as much
how much is ad in there.

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:05.365 align:middle line:84%
One packet of Nutra
Sweet contains-

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:06.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, but
isn't there [inaudible]

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.334 align:middle line:90%
that they mix in the-

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: They
do mix [inaudible]

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:09.636 align:middle line:84%
which is another GMO
ingredient, exactly.

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:12.839 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: OK, aspartame,
stir it up.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: OK, so for people

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.643 align:middle line:84%
that don't know what
aspartame is, the FDA,

00:11:16.643 --> 00:11:20.147 align:middle line:84%
the most adverse effects
that have been reported

00:11:20.147 --> 00:11:21.982 align:middle line:84%
to the FDA have come
from aspartame,

00:11:21.982 --> 00:11:24.451 align:middle line:90%
over eighty adverse effects.

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:25.485 align:middle line:90%
You know what, Mike?

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:27.487 align:middle line:84%
Aspartame actually
converts [inaudible]

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:31.158 align:middle line:90%
in methanol inside your body.

00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:32.959 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely damaging.

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:38.832 align:middle line:84%
We see brain cancers cases go
sky high form people drinking

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:42.302 align:middle line:84%
aspartame and using artificial
sweeteners in their products.

00:11:42.302 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It's also
genetically engineered.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.172 align:middle line:90%
Don't- I mean, it's the result

00:11:45.172 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:84%
of genetically engineered
bacteria;

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.109 align:middle line:84%
so it's another GE
product, but look.

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:50.343 align:middle line:90%
I noticed it's not dissolving.

00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:52.879 align:middle line:90%
Obviously our ph is too high.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.981 align:middle line:84%
Let's lower the ph by
slamming this sucker

00:11:54.981 --> 00:11:57.017 align:middle line:90%
with some citric acid.

00:11:57.017 --> 00:11:58.985 align:middle line:84%
Citric acid is also
derived normally

00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:00.821 align:middle line:90%
from genetically modified corn.

00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
This is in most soft drinks; not
all, depending on the flavor,

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.725 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to
add some acid in here

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.728 align:middle line:90%
to help dissolve the aspartame.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Citric acid.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.799 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So that you can
have a diet sports drink,

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:16.736 align:middle line:84%
zero calories, super berry
blast, whatever name you want

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:19.840 align:middle line:84%
to give it; and it's starting
dissolving a little more.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's actually-let's beef up
the acid there, and if we want,

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:84%
we can even through some
phosphoric acid in there.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.715 align:middle line:84%
Look, our colors are
starting to match now.

00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:29.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: It is.

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:31.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It has altered
the color.

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:32.786 align:middle line:90%
Actually-

00:12:32.786 --> 00:12:34.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: You know,
the acid is actually used

00:12:34.688 --> 00:12:36.356 align:middle line:84%
as a preservative,
but it also-just

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:37.591 align:middle line:90%
as the phosphoric acid,

00:12:37.591 --> 00:12:39.893 align:middle line:84%
it's used as a taste
enhancer as well.

00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:41.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's right.

00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:42.662 align:middle line:84%
It gives it a tarty
[phonetic] kind of taste,

00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:44.798 align:middle line:84%
kind of similarities
a fruit taste,

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:84%
which is why they can name this
drinks things like-what was it?

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.736 align:middle line:84%
Mountain berry, mountain
berry blast,

00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:51.304 align:middle line:90%
but there's no berries in it.

00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:54.773 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's check the ph of this,
Ed, because I want you to talk

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:56.209 align:middle line:90%
about the ph in detail here.

00:12:56.209 --> 00:12:57.644 align:middle line:90%
It's very crucial.

00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:00.614 align:middle line:84%
All of these sodas, because
they have phosphoric acid,

00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:04.017 align:middle line:84%
they have a very acidic
chemistry; in other words,

00:13:04.017 --> 00:13:08.255 align:middle line:84%
a low ph. Anything beneath seven
point o is obviously acidic,

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:10.457 align:middle line:90%
and we got some ph strips here,

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:14.094 align:middle line:84%
and a little ph test
strips chart, so let's find

00:13:14.094 --> 00:13:16.630 align:middle line:84%
out what kind of ph we're
running right here right now

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.964 align:middle line:90%
with the citric acid.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well, we put a
lot of corn syrup in there,

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:22.769 align:middle line:84%
but we're looking at probably
around four point five to five

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:26.773 align:middle line:84%
and on average, Mike-we tested
carbonated beverages-we look

00:13:26.773 --> 00:13:29.175 align:middle line:90%
at usually them being right

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:32.746 align:middle line:84%
around the four ph. The
stomach acid, hydrochloric acid,

00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:36.082 align:middle line:84%
is about a two to three
ph, and what happens

00:13:36.082 --> 00:13:40.186 align:middle line:84%
when you put highly acidic
things inside your body is,

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:42.923 align:middle line:84%
it causes your body
fluids to become acidic,

00:13:42.923 --> 00:13:45.392 align:middle line:84%
and when your body
fluids become acidic,

00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:46.893 align:middle line:90%
that is the breathing ground

00:13:46.893 --> 00:13:49.496 align:middle line:84%
and the starting
point for all disease.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:51.531 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's right, alkaline
imbalance is very important

00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:54.868 align:middle line:84%
to preventing cancer, supporting
normal cellular function.

00:13:54.868 --> 00:13:57.003 align:middle line:84%
And if you're looking for the
scientific reason behind that,

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:58.238 align:middle line:90%
it's very simple.

00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
The right ph range is
necessary for the absorption

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.009 align:middle line:84%
and the assimilation
of every mineral,

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:04.377 align:middle line:90%
including trace minerals.

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:07.547 align:middle line:84%
So if you alter the ph, the
cells can't get the nutrients

00:14:07.547 --> 00:14:09.015 align:middle line:90%
that they need to be healthy,

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:11.251 align:middle line:84%
and that's when you
start developing disease.

00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:84%
But let's test the ph of this
Mountain Dew that I just opened.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Which by the
way has the highest amount

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.424 align:middle line:90%
of caffeine in it as well.

00:14:17.424 --> 00:14:19.225 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: OK, this
ph is off the chart

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.594 align:middle line:84%
because it's not even
turning any color.

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:24.064 align:middle line:84%
The chart only goes
down to four point five.

00:14:24.064 --> 00:14:27.968 align:middle line:84%
This looks like it's a
ph below four point five,

00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:29.769 align:middle line:90%
highly, highly acidic.

00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:31.137 align:middle line:84%
Looks like the most
acidic beverage

00:14:31.137 --> 00:14:32.539 align:middle line:90%
that we've tested so far.

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:34.407 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And whenever
you put those highly acidic

00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:35.875 align:middle line:90%
beverages in your stomach,

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.878 align:middle line:84%
it alters the normal
reaction of your stomach.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:42.282 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your stomach is
supposed to secrete acid

00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:44.918 align:middle line:90%
to help you break down foods.

00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:49.289 align:middle line:84%
Your stomach in your body
was never designed to have

00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:52.559 align:middle line:84%
or to be put phosphoric
acid in these compounds,

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:55.061 align:middle line:84%
these acidic compounds,
into your system.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:58.398 align:middle line:84%
So really, it freaks your body
out, it freaks your stomach out,

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.834 align:middle line:84%
and you know, you wonder why
so many people have heartburn

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:02.402 align:middle line:90%
and gered and stuff like that;

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:05.205 align:middle line:84%
it's because the stomach
can never balance itself

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:07.674 align:middle line:90%
out with the acids coming in.

00:15:07.674 --> 00:15:09.242 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know what to do.

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:10.377 align:middle line:90%
Do I produce enough acids?

00:15:10.377 --> 00:15:11.611 align:middle line:90%
Do I not produce not acids?

00:15:11.611 --> 00:15:13.113 align:middle line:84%
I already have acids
in the body,

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:14.047 align:middle line:90%
what's the need to produce them?

00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:15.181 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: And Ed-right.

00:15:15.181 --> 00:15:15.882 align:middle line:84%
What's the need to
produce its own acid, but,

00:15:15.882 --> 00:15:17.283 align:middle line:90%
Ed, I'm just thinking.

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:20.787 align:middle line:84%
We forgot something super
important, the energy.

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Where is the energy
in our energy drink?

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:27.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: The energy, Mike,
comes from caffeine usually,

00:15:27.027 --> 00:15:31.598 align:middle line:84%
and this right here is anhydrous
caffeine, USP, the same stuff

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:33.233 align:middle line:84%
that they use and
they add to it.

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:34.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Caffeine
powder purified.

00:15:34.868 --> 00:15:36.202 align:middle line:90%
Don't let [inaudible]

00:15:36.202 --> 00:15:39.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Because-yeah,
I need my mask.

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:41.408 align:middle line:84%
But basically what we're
going to do is we're going

00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:84%
to take a little bit
of this caffeine here

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.214 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
add it in there.

00:15:48.214 --> 00:15:50.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: There we go.

00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:53.253 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And people-I
mean, we're a society right now

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:54.487 align:middle line:90%
that is addicted to caffeine.

00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:56.556 align:middle line:84%
You know, Mike, we talk
about addictions as in drugs

00:15:56.556 --> 00:16:00.994 align:middle line:84%
and all the time, but
drinks, diet drinks,

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
energy drinks are
a bigger addictions

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.699 align:middle line:84%
which are causing bigger
problems than drugs.

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:07.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Than drugs right now.

00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:09.402 align:middle line:84%
And did you know there
are actually energy drinks

00:16:09.402 --> 00:16:10.737 align:middle line:90%
that are named out of drugs?

00:16:10.737 --> 00:16:11.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I didn't
know that.

00:16:11.838 --> 00:16:13.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: For example,
this one right here,

00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:15.375 align:middle line:90%
this is called cocaine.

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a-it's a soda.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.745 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's got phosphoric acid,

00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:21.381 align:middle line:84%
and all the usual
culprit ingredients

00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:25.085 align:middle line:84%
that you may suspect, but
seriously, it's called cocaine,

00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and this is not the
weirdest one that we found.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.222 align:middle line:90%
Should I show them the blood?

00:16:29.222 --> 00:16:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Show
them the blood.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:31.958 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's pretty crazy.

00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Here's -
this is a beverage

00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:36.029 align:middle line:84%
that is being sold
online, Amazon.com,

00:16:36.029 --> 00:16:37.697 align:middle line:84%
everywhere; kids
are buying this.

00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:41.301 align:middle line:84%
It's called Blood, and it's,
of course, Be positive,

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:84%
which I guess it's sort a law
of attraction rule, isn't it?

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:45.505 align:middle line:90%
Be positive.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.674 align:middle line:90%
This is a different be positive.

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I guess.

00:16:49.242 --> 00:16:52.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: This blood, it
says right on the package

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:56.683 align:middle line:84%
that similar nutritional
content to natural blood,

00:16:56.683 --> 00:17:01.287 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually sugar water
with red number forty coloring

00:17:01.287 --> 00:17:03.556 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about
on another episode.

00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:06.059 align:middle line:84%
Really, this is what
kids are buying today.

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:08.927 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it looks little
blood fingerprints on it.

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:12.799 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a crime scene
afterthought, I guess it's part

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:15.400 align:middle line:84%
of the whole vampire culture
that's really popular.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I guess so.

00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:17.704 align:middle line:84%
All the zombies and
the vampire shows

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.272 align:middle line:84%
that are gaining
popularity right now.

00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:22.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: But if you think about
it, Ed, if you drink this stuff

00:17:22.008 --> 00:17:23.842 align:middle line:84%
and you drink these
artificial foods

00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:25.544 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting these
chemicals in your body,

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:29.249 align:middle line:84%
you are kind of becoming
living dead.

00:17:29.249 --> 00:17:31.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That's
exactly what's happening.

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:32.719 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at
the clinical studies

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:34.554 align:middle line:84%
that have been done
in aspartame alone,

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:38.124 align:middle line:84%
it literally makes
you brain dead almost.

00:17:38.124 --> 00:17:39.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, yeah [inaudible]

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:40.493 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean,
think about it,

00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:44.197 align:middle line:84%
from not the hygienist, but
sitting there causing your brain

00:17:44.197 --> 00:17:46.432 align:middle line:90%
to not even function properly.

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:49.502 align:middle line:84%
And another thing we
need to talk about is,

00:17:49.502 --> 00:17:54.641 align:middle line:84%
all of these acids are contained
in aluminum cans, you know,

00:17:54.641 --> 00:17:57.243 align:middle line:84%
which means they eat away
and you have micro parts

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.978 align:middle line:90%
of aluminum also in there,

00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:03.983 align:middle line:84%
and heavy metals is another
big thing that is associated

00:18:03.983 --> 00:18:06.186 align:middle line:90%
with neurological problems.

00:18:06.186 --> 00:18:10.890 align:middle line:84%
When you add aspartame and
high fructuous corn syrup

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:15.361 align:middle line:84%
and aluminum particles in the
brain, again, like you said,

00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:18.498 align:middle line:84%
it's a conglomerate or
a mixture of ingredients

00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:23.169 align:middle line:84%
that can cause a lot more damage
than just having one ingredient.

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:25.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, that's absolutely
right, and, by the way,

00:18:25.071 --> 00:18:27.974 align:middle line:84%
later this year we are going
to test the aluminum level

00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:29.742 align:middle line:84%
in the soft drinks to
find out, you know.

00:18:29.742 --> 00:18:31.611 align:middle line:84%
Is it-is it ten parts
per million?

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:32.312 align:middle line:90%
Is it a hundred?

00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:33.012 align:middle line:90%
Is it one?

00:18:33.012 --> 00:18:34.147 align:middle line:90%
We don't know yet.

00:18:34.147 --> 00:18:35.715 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find out
to bring that to you

00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:38.251 align:middle line:84%
on a future episode
here on Gaiam TV.

00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:41.621 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime,
let's talk about acidity

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:45.258 align:middle line:84%
because right here we have
some simulated kidney stones.

00:18:45.258 --> 00:18:49.862 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are actually
calcium chunks

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:51.998 align:middle line:90%
that we feed to our chickens.

00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:54.033 align:middle line:84%
You know, we raise free
ranch chickens at home

00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:56.669 align:middle line:84%
and they need a lot of calcium
to lay their eggs, right?

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:58.571 align:middle line:84%
because they use
a lot of calcium;

00:18:58.571 --> 00:18:59.706 align:middle line:84%
they even eat their
own egg shelves

00:18:59.706 --> 00:19:01.207 align:middle line:90%
to get the calcium back in,

00:19:01.207 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
but this is simulating
kidney stones.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.012 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were to
actually pass some of this

00:19:06.012 --> 00:19:12.352 align:middle line:84%
on your-your body, that
would hurt like crazy.

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:14.354 align:middle line:84%
You'd be screaming
and you would think

00:19:14.354 --> 00:19:15.922 align:middle line:90%
that your parts are on fire.

00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:20.293 align:middle line:84%
Now, why-what's the
relationship with kidney stones

00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:23.663 align:middle line:84%
and the phosphoric acid
in all of these sodas?

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well, it's
not only kidney stones.

00:19:25.198 --> 00:19:26.966 align:middle line:84%
Basically what happens
in the body, Mike,

00:19:26.966 --> 00:19:32.272 align:middle line:84%
is these acids degenerate and
cause our natural minerals,

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:34.507 align:middle line:84%
calcium to be pulled
from the bone

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:37.977 align:middle line:84%
to buffer the synthetic
forms of minerals

00:19:37.977 --> 00:19:39.412 align:middle line:90%
that are inside the body.

00:19:39.412 --> 00:19:43.182 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is, it
forms uric acid, crystals,

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:47.086 align:middle line:84%
or calcium stones, calcium
oxalate, and people end

00:19:47.086 --> 00:19:50.156 align:middle line:84%
up with gallbladder stones;
most people don't even know

00:19:50.156 --> 00:19:53.593 align:middle line:84%
about liver stones, but there's
massive amounts of stones

00:19:53.593 --> 00:19:55.728 align:middle line:84%
in the liver, and then
also kidney stones,

00:19:55.728 --> 00:19:59.132 align:middle line:84%
and this comes from-it's
a tale tell sign

00:19:59.132 --> 00:20:03.069 align:middle line:84%
that you're eating too many
acid foods and not enough foods

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:06.172 align:middle line:84%
that create an alkaline
level within your intestine.

00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:09.976 align:middle line:84%
Alkaline foods would be
fruits and vegetables

00:20:09.976 --> 00:20:12.679 align:middle line:84%
and lemons actually, even
though they're acidic,

00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:14.981 align:middle line:90%
create alkaline inside the body;

00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:19.886 align:middle line:84%
and acid would be your cooked
meat, your processed foods,

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:24.157 align:middle line:84%
any type of chemicals,
acids, soft drinks, etcetera.

00:20:24.157 --> 00:20:26.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Even refined
sugars are very acidic.

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:29.796 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may notice, by the way,
there is currently an epidemic

00:20:29.796 --> 00:20:31.464 align:middle line:90%
of type two diabetes,

00:20:31.464 --> 00:20:34.767 align:middle line:84%
but especially among
the Latino populations,

00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:39.138 align:middle line:84%
and we're [inaudible] in taxes,
so we have a lot of interaction

00:20:39.138 --> 00:20:40.807 align:middle line:90%
with Latino populations.

00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I always see them drinking
sodas, constantly drinking soda,

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.214 align:middle line:84%
and then they have diabetes,
and then they have gallstones;

00:20:48.214 --> 00:20:50.917 align:middle line:84%
and what's really disturbing
about that is that doctors,

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:52.518 align:middle line:90%
instead of saying, hey,

00:20:52.518 --> 00:20:54.687 align:middle line:84%
maybe you should stop
drinking this soda,

00:20:54.687 --> 00:20:56.222 align:middle line:84%
maybe you should get
the phosphoric acid

00:20:56.222 --> 00:20:59.158 align:middle line:84%
out of your diet, what
they do is, they say, hey,

00:20:59.158 --> 00:21:01.661 align:middle line:84%
let's remove the
gallbladder, you know.

00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:02.962 align:middle line:90%
Let's get it out.

00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Really they're not
addressing the root cause

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.933 align:middle line:84%
of the problem because they're
not trained , and exactly,

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:08.768 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen if
they remove your gallbladder?

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:11.337 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not going to
be able to secrete the bile,

00:21:11.337 --> 00:21:12.405 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to be able to break

00:21:12.405 --> 00:21:15.274 align:middle line:84%
down your-your liver
actually takes over-

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: [inaudible]

00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And has
to produce bile then,

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.513 align:middle line:84%
and then you're just going
to, you know, be going back

00:21:20.513 --> 00:21:22.815 align:middle line:84%
to the doctor, and getting
more pharmaceuticals

00:21:22.815 --> 00:21:23.583 align:middle line:90%
and more phosphoric acid.

00:21:23.583 --> 00:21:24.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's the plan.

00:21:24.417 --> 00:21:25.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: It is the plan.

00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:26.252 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's it, man.

00:21:26.252 --> 00:21:27.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: But what
about-look, I mean,

00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:31.424 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing is we're giving
food stamps out to people too,

00:21:31.424 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:84%
which is part of the problem
because they're only allowed

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.929 align:middle line:84%
to buy foods like
this with food stamps.

00:21:36.929 --> 00:21:38.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It's crazy.

00:21:38.064 --> 00:21:40.333 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, all of these are
eligible to be purchased

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:42.135 align:middle line:84%
on the federal-the
assistance program.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: But why can't
you buy organic foods?

00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:46.839 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they go to your local
market and use your food stamps?

00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:49.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Exactly, exactly,
there's something terribly wrong

00:21:49.342 --> 00:21:52.578 align:middle line:84%
with the policies, and
even corn syrup and many

00:21:52.578 --> 00:21:54.514 align:middle line:84%
of the ingredients that
are derived from corn,

00:21:54.514 --> 00:21:57.383 align:middle line:84%
that we are using right here,
such as citric acid-well,

00:21:57.383 --> 00:22:00.219 align:middle line:84%
corn is subsidized,
sugar is subsidized

00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:01.788 align:middle line:84%
by the government,
GMOs are subsidized.

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:03.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly, exactly.

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So we have policies
at the national level

00:22:05.391 --> 00:22:07.293 align:middle line:84%
that are encouraging
the population

00:22:07.293 --> 00:22:09.996 align:middle line:84%
to consume many beverages
and foods

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:13.199 align:middle line:84%
that are giving them problem
chronic degenerative conditions

00:22:13.199 --> 00:22:15.134 align:middle line:90%
that raise the healthcare cost,

00:22:15.134 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
which the employers are
then required to cover,

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.941 align:middle line:84%
so employers slash jobs and cut
hours putting people out of work

00:22:21.941 --> 00:22:24.877 align:middle line:84%
where they go out on the
streets drinking more soda.

00:22:24.877 --> 00:22:26.813 align:middle line:84%
What's wrong with
this picture folks?

00:22:26.813 --> 00:22:30.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And you know that
in schools across the nation

00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:32.785 align:middle line:84%
that they have vending
machines and there's no water

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:34.754 align:middle line:84%
in the vending machines
and the thing

00:22:34.754 --> 00:22:37.723 align:middle line:84%
that children can
buy are soft drinks.

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:40.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, or sometimes
juices that are sometimes are

00:22:40.927 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
as little as five percent
juice that can claim as juice,

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.131 align:middle line:84%
even though it's
only five percent;

00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:48.835 align:middle line:84%
it's ninety five percent
citric acid, food coloring

00:22:48.835 --> 00:22:50.336 align:middle line:90%
and corn syrup usually.

00:22:50.336 --> 00:22:52.638 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's a low calorie
drink, it's aspartame.

00:22:52.638 --> 00:22:53.773 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Mike: And check this out.

00:22:53.773 --> 00:22:55.374 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking
about toxic beverages.

00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:56.742 align:middle line:90%
I mean, water.

00:22:56.742 --> 00:23:00.112 align:middle line:84%
Do you know Nestle owns pretty
much the whole bottled water

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:01.581 align:middle line:90%
system in the United States?

00:23:01.581 --> 00:23:03.349 align:middle line:84%
They own Osargo [phonetic] they
own Arrow Wood [phonetic] they

00:23:03.349 --> 00:23:05.284 align:middle line:84%
own Polo Springs
[phonetic] up North,

00:23:05.284 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
they own Sephra [phonetic]
Hills down in the Florida area,

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.691 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did you know that water
per gallon right now is more

00:23:11.691 --> 00:23:12.992 align:middle line:90%
expensive than gasoline?

00:23:12.992 --> 00:23:14.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You know, the
corporate ownership

00:23:14.527 --> 00:23:17.396 align:middle line:84%
of water-we should probably
do a whole show in the future,

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:21.601 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very disturbing human
rights issue in my opinion.

00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody has
access or should have access

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:28.508 align:middle line:84%
or basic human right access
to water and to real food.

00:23:28.508 --> 00:23:29.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely.

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:30.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Which includes
unprocessed foods.

00:23:30.877 --> 00:23:32.912 align:middle line:84%
You know, the war on
raw milk that happened

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:35.515 align:middle line:84%
in the United States is
a violation of farms.

00:23:35.515 --> 00:23:37.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Which is another
toxic beverage, by the way;

00:23:37.383 --> 00:23:39.151 align:middle line:84%
it's pasteurized milk,
which we should talk about.

00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:40.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Because it's altered
with the pasteurization

00:23:40.887 --> 00:23:41.888 align:middle line:90%
and the homogenization.

00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:43.523 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about later, but Ed,

00:23:43.523 --> 00:23:45.391 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to freak
anybody out.

00:23:45.391 --> 00:23:47.793 align:middle line:84%
Let's get them some solutions
because I'm trying to end

00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:49.295 align:middle line:90%
with some solutions for you.

00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:53.166 align:middle line:84%
What can people do to protect
themselves from everything

00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:55.501 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked about
being the side effects

00:23:55.501 --> 00:23:58.137 align:middle line:84%
of consuming this,
phosphoric acid,

00:23:58.137 --> 00:24:00.873 align:middle line:84%
which is intentionally
added to all these drinks.

00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:02.175 align:middle line:90%
What can they do?

00:24:02.175 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: The number one
thing people can do, Mike,

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.846 align:middle line:90%
is to drink more water.

00:24:06.846 --> 00:24:09.615 align:middle line:84%
What I recommend is they
drink a super water.

00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:10.983 align:middle line:84%
And how do you make
a super water?

00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:11.918 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy.

00:24:11.918 --> 00:24:13.319 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
distilled water.

00:24:13.319 --> 00:24:14.754 align:middle line:84%
You know, distilled water
is going to be the best

00:24:14.754 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
because you're not going to have
the impurities, the fluoride,

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.792 align:middle line:84%
the chlorine, and all that stuff
that is found in tab water,

00:24:19.792 --> 00:24:22.228 align:middle line:84%
so I always recommend
filtered water.

00:24:22.228 --> 00:24:25.264 align:middle line:84%
But then, what I'd like to do
is add some organic apple cider

00:24:25.264 --> 00:24:26.899 align:middle line:90%
vinegar to the water.

00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:29.302 align:middle line:90%
This is a great additive.

00:24:29.302 --> 00:24:30.536 align:middle line:90%
It's very inexpensive.

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:32.638 align:middle line:84%
Mike, this whole thing
right here maybe cost

00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:34.240 align:middle line:90%
under three or four dollars.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And you only
add like a [inaudible]

00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:39.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Add a couple
capfuls to your water to taste,

00:24:39.078 --> 00:24:42.548 align:middle line:84%
and this is going to provide
all the natural live minerals,

00:24:42.548 --> 00:24:46.886 align:middle line:84%
the live enzymes, everything
that you need inside your body.

00:24:46.886 --> 00:24:49.589 align:middle line:84%
You know, athletes
now, they come to me,

00:24:49.589 --> 00:24:53.626 align:middle line:84%
I use-make this drink and
it's a hydrating drink.

00:24:53.626 --> 00:24:56.662 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have them use a little
[inaudible] and crystal salt

00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:59.732 align:middle line:84%
in there too, which has eighty
four minerals; it's a good salt.

00:24:59.732 --> 00:25:02.802 align:middle line:84%
See, there's always a bad thing,
and there's a good replacement.

00:25:02.802 --> 00:25:04.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: But just

00:25:04.136 --> 00:25:05.972 align:middle line:84%
to answer-maybe a skeptic is
watching this and say, well,

00:25:05.972 --> 00:25:09.408 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, vinegar is acidic
itself, but what you're talking

00:25:09.408 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:84%
about is because
of the interaction

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.947 align:middle line:84%
with human physiology,
the effect of this vinegar

00:25:14.947 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:84%
with digestion creates a more
alkaline effect throughout

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.552 align:middle line:90%
the body.

00:25:19.552 --> 00:25:21.354 align:middle line:84%
In not as simple as testing
the ph before it goes in.

00:25:21.354 --> 00:25:22.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: No,
but I do recommend

00:25:22.722 --> 00:25:24.857 align:middle line:84%
that people do use
ph strip testers

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:28.327 align:middle line:84%
and they test their saliva and
their urine on a daily basis

00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and if you're below five, then
you need to start thinking

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.499 align:middle line:90%
about alkalizing your body.

00:25:33.499 --> 00:25:34.867 align:middle line:90%
And we've done tests, Mike,

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:37.703 align:middle line:84%
within a few hours
actually-within twelve hours

00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:39.138 align:middle line:84%
especially, you can
notice a difference

00:25:39.138 --> 00:25:41.307 align:middle line:84%
by drinking apple cider
vinegar and water.

00:25:41.307 --> 00:25:42.708 align:middle line:90%
That's my number one solution.

00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Of course, number two would be
to eliminate the soft drinks,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.585 align:middle line:84%
you know, and replace them with
good cold press-get a juicer,

00:25:52.585 --> 00:25:58.624 align:middle line:84%
start juicing fresh local
seasonal fruits in your area.

00:25:58.624 --> 00:26:02.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: An look, even for-maybe
your family is used to drinking

00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:04.964 align:middle line:84%
out of the can, and
that's a habit for them,

00:26:04.964 --> 00:26:07.166 align:middle line:84%
and they like the
fizz, the carbonation.

00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:08.634 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing really
that harmful

00:26:08.634 --> 00:26:10.202 align:middle line:90%
about carbonation itself;

00:26:10.202 --> 00:26:12.605 align:middle line:84%
it's slightly acidic,
but not a big deal.

00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:15.908 align:middle line:84%
So what you can do is you
can buy carbonated waters

00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:20.046 align:middle line:84%
that just have an essence of a
flavor, like orange or lemon;

00:26:20.046 --> 00:26:23.683 align:middle line:84%
there are different flavors out
there, and they look and feel

00:26:23.683 --> 00:26:25.951 align:middle line:84%
and almost taste
similar to sodas,

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:27.420 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have
the caffeine,

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.288 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the
phosphoric acid,

00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:30.956 align:middle line:90%
they don't have the citric acid,

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:32.491 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the
artificial colors,

00:26:32.491 --> 00:26:34.427 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
the corn syrup

00:26:34.427 --> 00:26:35.928 align:middle line:84%
and the calories
that come with it.

00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:38.597 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great transitional
drink on your way to juicing.

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:41.701 align:middle line:84%
Like you, Ed, I would rather
people do their own fresh juice

00:26:41.701 --> 00:26:46.539 align:middle line:84%
every day; but from a practical
perspective, a lot of people are

00:26:46.539 --> 00:26:49.241 align:middle line:84%
in a hurry, they don't want
to do the whole juicing thing,

00:26:49.241 --> 00:26:52.344 align:middle line:84%
you know, two hours with a
normal press or something;

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:53.879 align:middle line:90%
they want to do something fast.

00:26:53.879 --> 00:26:55.581 align:middle line:84%
That's a safer way
for them to go.

00:26:55.581 --> 00:26:57.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Water, apple
cider vinegar, I mean,

00:26:57.383 --> 00:26:59.151 align:middle line:84%
or to do something like
what you're saying.

00:26:59.151 --> 00:27:03.089 align:middle line:84%
Another-another thing is, you
know, if you're a milk drinker,

00:27:03.089 --> 00:27:06.158 align:middle line:84%
we recommend that you
switch to a raw milk

00:27:06.158 --> 00:27:09.395 align:middle line:90%
or almond milk, hemp milk.

00:27:09.395 --> 00:27:11.597 align:middle line:90%
Stay away from soy milk.

00:27:11.597 --> 00:27:15.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Exactly, and on raw
milk; the reason raw-cow's milk,

00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:17.169 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to drink
that, raw milk is another way.

00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:18.471 align:middle line:90%
Some people are paying now

00:27:18.471 --> 00:27:20.106 align:middle line:84%
for raw human breast
milk, believe or not.

00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:22.608 align:middle line:84%
It's another story,
but raw cow's milk,

00:27:22.608 --> 00:27:23.943 align:middle line:84%
the reason it's more
nutritious is

00:27:23.943 --> 00:27:25.911 align:middle line:90%
because it has bacteria in it.

00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:27.813 align:middle line:84%
We want defensive
probiotics [phonetic]

00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:30.549 align:middle line:84%
and the lactase enzymes
that help

00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:33.352 align:middle line:84%
to digest the lactose
remains intact.

00:27:33.352 --> 00:27:37.323 align:middle line:84%
Heat, pasteurization
destroys the enzymes causing

00:27:37.323 --> 00:27:38.591 align:middle line:90%
digestive problems.

00:27:38.591 --> 00:27:40.459 align:middle line:84%
You know, you wonder why
people are allergic to people,

00:27:40.459 --> 00:27:43.596 align:middle line:84%
why they get acne and
constipation and sinus problems.

00:27:43.596 --> 00:27:44.864 align:middle line:90%
Because they can't digest it

00:27:44.864 --> 00:27:47.533 align:middle line:84%
because the pasteurization
has destroyed the enzymes

00:27:47.533 --> 00:27:49.668 align:middle line:84%
that your body needs to
digest that beverage.

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:50.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Right.

00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:52.705 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest thing that
I see all the time, Mike,

00:27:52.705 --> 00:27:55.875 align:middle line:84%
and the one thing that I'd
say is in the top five list

00:27:55.875 --> 00:27:59.478 align:middle line:84%
of the toxic things in
your life is diet drinks.

00:27:59.478 --> 00:28:03.416 align:middle line:84%
You have to get rid
of those diet drinks.

00:28:03.416 --> 00:28:06.819 align:middle line:84%
You know, people
drink ten to twelve

00:28:06.819 --> 00:28:10.556 align:middle line:84%
of these things every single
day, and it just amazes me.

00:28:10.556 --> 00:28:13.759 align:middle line:84%
You're setting yourself bit
time for failure and disease

00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:14.794 align:middle line:90%
if you have diet drinks.

00:28:14.794 --> 00:28:16.362 align:middle line:84%
You have to get those
off right away.

00:28:16.362 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Let me just read
you the ingredients on this.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.331 align:middle line:90%
It's really short.

00:28:19.331 --> 00:28:22.435 align:middle line:84%
You got carbonated
water, tab water,

00:28:22.435 --> 00:28:24.003 align:middle line:90%
caramel color, which is another-

00:28:24.003 --> 00:28:26.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Caramel color
is a carcinogenic actually.

00:28:26.172 --> 00:28:28.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Aspartame is the
third ingredient on this can,

00:28:28.774 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:84%
phosphoric acid, natural
and artificial flavors,

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:36.215 align:middle line:84%
sodium benzoate, toxic
preservative, and then caffeine.

00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:39.585 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you think of
a worst chemical cocktail

00:28:39.585 --> 00:28:42.421 align:middle line:84%
than what I'm holding in my
hand right now, diet Dr. Pepper.

00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:44.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: No, and that's
why it's at the top of the list.

00:28:44.657 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of a more
toxic-and you know, again,

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.263 align:middle line:84%
the more that you drink
these drinks and you get away

00:28:51.263 --> 00:28:52.998 align:middle line:84%
from natural water
and everything,

00:28:52.998 --> 00:28:55.768 align:middle line:84%
you're still having an
effect on the environment.

00:28:55.768 --> 00:28:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Mike, a lot of things
come in plastic bottles,

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.106 align:middle line:84%
and then you have BPA,
and you have toxic

00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:04.410 align:middle line:84%
or plasticides [phonetic]
and they mimic estrogen.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.212 align:middle line:90%
And we have a major issue

00:29:06.212 --> 00:29:08.981 align:middle line:84%
with estrogen dominance
right now, and the pollution.

00:29:08.981 --> 00:29:11.784 align:middle line:84%
Do you know there's
plastic dumps

00:29:11.784 --> 00:29:16.188 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean twice the size of
Texas right now floating around?

00:29:16.188 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, it's-it's
really incredible.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.759 align:middle line:84%
If you're buying these products,
you're supporting an industry

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:22.261 align:middle line:84%
that I believe, and I
think you would agree,

00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:24.864 align:middle line:84%
is destroying our health
and destroying our planet.

00:29:24.864 --> 00:29:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So, bottom line is
avoid these beverages,

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.270 align:middle line:84%
drink healthy beverages, and
especially teach your kids

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.838 align:middle line:84%
to be able to tell
the difference.

00:29:32.838 --> 00:29:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr Group: Teach
your kids how to say no

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.975 align:middle line:84%
when they're offered
a beverage at school

00:29:35.975 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:90%
or somewhere else, tell them no.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.645 align:middle line:84%
Tell them they can have
a natural replacement

00:29:39.645 --> 00:29:40.613 align:middle line:90%
when they get home.

00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So, thanks
for watching.
