to Secrets

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.468 align:middle line:90%
to Health with Mike and Ed.

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm Mike Adams with
Natural News.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Edward Group:
And I'm Dr. Ed Group

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:38.906 align:middle line:90%
with Global Healing Center.

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:41.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And today's
episode on Gaiam TV is

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:44.077 align:middle line:90%
about toxic EMF's exposed.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.145 align:middle line:90%
And what are EMF's?

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, electromagnetic pollution,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.817 align:middle line:84%
sometimes called
electropollution or electrosmog.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:53.086 align:middle line:84%
Ed, give us a little overview
of what we're going to go into.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Or
electromagnetic frequency.

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:58.091 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically Mike, this is
an unknown killer that's been

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.626 align:middle line:90%
going on for a long time.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:04.765 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has to do with
the unseen magnetic electrical

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:08.135 align:middle line:84%
charges that are radiating
all over the earth right now.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.603 align:middle line:90%
And believe it or not,

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.506 align:middle line:84%
most people don't know
how dangerous these things

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:90%
really are.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:84%
We're talking cell phones,
we're talking cell phone towers,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.547 align:middle line:84%
you know, geopathic stress
that comes from the earth.

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.917 align:middle line:84%
Normal things that you find
around your house, computers,

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:28.956 align:middle line:84%
everything else, all these
things create a disturbance

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:31.191 align:middle line:84%
within the body that
can be toxic,

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.994 align:middle line:84%
that can be cancer-causing,
that can affect our brainwaves,

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:37.164 align:middle line:84%
they can cause brain cancer,
they can cause immune--

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:40.634 align:middle line:84%
auto-immune disease, that
can cause thyroid damage,

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.869 align:middle line:90%
the list goes on and on and one.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And we're going
to demonstrate some

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:47.074 align:middle line:84%
of these right here
using EMF meters.

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:51.144 align:middle line:84%
Now I've got one meter that
goes up to 20 milligauss

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.914 align:middle line:84%
and Ed's got a tri-field
that goes up to 100.

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:55.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Harmful
electromagnetic frequencies are

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:90%
measured in milligauss.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
According to most
governments, the EPA and the UK,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.258 align:middle line:84%
anything under 2 milligauss
is considered safe,

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:06.693 align:middle line:90%
anything under 2 milligauss.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.662 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you fly on
an airplane actually,

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:11.665 align:middle line:84%
you're exposed to 50
milligauss the whole time you're

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:12.466 align:middle line:90%
on the airplane.

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:13.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Wow.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:15.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So that
means that anything

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:19.406 align:middle line:84%
over 2 milligauss can
cause cellular damage

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:22.442 align:middle line:84%
and it can actually alter the
water structure in your body

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:26.546 align:middle line:84%
because these things can
penetrate, Mike, 6 to 8 inches

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.483 align:middle line:84%
into the body, especially
with children depending

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:31.918 align:middle line:84%
on where it's located and
what your exposure point is.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.388 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, it's a field,
it's an electromagnetic field

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:37.324 align:middle line:84%
so your body doesn't
necessarily block it.

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.393 align:middle line:90%
You're not an EMF shield.

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:42.129 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of your
tissues can redirect it

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.398 align:middle line:84%
because they have
their own grounding

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:45.632 align:middle line:90%
or electromagnetic properties.

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.834 align:middle line:84%
But like you said, it
can penetrate your body.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:48.902 align:middle line:90%
But let's go in and show,

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.537 align:middle line:84%
let's demonstrate
some of these things.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:52.606 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with the
toaster because that's one

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:56.576 align:middle line:84%
of the lower radiations
or EMF sources.

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:59.146 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and by the way, I want
to clarify with the viewers,

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:03.283 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking about ionizing
radiation such as gamma waves

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:08.155 align:middle line:84%
that you might get from depleted
uranium or nuclear power plants.

00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:10.657 align:middle line:84%
So this is not the
Fukushima episode.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:17.164 align:middle line:84%
This is about electromagnetic
radiation or fields that are all

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:20.634 align:middle line:84%
over your house, just coming out
of the circuit box in your home,

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:23.503 align:middle line:84%
they exist in your car, if
you're using a computer,

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:25.472 align:middle line:84%
you're bathing your
body in these EMF's,

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:27.207 align:middle line:84%
if you're using a
cell phone and so on.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.375 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
talking about.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.744 align:middle line:84%
It's not ionizing
radiation like you might get

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:35.281 align:middle line:84%
from a decaying element
of uranium or something.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Right,
and you know what,

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.719 align:middle line:84%
just to let everybody
know, we are exposed

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:46.059 align:middle line:84%
to 100 million times the
amount of electropollution

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.727 align:middle line:90%
than our grandparents were.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Wow.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So in that short
amount of time, just within 60

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:52.599 align:middle line:90%
to 80 years, we're exposed

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.336 align:middle line:84%
to 100 million times
more radiation.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:57.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And yeah,
think about it.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:01.007 align:middle line:84%
Before the era of electricity
people had virtually no exposure

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:04.478 align:middle line:84%
to EMFs and I think most people
were a lot healthier back then,

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:05.612 align:middle line:90%
but let's get right to it.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.214 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to
show you here first,

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:11.284 align:middle line:84%
I'm turning on this meter
and bring up the trifield.

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:12.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah,
this meter goes

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:14.254 align:middle line:90%
to 100 milligauss right here.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.655 align:middle line:90%
Mike's only goes to 20.

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:18.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So as I activate
this common household toaster,

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:21.293 align:middle line:84%
watch what happens
to these readings.

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:24.397 align:middle line:90%
Now we have-- right here.

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:25.098 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's on.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Okay.

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It depends
on the angle,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.068 align:middle line:90%
but let me hold everything up.

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:32.472 align:middle line:84%
You can see here
that we're up to red

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:33.807 align:middle line:84%
on this chart and
what about yours?

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:35.709 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And on this
it's off the charts actually.

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:38.645 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what the
rating is because it's past 100,

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.414 align:middle line:84%
but let's see because you know,
obviously when you're, you know,

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:42.549 align:middle line:90%
toasting things you're not going

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:44.651 align:middle line:84%
to be having the toaster
right next to your head.

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I'm toasting
my face right now.

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:48.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Right now
I'm coming-- let's see.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.055 align:middle line:90%
Put it right there.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: I got turned off.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.992 align:middle line:90%
It's starting to get crazy.

00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:53.593 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Okay, well anyway.

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
You might be exposed to up
to 100 to 200 milligauss

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.900 align:middle line:84%
up to three feet
away from a toaster.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.169 align:middle line:84%
Let's get the toaster
out of here.

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.071 align:middle line:84%
Just remember that when you
eat-- toast bread in the morning

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:07.741 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, you're bathing
your food in the EMFs

00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:09.442 align:middle line:90%
but most importantly your body.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:12.746 align:middle line:84%
But now let's try
something really simple

00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:14.281 align:middle line:90%
like a pair of clippers.

00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:15.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.084 align:middle line:84%
That-- well normally
people use electric shavers.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, women and men
use electric shavers.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.757 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about this is,
I'll let Mike turn this on

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:24.858 align:middle line:90%
and we'll take a reading first.

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:25.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:25.926 align:middle line:90%
Hold them up.

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.494 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.063 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Off the charts.

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.499 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is just all the
way to the other side and look,

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.467 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to back
up a little bit.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:35.669 align:middle line:90%
Right now we're about--

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.539 align:middle line:84%
I'm about 2 feet away
and I'm showing a reading

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.944 align:middle line:90%
of 10 milligauss right there.

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:45.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Wow.

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:46.546 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Now, just
think of the damaging effects

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:49.182 align:middle line:84%
that would have if you're
putting it right on your skin

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.183 align:middle line:90%
or right on your face?

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:52.319 align:middle line:90%
As a matter of fact--

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Sorry to interrupt Ed,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.756 align:middle line:84%
but I noticed you're getting a
reading when this is off just

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.692 align:middle line:84%
from all the lights
in the studio.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:05:59.392 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: You know what?

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:00.794 align:middle line:90%
I am getting a reading.

00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:05.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You're getting like up
to 10 and this is showing 1.5

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:08.335 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting up to
10 with nothing on here.

00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:09.836 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: We're
actually bathing ourselves

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:11.838 align:middle line:84%
in electromagnetic
radiation right now

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to bring you this
shocking information.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.308 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's true.

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:17.244 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go to the next item

00:06:17.244 --> 00:06:20.747 align:middle line:84%
that we know is a
big score here.

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:22.649 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: We will teach
you how to detox yourself

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:90%
from this later on by the way.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.019 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Exactly, solutions
are coming so stay tuned.

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:29.189 align:middle line:84%
The can opener, where do you
think the can opener's going

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:31.457 align:middle line:90%
to fall on this spectrum?

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:32.158 align:middle line:90%
Take a guess>

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: You know,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.761 align:middle line:84%
I know because I've already
tested all of this stuff.

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:90%
The can opener is one

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:43.336 align:middle line:84%
of the strongest electromagnetic
producing household items behind

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:46.373 align:middle line:84%
the cordless phone, which
we don't have here today,

00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:51.177 align:middle line:84%
but actually the cordless
phone base emits super strong

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:55.115 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, up to 200
hertz, that are damaging

00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:56.582 align:middle line:90%
to anybody in the house.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:57.651 align:middle line:90%
If you have a cordless phone,

00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:59.519 align:middle line:84%
make sure you get rid
of it immediately.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:02.589 align:middle line:84%
But the bedroom by the way and
the kitchen are the main things

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.858 align:middle line:84%
that people want to look
out for because the bedroom

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:07.661 align:middle line:84%
and the kitchen are where
the most electronics are

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:08.795 align:middle line:90%
that are the most damaging.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:09.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Just a correction
though, you said,

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:11.598 align:middle line:90%
I think you meant megahertz.

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:12.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Megahertz, yes.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.401 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah, or gigahertz.

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:15.769 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly,
megahertz.

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I think some of the
newer phones are offering what,

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:90%
9.6 gigahertz, is that right?

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes, gigahertz.

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:21.775 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Somewhere
in that range.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:22.909 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Those are
radio frequency waves.

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:25.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:28.615 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. So I'll hold up the
can opener and let's hold

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:31.184 align:middle line:84%
up the meters and
do a test on this.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:31.885 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:32.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I'm ready.

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:33.086 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:34.487 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:42.395 align:middle line:84%
Watch. And we have pegged to the
red very far away, 3 feet away,

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.834 align:middle line:84%
4 feet away, 5 feet,
still over what--

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:51.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It's still
over 80, about 50 actually,

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:53.807 align:middle line:90%
there goes 50 right there.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So as you can see, you
know, when I turn it on its red,

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:59.946 align:middle line:84%
when I turn it off it goes--
it stops and goes down.

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:04.084 align:middle line:84%
That's because can openers
are very powerful motors

00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:84%
that are not shielded,
so there's no--

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.023 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they could
build a shield in here,

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:12.092 align:middle line:90%
like a copper mesh or something,

00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:15.528 align:middle line:84%
a faraday cage inside the can
opener that could shield you,

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:84%
but they don't because
that would add cost.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.501 align:middle line:84%
So inside this device, it's
actually not just a can opener,

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.737 align:middle line:90%
it's an EMF generator.

00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:26.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yes, and whenever
you have, like, EMF generation

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:30.944 align:middle line:84%
and radio hertz frequencies and
gigahertz all coming together,

00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:34.447 align:middle line:84%
all that is penetrating through
this system and the amount

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:37.217 align:middle line:84%
of cell phone towers out there
has just created a blanket

00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:38.518 align:middle line:84%
of this stuff all
around the air.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't only harm us either,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.054 align:middle line:84%
it harms the environment
as well.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:42.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, that's
exactly right,

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.256 align:middle line:90%
and you know what's interesting,

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:46.559 align:middle line:84%
if you've ever studied
earthquake theory you know how

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:51.264 align:middle line:84%
earthquake waves, they bounce
off of some geological features

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:54.401 align:middle line:84%
and when they collide, when
the waves collide you get these

00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:57.771 align:middle line:84%
incredible peaks that
can destroy buildings

00:08:57.771 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:84%
in isolation while all the
buildings around them are fine.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same thing happens
with EMF and radio waves.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.713 align:middle line:84%
So like you said Ed, you've got
all these radio waves coming

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
in at different frequencies,
different intensities of energy.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.421 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes at a microscopic
level, at the cellular level,

00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:18.324 align:middle line:84%
you can have DNA
destruction isolated

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:21.194 align:middle line:84%
in specific cells that's
not happening around it

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:25.231 align:middle line:84%
because of the collision, you
know, it's classic wave theory.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.034 align:middle line:84%
The cumulative effect of
the waves can do things

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:32.038 align:middle line:84%
that one wave or one field by
itself would not accomplish.

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:34.908 align:middle line:84%
That's basic physics and
it's happening in our bodies

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.709 align:middle line:84%
and around our bodies
every single day thanks

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.111 align:middle line:90%
to all of these electronics.

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.146 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah, you know,
Mossoro Moto, who did research

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:42.849 align:middle line:84%
on water and you know,
we really have to look

00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:44.884 align:middle line:84%
at how it affects the
water in our system

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:48.388 align:middle line:84%
because the water is the major
communicator and that's--

00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:49.556 align:middle line:90%
if the water is clean,

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:51.157 align:middle line:84%
everything else usually
is clean.

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:53.493 align:middle line:84%
And when he did research
and looked at water

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
under electromagnetic
or harmful radiation

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.532 align:middle line:90%
through electropollution,

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:02.802 align:middle line:84%
he found that the
water could not form

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:05.338 align:middle line:84%
into a six-sided
crystal and we need water

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:08.107 align:middle line:84%
in six-sided structure in order
for us to function properly.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So he actually said that
electromagnetic pollution,

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.414 align:middle line:84%
or electropollution, is
the most damaging thing

00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:15.748 align:middle line:90%
on the body system.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well it's why, and
we'll get to more demos here

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:84%
in a second folks, but it's why
when you go out into nature,

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.324 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're far from the
city, you're in a sleeping bag

00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:28.728 align:middle line:84%
under the stars in a rural park
somewhere, a national park,

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:32.565 align:middle line:84%
you feel calm, you
feel regenerated.

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:33.733 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:35.635 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the nature,
although that helps,

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.403 align:middle line:90%
it's also the absence

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:41.341 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
noise that's creating stress

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and inflammation and chaos
throughout your body.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.546 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: It really,
really causes stress.

00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:47.981 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's one of
the biggest things.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:51.251 align:middle line:84%
It causes anxiety, stress,
emotional disorders,

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:54.487 align:middle line:84%
causes brain fog and
it initiates, you know,

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.722 align:middle line:90%
pretty much every disease.

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:57.323 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
factors anyway.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Now a lot of people
induce electromagnetic field

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.429 align:middle line:84%
fluctuations in their
brains unknowingly

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:05.732 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing it
through a hair dryer.

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:06.766 align:middle line:90%
Let's test that next.

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:08.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: That's right.

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:10.103 align:middle line:84%
How many people and how long
does it take to dry hair?

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:12.639 align:middle line:90%
It takes a good amount of time.

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:18.945 align:middle line:90%
So let's turn that one.

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:20.346 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: We can't--
we can't hear.

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well I'll turn it
off and you can see that it pegs

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:25.718 align:middle line:84%
out at over 100, and when
you're putting this right

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:30.957 align:middle line:84%
up to the brain and right along
the hair, you're going to see,

00:11:30.957 --> 00:11:34.327 align:middle line:84%
and people are seeing actually,
increases in the cancer

00:11:34.327 --> 00:11:37.664 align:middle line:84%
of the bones, neuromas,
auditory cancer,

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
in the ear from people holding
their cell phone up there

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.203 align:middle line:84%
and just general
brain conditions

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.639 align:middle line:84%
that are being caused
by electropollution.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.841 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Right, and the thing
about this folks, I know a lot

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:53.379 align:middle line:84%
of you may drive electric
vehicles and, you know,

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.582 align:middle line:84%
from one angle it's great
for the environment.

00:11:55.582 --> 00:11:59.285 align:middle line:84%
I love the technology, but
it also means you're sitting

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:03.823 align:middle line:84%
in what is essentially a cage
with four powerful motors,

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:84%
one for each wheel
that's powering that car.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.363 align:middle line:84%
You're using electric motors
and batters instead of gasoline.

00:12:10.363 --> 00:12:12.398 align:middle line:84%
Well, you are putting
yourself in an EMF field

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:14.534 align:middle line:90%
that is many times stronger,

00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:17.003 align:middle line:84%
like orders of magnitude
stronger than what you would get

00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:19.739 align:middle line:84%
in an ordinary gasoline
powered vehicle.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So these are some of the
things you got to think

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.043 align:middle line:84%
about as we move
technology forward.

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:27.213 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people with solar
panels, they have inverters.

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:28.982 align:middle line:84%
The inverters emit
powerful EMF fields.

00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:30.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly, exactly.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.685 align:middle line:84%
And even people living
by power lines, I mean,

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:35.488 align:middle line:84%
if you live within 100 meters or
so of a power line you're going

00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:39.058 align:middle line:84%
to be chronically exposed
to over 2 milligauss

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:41.494 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic pollution.

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:45.298 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a girl that we
talked to that switched rooms,

00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:47.533 align:middle line:84%
she was 7 years old and her
parents, she wanted to move

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.002 align:middle line:90%
to another room in the house.

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:50.837 align:middle line:84%
Well the parents moved
her to another room

00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:53.406 align:middle line:84%
and there was electric
outlets and pushed her bed

00:12:53.406 --> 00:12:58.011 align:middle line:84%
up against the wall and in
her bed she had a mattress

00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.279 align:middle line:84%
and box spring, especially
the box spring,

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.447 align:middle line:90%
that had all the wires in it.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:02.882 align:middle line:84%
And that will act
as a conductor.

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:06.686 align:middle line:84%
It was picking up the electrical
pollution from the walls

00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:08.021 align:middle line:90%
and going right up through.

00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:12.258 align:middle line:84%
The girl had insomnia, she
had mood swings in school,

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:16.329 align:middle line:84%
she had unexpected anger,
she started having allergies,

00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:19.666 align:middle line:84%
all these conditions within a
week of switching to that room.

00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:22.902 align:middle line:84%
When the parents found out,
they moved the bed away one foot

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:26.806 align:middle line:84%
from the wall, got rid of
the box spring with all

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.275 align:middle line:84%
of the harmful, you know,
wires and everything in it,

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:31.377 align:middle line:84%
and then she started
feeling better.

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:32.779 align:middle line:90%
All of her symptoms went away.

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:36.616 align:middle line:84%
And women, if you're wearing
bras with wires in them,

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:38.551 align:middle line:90%
that is an antennae that can put

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:41.654 align:middle line:84%
that electromagnetic radiation
right into your breast tissue

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.623 align:middle line:84%
and breast tissue is
still on the rise,

00:13:43.623 --> 00:13:45.692 align:middle line:84%
and we're not even talking about
mammograms, we're not talking

00:13:45.692 --> 00:13:47.193 align:middle line:84%
about x-rays, we're
not talking about any

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:48.294 align:middle line:84%
of that stuff either
that's damaging.

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:49.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's a
really good point.

00:13:49.362 --> 00:13:52.298 align:middle line:84%
Every long wire or
cable or piece of metal

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:55.301 align:middle line:84%
through a process called
induction, you know,

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:57.937 align:middle line:84%
EMF fields can-- are
then magnified and turned

00:13:57.937 --> 00:14:00.339 align:middle line:90%
into voltage in those wires

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.141 align:middle line:84%
which I'm glad you
mentioned that.

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:03.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It's true
around all electronics.

00:14:03.543 --> 00:14:05.344 align:middle line:84%
But let's show people
something else.

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.246 align:middle line:84%
Right here I'm going
to show you,

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.982 align:middle line:84%
this is just a simple
battery charger changing a

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.084 align:middle line:90%
9-volt battery.

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:12.919 align:middle line:84%
It's off right now,
but we're going to turn

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:16.889 align:middle line:84%
on this power strip and show
you how much EMF is coming off

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:18.424 align:middle line:84%
of just a little
battery charger.

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:19.092 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:20.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Ready.

00:14:20.126 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: There we go.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Wow.

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:22.028 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Pegged.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.396 align:middle line:90%
More than 100, right?

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: More than 100.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And how
far away does it--

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:29.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well right now
I'm about a foot away and it's

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:32.572 align:middle line:84%
about 15, which is still
extremely toxic levels.

00:14:32.572 --> 00:14:34.507 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come back here
and then we're right back

00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:36.709 align:middle line:84%
at about the 10 just
because we're--

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.711 align:middle line:84%
with all the lighting
that we're exposed to.

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:39.846 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yup.

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:42.348 align:middle line:84%
So even something that
looks small and innocent

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:44.851 align:middle line:84%
like a little battery
charger, even something

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:47.754 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't make noise like the
can opener did or a hair dryer.

00:14:47.754 --> 00:14:49.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Or the power
pack, I mean the, you know,

00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:52.091 align:middle line:90%
the actual plug in unit itself.

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:53.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Exactly, any time
there's electricity flowing

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
through circuits, there is
some level of EMF generated.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.065 align:middle line:90%
That's laws of physics, right.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.067 align:middle line:90%
So be careful folks.

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:02.568 align:middle line:90%
Check out your situation.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:05.972 align:middle line:84%
You might have a power
strip by your floor,

00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:09.842 align:middle line:84%
you might have a computer
that's close to your head.

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:11.677 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will
show us a little bit,

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:14.881 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people have a blender
base that's actually fixated

00:15:14.881 --> 00:15:18.284 align:middle line:84%
near their pelvic region
because that's the height

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:19.685 align:middle line:90%
of the countertop.

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:23.856 align:middle line:84%
So they're blending and they're
bathing all their reproductive

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:28.261 align:middle line:84%
organs, their testes, their
ovaries, everything, you know,

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.263 align:middle line:84%
the eggs, everything
that's crucial

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:33.099 align:middle line:84%
to maintain genetic
integrity, they're bathing all

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.301 align:middle line:90%
of that in EMFs by blending.

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:37.069 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of people don't
think about that, Ed.

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:39.238 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: No they don't
and I mean, I see women walking

00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:41.207 align:middle line:84%
around all the time with
their cell phones stuck right

00:15:41.207 --> 00:15:42.542 align:middle line:90%
in their bra, Mike.

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:46.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Maybe you shouldn't
go to that club anymore, Ed.

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:50.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: But
look, I mean I've had--

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Sorry.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:54.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I've had people
with foot pain, believe it

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:58.124 align:middle line:84%
or not, plantar fascitis
that are--

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:00.893 align:middle line:84%
their foot is right next to
this underneath their desk.

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.228 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It makes total sense.

00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:04.697 align:middle line:84%
So I'll tell you what, let's
get some more props up here

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:06.866 align:middle line:84%
and show people more
demonstrations.

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:09.435 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we want to show
you some more common household

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.304 align:middle line:84%
appliances and the
EMFs that they produce.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:16.275 align:middle line:84%
So we have a $49 microwave
from Wal-Mart which pained me

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:18.911 align:middle line:84%
to purchase it because
I know where it's made,

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:21.814 align:middle line:84%
but nevertheless, we
had to show people this.

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.116 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a blender, we
also have a smart meter,

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:25.518 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about
that in a minute,

00:16:25.518 --> 00:16:29.755 align:middle line:84%
we have some compact florescent
lights and an electric blanket.

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:90%
So let's just go through these.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: All right.

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:32.925 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with the
microwave I guess.

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:33.993 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is something

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:36.195 align:middle line:84%
that everybody uses
multiple times a day

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.497 align:middle line:84%
and I think Mike would agree
with me that it's something

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:41.400 align:middle line:84%
that we want to make sure
that people stop using.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Okay, in the
back here it's pegging it.

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:44.537 align:middle line:90%
What do you get?

00:16:44.537 --> 00:16:45.972 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I've
got over 100, Mike,

00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:49.942 align:middle line:84%
and I know that these microwaves
go way over the 200 range.

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:52.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And this is, I think,
nailing my chest right now

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:53.613 align:middle line:90%
so I'm going to stop it.

00:16:53.613 --> 00:16:55.281 align:middle line:90%
Yup, the radiation stopped.

00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:56.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: It sure does.

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:57.116 align:middle line:90%
It goes back to zero.

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:59.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So microwave
manufacturers say

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:01.387 align:middle line:84%
that their products
are shielded.

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:04.357 align:middle line:84%
Well, they are shielded
for some frequencies.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:07.059 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to get the
microwaves coming out the front

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:08.794 align:middle line:90%
that are used to heat the food,

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:11.696 align:middle line:84%
but you're getting other
frequencies out the back,

00:17:11.696 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:84%
out the sides and even
some out the front as well.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.002 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really shielded in
the way that you might think.

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:18.971 align:middle line:90%
Microwaves emit a lot of EMF.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: They
do, and not only that

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:22.241 align:middle line:84%
but they microwave the
food and the beverages

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:23.643 align:middle line:90%
that people put in them.

00:17:23.643 --> 00:17:25.978 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's something I would
highly recommend everybody gets

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:27.346 align:middle line:90%
rid of.

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:30.483 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Russians in 1975
put out a worldwide warming

00:17:30.483 --> 00:17:32.852 align:middle line:84%
that ever country
should ban microwaves

00:17:32.852 --> 00:17:34.587 align:middle line:90%
and they actually banned them.

00:17:34.587 --> 00:17:35.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Wow.

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Well one thing that I
know about microwaves,

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.726 align:middle line:84%
I don't use them but-- well,
except on sets like this,

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.863 align:middle line:84%
but I know that if you take raw
broccoli and you microwave it,

00:17:43.863 --> 00:17:46.032 align:middle line:90%
it destroys up to 98 percent

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:48.768 align:middle line:84%
of the natural nutrition
of the broccoli.

00:17:48.768 --> 00:17:49.902 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.705 align:middle line:84%
The phytonutrients that
are preventing disease,

00:17:52.705 --> 00:17:53.906 align:middle line:90%
they're very fragile.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.208 align:middle line:84%
They're fragile molecules
that can be destroyed

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:90%
by microwaves very easily,

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.879 align:middle line:84%
so one more reason
not to use microwaves.

00:17:59.879 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.316 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Let's set
that to the side here.

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:04.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well Mike,
we might as well talk

00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:84%
about a blender right now, which
you were talking about before.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yes, the crotch
or radiator machine,

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:13.125 align:middle line:90%
also called a blender.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.461 align:middle line:84%
No seriously, you've
got reproductive organs

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:18.831 align:middle line:84%
in the pelvic region and if
you want to radiate them,

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:84%
this is the machine to do it,
but most of us want to protect

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.703 align:middle line:84%
or health, especially young
people that are trying

00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:26.339 align:middle line:84%
to have children, you
know, trying to reproduce,

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:29.508 align:middle line:84%
have healthy babies, you might
want to think twice about this.

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:33.279 align:middle line:84%
Now the problem though is
that blenders can be so useful

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:36.515 align:middle line:84%
in generating healthy
foods, smoothies, you know,

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:39.051 align:middle line:84%
I'm drinking a smoothie
here today on the set.

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:40.086 align:middle line:84%
You drink smoothies
all the time.

00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:41.454 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So we use blenders
all the time to stay healthy.

00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.691 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: But you might want to
keep your distance, you know,

00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:84%
blend and stay back
a little bit.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.962 align:middle line:84%
So let's check out
the power, ready?

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:50.629 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I'm ready.

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.732 align:middle line:90%
I'm just pulsing it now.

00:18:52.732 --> 00:18:53.599 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
show way out here.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:59.338 align:middle line:90%
I don't even start-- yup.

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:08.347 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go, it looks
like about two or more feet away

00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:13.519 align:middle line:84%
to significantly reduce your
exposure to blender motors.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I'd say
about three feet for sure.

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:16.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:17.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: It's something

00:19:17.623 --> 00:19:19.458 align:middle line:84%
that everybody should just
be aware of in their kitchen

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and just know that
these, you know,

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.829 align:middle line:84%
it's all about avoiding
these things, Mike, you know.

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:27.099 align:middle line:84%
It's about protecting your
family and if you know about it,

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:30.369 align:middle line:84%
you can still just it but
just try to avoid it or know

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:32.238 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
stand back from it.

00:19:32.238 --> 00:19:34.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Now part of the
formula for pollution is

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:36.909 align:middle line:84%
of course the duration
of exposure.

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:39.612 align:middle line:84%
It's the intensity of the
waves, but also the duration.

00:19:39.612 --> 00:19:41.147 align:middle line:84%
So the good news
with blenders is

00:19:41.147 --> 00:19:43.916 align:middle line:84%
that even though
they're very intense,

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:47.186 align:middle line:84%
your time of exposure is
normally quite limited.

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.922 align:middle line:84%
But hair dryers are the
other end of that spectrum,

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:52.525 align:middle line:84%
high intensity and long
duration typically.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:53.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:53.826 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:54.827 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:19:54.827 --> 00:19:56.028 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to the
electric blanket.

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.229 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Okay.

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.297 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And see how that
looks because people put

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.466 align:middle line:84%
that on their bodies
for long durations.

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:02.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Now this is
something that's very serious

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:05.404 align:middle line:90%
because people have--

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:09.475 align:middle line:84%
it has been shown that women
have had miscarriages, they've--

00:20:09.475 --> 00:20:12.578 align:middle line:84%
this-- electric blankets
have affected fetuses

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:16.182 align:middle line:84%
because women put these electric
blankets, believe it or not,

00:20:16.182 --> 00:20:18.217 align:middle line:84%
Mike, over their stomach
when they're pregnant,

00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:21.287 align:middle line:90%
and another thing is waterbeds.

00:20:21.287 --> 00:20:24.657 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there's as
many waterbeds around nowadays,

00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:27.893 align:middle line:84%
but waterbeds actually have
heating elements in them

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:30.296 align:middle line:84%
and if you're sleeping on a
waterbed with heating elements,

00:20:30.296 --> 00:20:32.598 align:middle line:84%
you're exposing yourself
all night long

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:35.201 align:middle line:84%
to harmful electromagnetic
frequencies.

00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:36.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:20:36.502 --> 00:20:37.536 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead and hold up the
meter and let me turn this

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:39.939 align:middle line:90%
on once we get the meters going.

00:20:39.939 --> 00:20:40.606 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:41.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Ready.

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:42.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:45.311 align:middle line:84%
We're on. I'm showing
about-- looks like 5 to 10.

00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:47.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I'm
showing about 50.

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:48.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Wow, you're
on the side.

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:51.117 align:middle line:84%
The position makes a lot of
difference depending on--

00:20:51.117 --> 00:20:52.785 align:middle line:90%
oh now I'm showing over 20.

00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:53.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:54.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Right here.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:55.988 align:middle line:84%
So you see, as you move
it around you're going

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:57.323 align:middle line:90%
to get different readings.

00:20:57.323 --> 00:20:59.024 align:middle line:84%
What does this mean in
terms of your health?

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:02.394 align:middle line:84%
It means that different organs
of your body can be impacted

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
with more intensity
than other organs

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.366 align:middle line:84%
or you might have
just patches of skin

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:08.801 align:middle line:84%
that are showing
the effects of it

00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:10.569 align:middle line:84%
where other patches
are perfectly normal.

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:12.938 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: We know
radiation causes cancer.

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:14.373 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's been proved.

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:16.976 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you had
melanoma or you have some sort

00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:19.578 align:middle line:84%
of a skin cancer or something
that's about to erupt

00:21:19.578 --> 00:21:21.847 align:middle line:84%
into a skin cancer and
then you're sitting there

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.649 align:middle line:84%
with a heating blanket
right over that skin.

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:84%
What do you think's
going to happen?

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.185 align:middle line:84%
It's going to alter
those cells and change

00:21:26.185 --> 00:21:28.287 align:middle line:90%
into a possible cancerous cell.

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:29.688 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:31.757 align:middle line:84%
Now I know some of you watching
may think well, wait a minute.

00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:34.493 align:middle line:84%
I don't think an electric
blanket is going to kill me

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:36.428 align:middle line:84%
and actually we're not
saying that either.

00:21:36.428 --> 00:21:39.865 align:middle line:84%
But when you put together
the cumulative burden,

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:41.066 align:middle line:90%
think about it.

00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:43.068 align:middle line:84%
You've got toxic pesticides
in the environment,

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:46.472 align:middle line:84%
you've got toxic medications,
you've got the toxic effects

00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:49.808 align:middle line:90%
of the adjuvants in vaccines

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that are affecting
the nervous system,

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:55.447 align:middle line:84%
you've got toxic food additives,
you know, household chemicals,

00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:57.816 align:middle line:84%
formaldehyde, glues
and carpeting,

00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:00.219 align:middle line:90%
all these things plus EMFs.

00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:04.323 align:middle line:84%
This is the point that we're
not living in an experiment

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:06.692 align:middle line:84%
where there's one
isolated variable.

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:11.363 align:middle line:84%
You have, like, 100 thousand
variables, 100 thousand burdens

00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:15.568 align:middle line:84%
and this might be the EMF straw
that breaks the camel's back

00:22:15.568 --> 00:22:18.037 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your own
health or immune function

00:22:18.037 --> 00:22:20.873 align:middle line:84%
or cognitive function
or all of these things.

00:22:20.873 --> 00:22:23.042 align:middle line:84%
That's the point, Ed,
is that there's so many

00:22:23.042 --> 00:22:24.843 align:middle line:90%
of these things and they add up.

00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:26.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Mike, let
me tell you something

00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:28.214 align:middle line:84%
that most people
don't know about,

00:22:28.214 --> 00:22:30.416 align:middle line:90%
and that's florescent lighting.

00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we are starting

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.287 align:middle line:84%
to see companies having
a decreased work load,

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:36.655 align:middle line:90%
migraine headaches.

00:22:36.655 --> 00:22:38.624 align:middle line:84%
We know for a fact now
that florescent lighting,

00:22:38.624 --> 00:22:40.426 align:middle line:90%
which most workers are

00:22:40.426 --> 00:22:42.795 align:middle line:84%
under florescent
lighting all day long,

00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and florescent lighting is
another big EMF producing factor

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.536 align:middle line:84%
that people are exposed to
all day at their businesses.

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:52.204 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And we're
exposed to it right now.

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:54.807 align:middle line:84%
Our set is being lit
with florescent lights.

00:22:54.807 --> 00:22:56.075 align:middle line:90%
We're exposed to it right now.

00:22:56.075 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, from
Ed and myself,

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.012 align:middle line:84%
this is not our normal
lifestyle, you know,

00:23:00.012 --> 00:23:02.248 align:middle line:84%
we're not indoor type of
people, we're out in nature,

00:23:02.248 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
we're doing smoothies a
lot but we're coming here

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.151 align:middle line:90%
to show you these things.

00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:08.921 align:middle line:84%
We're actually put our self in
harm's way in some, you know,

00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:10.956 align:middle line:84%
at some level in order
to show you these things

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:12.258 align:middle line:90%
so that you can avoid them.

00:23:12.258 --> 00:23:14.126 align:middle line:84%
But let's get right to
the florescent light.

00:23:14.126 --> 00:23:18.597 align:middle line:84%
As I turn this light on, watch
what happens to the meters.

00:23:20.099 --> 00:23:24.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: So my meter is
reading about 35 milligauss.

00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:26.238 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And do you
have it on magnetic?

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:27.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I do
have it on magnetic.

00:23:27.373 --> 00:23:28.207 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: All right.

00:23:28.207 --> 00:23:29.174 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Now if I switch it

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:32.077 align:middle line:84%
to electrical, it's
off the chart.

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:33.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: There you go.

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:35.414 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: See, if I
get close it goes over 100,

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:36.815 align:middle line:90%
which is electrical pollution.

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:39.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Now mine's not showing
anything on the florescent light

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:41.186 align:middle line:84%
because this has a
different sensitivity.

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:42.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That
is an EMF meter.

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:43.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yup.

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:45.057 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And so
I'm showing over 100,

00:23:45.057 --> 00:23:46.792 align:middle line:84%
and these lights are
extremely dangerous anyway

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:49.695 align:middle line:90%
because they contain mercury.

00:23:49.695 --> 00:23:51.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: So there you go,

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:53.766 align:middle line:84%
just two common compact
florescent lights.

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:56.502 align:middle line:84%
Now what's really interesting
is there's a national policy

00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:58.037 align:middle line:90%
for energy conservation

00:23:58.037 --> 00:24:00.539 align:middle line:84%
that says everybody should be
buying these lights instead

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:02.975 align:middle line:84%
of the old style
incandescent light bulbs.

00:24:02.975 --> 00:24:04.243 align:middle line:90%
Well guess what?

00:24:04.243 --> 00:24:09.548 align:middle line:84%
Both incandescent and compact
florescent produce EMFs

00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:13.152 align:middle line:84%
but only the compact florescents
contain mercury vapor so that

00:24:13.152 --> 00:24:16.255 align:middle line:84%
if you break them, you
are exposed to mercury,

00:24:16.255 --> 00:24:18.657 align:middle line:84%
probably the most
toxic heavy metal known

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:20.659 align:middle line:90%
in the entire table of elements.

00:24:20.659 --> 00:24:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So what are
some of the solutions

00:24:24.096 --> 00:24:25.564 align:middle line:90%
to this that you've found?

00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:28.067 align:middle line:84%
I mean obviously replacing
your lighting with LEDs.

00:24:28.067 --> 00:24:30.669 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's something
I recommend.

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:31.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Definitely.

00:24:31.737 --> 00:24:33.372 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- I've done
that in my offices

00:24:33.372 --> 00:24:36.375 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen a dramatic
improvement with workers from,

00:24:36.375 --> 00:24:39.778 align:middle line:84%
you know, we only had
florescent in there for a month

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:43.015 align:middle line:84%
when I moved my locations
because I had to order the LEDs

00:24:43.015 --> 00:24:46.985 align:middle line:84%
and everything and it's fairly
expensive, but after we put

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:84%
in LEDs in our office
I saw jut a major shift

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:56.795 align:middle line:84%
in not only complaints about
headaches and everything

00:24:56.795 --> 00:24:59.031 align:middle line:84%
but also just general
well-being.

00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:02.034 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Even behavioral shifts
I've seen in some studies.

00:25:02.034 --> 00:25:04.002 align:middle line:90%
But in terms of solutions,

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:07.139 align:middle line:84%
let's also make sure we cover
smart meters because a lot

00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:09.241 align:middle line:84%
of people are concerned
about smart meters.

00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:13.245 align:middle line:84%
It is true that they emit-- they
broadcast, they both receive

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:14.613 align:middle line:90%
and broadcast information.

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:17.483 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole point
of these systems is

00:25:17.483 --> 00:25:23.422 align:middle line:84%
to wirelessly broadcast your
electrical usage profile.

00:25:23.422 --> 00:25:25.224 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
profiling your house.

00:25:25.224 --> 00:25:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: They can actually
read exactly how much time you

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.263 align:middle line:84%
spend washing clothes, how
much time you spend working

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:32.464 align:middle line:90%
on the computer.

00:25:32.464 --> 00:25:33.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: On TV.

00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:35.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: They just watch
every single thing that you do

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:36.702 align:middle line:90%
through those smart meters.

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:38.237 align:middle line:84%
I mean these things
are scary, folks.

00:25:38.237 --> 00:25:41.073 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
these are on the outside

00:25:41.073 --> 00:25:45.611 align:middle line:84%
of usually somebody's bedroom
and people are complaining

00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:47.813 align:middle line:84%
about a host of symptoms
because of these.

00:25:47.813 --> 00:25:49.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Well the thing I don't

00:25:49.148 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:84%
like about them is they can
turn off your electricity--

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.951 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I know.

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:54.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Just during
peak hours or something,

00:25:54.086 --> 00:25:56.288 align:middle line:84%
they just turn it off
instead of asking people

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:84%
to voluntarily use
less electricity,

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.224 align:middle line:90%
they just turn it off.

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:00.592 align:middle line:84%
So now all of the sudden you
don't really have electrical

00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:03.929 align:middle line:84%
freedom anymore, you are at
the mercy of the power company

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:06.398 align:middle line:84%
which we've seen with Enron
in the past, we've seen a lot

00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:84%
of corruption, a
lot of criminality,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.404 align:middle line:84%
a lot of price fixing, you know,
people went to jail over that

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:15.474 align:middle line:84%
from controlling your power and
now they have this technology

00:26:15.474 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to put your power-- to
put a power control module

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.511 align:middle line:90%
on every home.

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:21.613 align:middle line:84%
We ought to do a show, Ed,
just about smart meters.

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:23.682 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And the thing is,
they didn't even ask you or come

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:27.286 align:middle line:84%
to you and say hey, can we
install this transmitter

00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:31.957 align:middle line:84%
like a mini cell phone tower
right on the side of your house.

00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:32.791 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: No.

00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:33.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: They're doing it.

00:26:33.992 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
No, they're forcing you
to do it, yeah, you know.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So but to get to
your point of solutions,

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:84%
the number one solution is
obviously to avoid exposure.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.502 align:middle line:84%
That can be done in
a couple of ways.

00:26:43.502 --> 00:26:46.505 align:middle line:84%
Number one, use fewer
electric devices.

00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:49.541 align:middle line:84%
For example, the can opener, you
could use a manual can opener.

00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not that difficult
to open a can, folks.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.979 align:middle line:84%
Do you really need a
electric can opener?

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:55.881 align:middle line:84%
You know, you could even
exercise your hands a little bit

00:26:55.881 --> 00:26:58.617 align:middle line:84%
by opening cans when you
need to, but you don't

00:26:58.617 --> 00:26:59.885 align:middle line:90%
like eating out of cans I know.

00:26:59.885 --> 00:27:00.752 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: No, I don't.

00:27:00.752 --> 00:27:02.688 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, we
didn't even talk

00:27:02.688 --> 00:27:04.089 align:middle line:90%
about really is cell phones.

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:06.291 align:middle line:84%
If I was to pick one
of the solutions,

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:11.196 align:middle line:84%
I would say do not hold a cell
phone up to your head at all

00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:13.866 align:middle line:84%
because you're constantly going
to be exposed to anywhere from 2

00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:19.071 align:middle line:84%
to 5 milligauss and you know
what, children as early as 7

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:21.206 align:middle line:84%
and 8 years old now
is the average

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:24.276 align:middle line:84%
when a child gets a
cell phone is at 7.

00:27:24.276 --> 00:27:24.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: I'm sorry.

00:27:24.843 --> 00:27:25.711 align:middle line:90%
I got a call.

00:27:25.711 --> 00:27:26.712 align:middle line:90%
Just one second.

00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:29.314 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm on the set.

00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:31.316 align:middle line:90%
No, but you're right.

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:32.551 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:34.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: No, but brain
cancer, a child skull,

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:37.289 align:middle line:84%
a cell phone will penetrate 6
to 8 inches into their skull,

00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:39.358 align:middle line:84%
only 2 to 3 inches
in an adult skull.

00:27:39.358 --> 00:27:43.529 align:middle line:84%
So a solution is, you know, you
might, we were looking online.

00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are a lot
of people out there

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.133 align:middle line:84%
that have radiation protectors,
cell phone protectors,

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:51.603 align:middle line:84%
there's even-- we found even
smart meter protectors online.

00:27:51.603 --> 00:27:53.872 align:middle line:84%
We weren't able to
verify any of that,

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:57.209 align:middle line:84%
but we still highly recommend
that you go online and look

00:27:57.209 --> 00:28:00.178 align:middle line:84%
around and see and see what you
can find to protect yourself

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:03.148 align:middle line:84%
from some of these
electromagnetic forces

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:04.449 align:middle line:90%
that are out there.

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:05.817 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I'm going to send
you a text and I want people

00:28:05.817 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:84%
to watch this burst
as we send the text.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Okay, well
I don't have my cell phone

00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:11.089 align:middle line:90%
with me, Mike.

00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:12.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: But I'm
broadcasting the text here

00:28:12.758 --> 00:28:15.360 align:middle line:90%
and as it sends, watch it spike.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.461 align:middle line:90%
There it goes.

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:19.164 align:middle line:84%
Broadcasting the text,
the meter is spiking

00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:20.999 align:middle line:90%
as the text gets broadcast.

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:22.234 align:middle line:90%
And if I were to make a call,

00:28:22.234 --> 00:28:26.838 align:middle line:84%
it would stay sustained
broadcast mode so.

00:28:26.838 --> 00:28:29.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Talking about
solutions, the main problem

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:31.243 align:middle line:90%
that happens in the brain

00:28:31.243 --> 00:28:35.013 align:middle line:84%
from electromagnetic pollution
is it shuts off the brain's

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:37.683 align:middle line:90%
ability to produce melatonin.

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:39.451 align:middle line:90%
Melatonin is the hormone

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:84%
that actually repairs
your brain cells.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.591 align:middle line:84%
So if you're having brain
fog, I mean if you're exposed

00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:48.393 align:middle line:84%
to electromagnetic
frequencies or radiation,

00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:51.663 align:middle line:84%
I mean honestly Mike, everybody
I think should be on melatonin.

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:52.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:53.532 align:middle line:90%
It's important to sleep to.

00:28:53.532 --> 00:28:54.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean
considering the fact

00:28:54.333 --> 00:28:56.068 align:middle line:90%
that they have cell phones.

00:28:56.068 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well let's talk
about avoidance a little more

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.038 align:middle line:84%
in the last few minutes
we have remaining here.

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:02.874 align:middle line:84%
In addition to using
non-electric devices,

00:29:02.874 --> 00:29:05.277 align:middle line:84%
you can also reduce
your time of exposure,

00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:06.812 align:middle line:84%
you can also increase
your distance

00:29:06.812 --> 00:29:09.047 align:middle line:90%
from these products and devices.

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:11.316 align:middle line:84%
Literally keep your
distance from them,

00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:14.319 align:middle line:84%
don't put devices hear
your head, hear your body,

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:18.624 align:middle line:84%
at your desk, in your bed, at
your work, office locations.

00:29:18.624 --> 00:29:20.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Bed
is very important.

00:29:20.025 --> 00:29:23.895 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who has a clock radio
next to their bed, move it away.

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:27.032 align:middle line:84%
Do not sleep with your
cell phone in the bed.

00:29:27.032 --> 00:29:30.669 align:middle line:84%
Do not sleep, I've had
people that have slept

00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:33.205 align:middle line:84%
with their laptop
plugged in in their bed.

00:29:33.205 --> 00:29:35.507 align:middle line:84%
They work on their laptop at
night and then go to sleep.

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:39.211 align:middle line:84%
So try to avoid all of that and
just turn off your power strips.

00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, shut everything
down is another solution.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: The less electricity
that's around you, the--

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:48.353 align:middle line:84%
really the calmer you're going
to be and the lower your level

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:55.093 align:middle line:84%
of being infected or altered
with electromagnetic radiation.

00:29:55.093 --> 00:29:56.928 align:middle line:84%
