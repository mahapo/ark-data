to Secrets

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:24.825 align:middle line:90%
to Health with Mike and Ed.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.694 align:middle line:90%
I'm Mike Adams of Natural News.

And I'm Ed Group

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:29.063 align:middle line:90%
with Global Healing Center.

00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: And today's topic is
toxins lurking in your home.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.002 align:middle line:90%
Ed, tell us about these toxins

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.137 align:middle line:84%
that are lurking
in people's homes.

00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:37.271 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: You know, Mike,

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:38.706 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really pay too
much attention to that,

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:41.609 align:middle line:84%
but after seeing a
massive amounts of patients

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:84%
in my practice, I realize that
I needed to go to their homes

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.983 align:middle line:84%
and check it out because
these individuals,

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:50.651 align:middle line:90%
what they're exposing themselves

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:56.357 align:middle line:84%
to on a daily basis gives me
all the information I need

00:00:56.357 --> 00:00:58.626 align:middle line:84%
as a physician to
determine what they need

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.094 align:middle line:90%
to do to change their life.

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:03.597 align:middle line:84%
Since I know that toxins coming
into the body are the main cause

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:06.667 align:middle line:84%
of disease, finally I
started going to their homes

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.002 align:middle line:90%
and evaluating things.

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And Mike, it's unbelievable
how many toxins are lurking

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.044 align:middle line:84%
in people's homes and why no
doctors are addressing this.

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:19.346 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really if
you're a physician

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:21.882 align:middle line:84%
and you're evaluating your
patient, you should be going

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:24.784 align:middle line:84%
to those homes of your
patient and looking

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.488 align:middle line:84%
to see what they're exposing
themselves to on a daily basis.

00:01:27.488 --> 00:01:28.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I totally
agree with you, Ed,

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.459 align:middle line:84%
because today most people
are actually living indoors,

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.827 align:middle line:90%
not outdoors.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:36.497 align:middle line:84%
So they're breathing more indoor
air in terms of total hours

00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:84%
of respiration than outdoor
air, and isn't it true, Ed,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
that indoor air is far more
contaminated than outdoor air

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.972 align:middle line:84%
in terms of total
chemical level?

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:45.639 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.041 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:48.709 align:middle line:84%
I have a little statistic here
I'd like to read for everybody

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.579 align:middle line:84%
and this is just-- was
shocking because I have kids

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.381 align:middle line:84%
and this was playing
and crawling

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:58.052 align:middle line:84%
on a typical floor exposes
babies to contaminants

00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:01.589 align:middle line:84%
such as mold, mildew
and dust mites.

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:06.227 align:middle line:84%
One day of exposure introduces
the equivalent of 4 cigarettes

00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:07.661 align:middle line:90%
into an infant's lungs.

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:08.861 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe that?

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Wow.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.798 align:middle line:84%
That is a pretty
shocking image, actually,

00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:12.733 align:middle line:90%
but it's also quite true.

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:15.603 align:middle line:84%
But here today we have
brought some examples

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:17.071 align:middle line:90%
to show people some products

00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:19.807 align:middle line:84%
that might typically
off-gas chemicals,

00:02:19.807 --> 00:02:23.711 align:middle line:84%
not just like pet dander and
mold and things like that.

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:26.947 align:middle line:84%
It's also products that
you bring into your home.

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:30.784 align:middle line:84%
For example, we have a
lubricant here, WD-40,

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:32.987 align:middle line:84%
we've got dryer sheets,
there's laundry detergent,

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:34.288 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of things.

00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:35.623 align:middle line:84%
We're going to discuss those
and then also we're going

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:90%
to give you solutions.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.226 align:middle line:84%
So we've got some really
great natural products

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:42.429 align:middle line:84%
that are natural replacements
for the toxic products

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.566 align:middle line:84%
so that you can actually
have, you know,

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.968 align:middle line:84%
you can do the cleaning you need
for your laundry in your home

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:51.005 align:middle line:84%
without putting poisons
into your home air.

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:52.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:54.942 align:middle line:84%
I mean when we were in houses,
we would go room to room

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:58.045 align:middle line:84%
and actually determine what
rooms are the most dangerous

00:02:58.045 --> 00:02:59.413 align:middle line:90%
and what people are exposed to.

00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:02.716 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the kitchen, you
know, you have Teflon pans

00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:04.652 align:middle line:90%
that can out-gas with cooking.

00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:06.954 align:middle line:84%
You have other types
of chemical cleaners

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:08.989 align:middle line:84%
in the kitchen that
can be toxic.

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.091 align:middle line:84%
You might have carpeting
in the kitchen,

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:12.926 align:middle line:90%
in the living room that's toxic.

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:16.297 align:middle line:84%
You know, now what happens
is they spray all these fire

00:03:16.297 --> 00:03:18.332 align:middle line:84%
retardants and all
these chemicals.

00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:21.869 align:middle line:90%
Anywhere from 50 to 250 types

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:25.706 align:middle line:84%
of toxic carcinogenic
chemicals can be sprayed

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:29.109 align:middle line:90%
on couches, carpets, drapes.

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.612 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things
end up out-gassing

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:35.014 align:middle line:84%
and putting these things into
the air and then we breathe them

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:39.853 align:middle line:84%
because you have very little
circulation in a home too, Mike.

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:41.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: This is made
even worse by the fact

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:44.758 align:middle line:84%
that today's homes are
trying to be more green

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:47.761 align:middle line:84%
and the way they achieve
this green rating is

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:50.397 align:middle line:90%
to become completely air-tight.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.499 align:middle line:90%
So they're not losing any air

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.269 align:middle line:84%
and they're just recirculating
the same air over and over again

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.738 align:middle line:84%
and they're calling that
green because it doesn't take

00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:00.407 align:middle line:84%
as much energy to cool
the home or heat the home.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.843 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, these so-called
green ratings can actually make

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:07.081 align:middle line:84%
your home air more toxic than an
older style home that's getting

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:08.982 align:middle line:84%
more fresh air blowing
through it.

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.651 align:middle line:84%
So that's a contradiction
that a lot

00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:12.119 align:middle line:84%
of people need to
be aware of, Ed.

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:13.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah.

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:15.555 align:middle line:84%
Also a lot of people spray
their home with pesticides

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.558 align:middle line:84%
and insecticides for
bugs and all that,

00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:21.095 align:middle line:84%
and that's another hidden
ingredient in the home.

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:22.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: They bomb their homes.

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:23.797 align:middle line:90%
They bomb their homes.

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:24.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I know.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:25.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Like a insecticide
bomb.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.835 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I
was growing up--

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:29.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Right.

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: A couple of times
I had relatives that, like,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.272 align:middle line:84%
we're going to set
off a bomb in here--

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And
you have to leave.

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:36.076 align:middle line:84%
They put a big thing over your
whole house and then they just,

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:38.746 align:middle line:84%
you know, I don't even know what
chemicals they use on there.

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:41.849 align:middle line:84%
But talking about bombs,
I mean, people ask me,

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.786 align:middle line:84%
what is the main thing
in the house that's going

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:48.122 align:middle line:90%
to be the most damaging to me

00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and I tell them it's
the air quality

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.227 align:middle line:84%
because people take
30,000 breaths a day

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:55.229 align:middle line:90%
and you need oxygen.

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.464 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a bunch
of chemicals in the house

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.266 align:middle line:84%
that you're breathing
in, you know,

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:04.538 align:middle line:84%
walk into any normal bathroom
and most women, the perfume,

00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:07.107 align:middle line:84%
the deodorant that's sprayed
in the bathrooms, I mean,

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:11.779 align:middle line:84%
the toxic shampoo, the toxic
condition, the toxic make up.

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.481 align:middle line:84%
I mean, inside homes
is literally

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:19.153 align:middle line:84%
in most homes a chemical
warehouse and people,

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:21.789 align:middle line:84%
the first thing I tell them
is clean their air quality

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:90%
in their house.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, and you mentioned
these bathroom style chemicals.

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:26.293 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:27.761 align:middle line:90%
I think the average American,

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:30.731 align:middle line:84%
before they even leave
their house that morning,

00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:35.536 align:middle line:84%
they expose themselves to over
300 different synthetic toxic

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.738 align:middle line:84%
chemicals from the
things you just mentioned,

00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:41.308 align:middle line:84%
the anti-bacterial soap,
the shampoo, the deodorants,

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:44.144 align:middle line:84%
the cosmetics, the
make-up, the hair spray,

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:46.146 align:middle line:84%
all of these personal
care products.

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:47.915 align:middle line:84%
You really have to
be extremely careful

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:49.683 align:middle line:90%
about what you're buying.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:53.053 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, under federal
law these companies are not

00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:56.323 align:middle line:84%
required to list the
actual chemical ingredients

00:05:56.323 --> 00:05:57.558 align:middle line:90%
that are in their products.

00:05:57.558 --> 00:06:00.527 align:middle line:84%
Many of them do voluntarily,
but there are not laws

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:01.895 align:middle line:90%
that require them to do so.

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:05.466 align:middle line:84%
So they could actually hide
chemicals, not tell you what's

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:07.167 align:middle line:84%
in it even though you're
putting it on your body.

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.435 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty shocking.

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah, so listen
to this statistic, Mike.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.408 align:middle line:84%
Every year indoor air pollution
is responsible for the death

00:06:14.408 --> 00:06:18.278 align:middle line:90%
of 1.6 million people.

00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:20.948 align:middle line:84%
That's one death
every 20 seconds.

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:22.649 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Is that a
global figure or is that?

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:23.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That's
a global figure.

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:24.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Okay.

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:25.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Due to pneumonia,

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.554 align:middle line:84%
chronic respiratory
disease and lung cancer.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:30.324 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's how many toxins
are lurking in the home.

00:06:30.324 --> 00:06:33.026 align:middle line:84%
And not only the home
either, the businesses too.

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean businesses are just
as toxic most of the time.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.131 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yes.

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Since we were
talking about air, I mean,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.336 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the solutions
for air that people can use

00:06:42.336 --> 00:06:45.205 align:middle line:84%
since that's one of
the biggest components

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:48.008 align:middle line:90%
of toxic build up in the house?

00:06:48.008 --> 00:06:49.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Well, we got a lot of
solutions for cleaning the air.

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:51.311 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the simplest
thing is

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:53.447 align:middle line:84%
to actually get more
house plants.

00:06:53.447 --> 00:06:56.216 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that plants
are natural living air

00:06:56.216 --> 00:06:57.818 align:middle line:90%
filtration devices.

00:06:57.818 --> 00:07:01.188 align:middle line:84%
They actually, they
respirate just like people

00:07:01.188 --> 00:07:03.223 align:middle line:84%
but a different chemical
exchange is happening

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:04.424 align:middle line:90%
with plants.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:07.194 align:middle line:84%
So they're taking in some
of these chemicals and,

00:07:07.194 --> 00:07:09.263 align:middle line:90%
like volatile organic compounds,

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:12.399 align:middle line:84%
and they're actually converting
them into harmless gases

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.668 align:middle line:84%
that are then released
through the plant's leaves.

00:07:14.668 --> 00:07:19.039 align:middle line:84%
So plants are natural
bioremediation systems

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.208 align:middle line:84%
for boosting indoor
air quality, Ed.

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I'm so glad
you mentioned that because

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.212 align:middle line:84%
that was one of the first things
I would tell people to do,

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:27.714 align:middle line:90%
is put live plants in your home.

00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:31.151 align:middle line:84%
And again, plants will
take in carbon dioxide,

00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:34.321 align:middle line:84%
which you release when
you breath, and for homes

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:36.256 align:middle line:84%
that have a lot of people
in them, a lot of kids,

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:38.959 align:middle line:84%
you can build up carbon
dioxide in the home.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:42.529 align:middle line:84%
And the plant thrives on that,
takes the carbon dioxide in

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:45.999 align:middle line:84%
and then releases oxygen
back out as a byproduct,

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:48.368 align:middle line:84%
and oxygen is a universal
cleanser,

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:51.171 align:middle line:84%
and who wouldn't want
more oxygen in their home?

00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:53.507 align:middle line:90%
So plants are incredible.

00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:55.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You know, on that
point, I have to add this Ed.

00:07:55.943 --> 00:07:58.178 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that in
an office environment,

00:07:58.178 --> 00:08:01.048 align:middle line:84%
you can actually have carbon
dioxide levels in the air

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:04.351 align:middle line:84%
that can reach up to
5,000 parts per million.

00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:05.953 align:middle line:90%
Now all of the alarm

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:09.156 align:middle line:84%
about global warming is
right now talking about CO2

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:12.526 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere at
400 parts per million.

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:15.762 align:middle line:84%
You can go 10 times that in an
indoor office is you don't have

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:18.599 align:middle line:84%
plants where you're just
breathing the same CO2

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:19.833 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.069 align:middle line:90%
It's not uncommon to have 3,000,

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:24.771 align:middle line:84%
4,000 parts per million
in a workplace.

00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:26.306 align:middle line:84%
So your point is
really important

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:27.608 align:middle line:90%
for people to understand.

00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:29.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah and I,
you know, I had to do a lot

00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:30.711 align:middle line:84%
of research, Mike,
and try to figure

00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:33.946 align:middle line:84%
out what is the best
air purification system

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:35.082 align:middle line:90%
for the home.

00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:36.383 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there's
a lot of standup units

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:39.051 align:middle line:84%
that people can put in,
individual room units

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.686 align:middle line:84%
and I know you're going
to show us one of those.

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:41.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:08:41.622 --> 00:08:42.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: What
I like though,

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:47.027 align:middle line:84%
is I like to address the main
HVAC system up in the attic.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:50.063 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this is
something that you could put,

00:08:50.063 --> 00:08:54.968 align:middle line:84%
install in the plume before
the air goes out to all

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:57.871 align:middle line:84%
of the individual
rooms in your home.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And this right here is called
the Remi [phonetic] unit.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.109 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there's
always new companies coming

00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:90%
up with high-technology.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.879 align:middle line:84%
This is what I use and
this is what I recommend

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:11.952 align:middle line:84%
because it produces ionized
hydroperoxides and super oxides

00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:14.321 align:middle line:84%
and it's amazing
because it actually,

00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:18.859 align:middle line:84%
it literally cleans all of
the vent systems in your home,

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:20.894 align:middle line:84%
and that's a place
where a lot of people,

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:24.765 align:middle line:84%
especially down south, have
problems with mold and mildew

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:28.135 align:middle line:84%
and dust particles that get
trapped up in there and some

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:34.341 align:middle line:84%
of the standup units, they're
not going to address, obviously,

00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:35.776 align:middle line:90%
what's up in the vent system.

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Exactly.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.079 align:middle line:84%
Are you sure you didn't steal
that fusion generator off

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.814 align:middle line:90%
of the back to the future--

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I know,
it's high-tech, huh.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: I've got a unit here
that's a pretty nice stand

00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:46.486 align:middle line:90%
up unit.

00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:49.122 align:middle line:90%
This one's called the Therapure.

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:53.293 align:middle line:84%
The thing I like about this unit
is it does have a UV function

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:57.898 align:middle line:84%
here that also helps eliminate
VOC's and plus the filter,

00:09:57.898 --> 00:10:01.601 align:middle line:84%
if you look on the back, the
filter is a cylindrical shape

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.071 align:middle line:84%
which gives it a lot
more surface area

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:05.972 align:middle line:90%
that a typically square filter.

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:07.741 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually
really effective

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:09.409 align:middle line:90%
in terms of a standup unit.

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I use this one right by my desk,
but I'm also installing one

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.282 align:middle line:84%
of these units that
you just showed us.

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:16.817 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah, I'm glad
you mentioned by your desk

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:84%
because those kind of units
you can take to your office,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's really important to
have clean air at your office,

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.993 align:middle line:84%
or you can put them in certain
rooms as well in your house.

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:29.196 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I actually have
some of those standup units

00:10:29.196 --> 00:10:31.598 align:middle line:84%
and I use the Remi
unit for the air.

00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:34.167 align:middle line:84%
But I know we were touching
on mold and we wanted

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:35.569 align:middle line:90%
to show some pictures of--

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:36.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh yeah, get ready.

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:37.904 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Mold
and let people know

00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:40.107 align:middle line:84%
that mold is a serious
condition.

00:10:40.107 --> 00:10:44.311 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one out of
probably 15 homes

00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:46.513 align:middle line:84%
in the southern states
has problems with mold

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:49.916 align:middle line:84%
and I tell you what, we've
had hurricanes down here,

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:52.586 align:middle line:84%
we're in Texas, and
there are companies

00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:57.324 align:middle line:84%
and businesses right now, like,
big buildings that have mold

00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:59.693 align:middle line:84%
in between the walls and
people are getting sick going

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:01.128 align:middle line:90%
to work all day.

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Black mold, I've heard
of some lawsuits about that,

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.266 align:middle line:84%
the FEMA trailers that
people were living in.

00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:09.836 align:middle line:84%
I think they were off-gassing
high amounts of formaldehyde,

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.738 align:middle line:84%
right, that was one of the
chemicals they were off-gassing.

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:14.674 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some of
the chemicals that you can get

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.843 align:middle line:84%
in your home, looking at
some of these products.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.346 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not picking on
these particular brands.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.114 align:middle line:84%
These are just to
represent categories,

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:24.084 align:middle line:84%
but take a standard
thing like WD-40.

00:11:24.084 --> 00:11:25.685 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people have WD-40.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.487 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's useful
for lots of things.

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:30.157 align:middle line:84%
You know, freeing stuck
bolts and nuts and things.

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:34.661 align:middle line:84%
But let's also face it, this has
a lot of toxic chemicals in it

00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:37.697 align:middle line:84%
that if you spray it in your
home, then that circulates

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.801 align:middle line:84%
in your home, you're eventually
going to breathe some amount

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.469 align:middle line:84%
of that and that's
not good for you.

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:43.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And how
many people do you know

00:11:43.737 --> 00:11:46.206 align:middle line:84%
that use WD-40 and
don't wear gloves.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.508 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've watched people,
even growing up my dad

00:11:48.508 --> 00:11:51.144 align:middle line:90%
and my uncle and everybody.

00:11:51.144 --> 00:11:53.547 align:middle line:84%
I mean, WD-40 was around
everywhere and it was just,

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:56.383 align:middle line:84%
like, a can here, a can
here and a can here.

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yeah.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And they
never wore gloves,

00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:00.887 align:middle line:84%
and that stuff sinks in and
you know, what we're talking

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:04.758 align:middle line:84%
about here is we're talking
about an accumulation of toxins.

00:12:04.758 --> 00:12:08.428 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you add
all these things together,

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:09.963 align:middle line:90%
the body becomes bombarded.

00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:12.365 align:middle line:84%
I mean let's say on a daily
basis you might be taking

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:15.435 align:middle line:84%
in 50,000 toxins from
the air in your home.

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:17.437 align:middle line:84%
You might be taking
in 10,000 toxins

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:18.839 align:middle line:90%
from the chemicals in your home.

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:22.709 align:middle line:84%
You might be taking in
10,000 toxins from the VOC's

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:25.912 align:middle line:84%
from the paint on the wall and
the out-gassings in the carpet.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.615 align:middle line:84%
You might be breathing dust
mites and stuff like that,

00:12:28.615 --> 00:12:30.217 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to talk
about a little bit later

00:12:30.217 --> 00:12:35.755 align:middle line:84%
and show you some shocking
pictures of dust mites and why,

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:39.259 align:middle line:84%
you know, 99 to 100 percent
of the allergies that happen,

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.228 align:middle line:84%
children's allergies
and adult allergies,

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:84%
it's almost always
some sort of a chemical

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.334 align:middle line:84%
or dust mite droppings
that are in the home

00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:48.535 align:middle line:90%
that they're exposed to.

00:12:48.535 --> 00:12:50.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You've also got
a problem with new homes.

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:53.673 align:middle line:84%
So new homes need
time to off-gas

00:12:53.673 --> 00:12:55.275 align:middle line:84%
because you've got all
these new materials.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:90%
So we brought examples of that.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.812 align:middle line:90%
Here's Rustoleum enamel.

00:12:58.812 --> 00:13:03.083 align:middle line:84%
We've got a household
paint here, a paint primer.

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:07.254 align:middle line:84%
There's glue in carpet and
formaldehyde in carpet.

00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:10.257 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things
off-gas so have you ever walked

00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:14.895 align:middle line:84%
into a new home and you
have that new home smell.

00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:18.265 align:middle line:84%
That's actually a combination
of literally thousands

00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:21.001 align:middle line:84%
of different chemicals that you
mentioned numbers like 10,000,

00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:84%
20,000, some people might think
that couldn't possibly be true.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:29.009 align:middle line:84%
I just saw a study recently that
found 24,000 different chemicals

00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:32.879 align:middle line:84%
at trace levels in
bottled water, 24,000.

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:34.881 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not a big
amount of each chemical.

00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:36.016 align:middle line:90%
It's very trace.

00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:37.984 align:middle line:84%
Probably we're talking
low parts per billion

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:84%
or even maybe just high
parts her trillion,

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
but it's 24,000 different
chemicals have been identified

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.092 align:middle line:90%
and isolated in bottled water.

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:47.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean,
the fact is we live

00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:49.963 align:middle line:90%
in a chemical world right now

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:51.431 align:middle line:84%
and it's the whole
reason why we're trying

00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:53.333 align:middle line:84%
to bring this information
to everybody

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.302 align:middle line:84%
because just eliminating
one chemical.

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Like let's say tomorrow
you go out

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.941 align:middle line:84%
and you buy an organic shampoo
and an organic condition.

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:03.243 align:middle line:84%
Well, you just eliminated
toxins from that.

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:06.212 align:middle line:84%
Then the next time you go
shopping, you buy organic soap

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:08.782 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have all those
perfumes and all those chemicals

00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:11.851 align:middle line:84%
and sodium laurel sulfate and
all the chemicals in your soap

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.219 align:middle line:84%
that you're putting
on your skin.

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.521 align:middle line:90%
Then the next time you go

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
out you buy a fluoride
filter shower filter

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.826 align:middle line:84%
so you're not getting all
the chemicals in the water.

00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:23.263 align:middle line:84%
It's about baby steps to start
taking one step at a time

00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:28.168 align:middle line:84%
and slowly eliminating chemicals
from your house and your--

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:31.871 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're using them for
in your house or on your skin

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:35.542 align:middle line:84%
or anything else, and
setting aside some time

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:39.379 align:middle line:84%
to slowly reduce the amount of
toxins that you're exposed to.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: That's great
advise, Ed,

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.749 align:middle line:84%
and it really makes sense
strategically to start

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:44.951 align:middle line:84%
with the areas where you
have the most exposure.

00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:48.355 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about laundry
products, Ed, for a second,

00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:52.092 align:middle line:84%
because laundry detergent
is typically inundated

00:14:52.092 --> 00:14:55.362 align:middle line:84%
with perfumes, and these
are all synthetic chemicals,

00:14:55.362 --> 00:14:57.998 align:middle line:84%
and we also have another
product here that we brought.

00:14:57.998 --> 00:15:02.702 align:middle line:84%
This is Gain, what is it,
softener, a fabric softener

00:15:02.702 --> 00:15:04.504 align:middle line:90%
that you put in a dryer.

00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:84%
This is-- there are
many brands of this.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.177 align:middle line:84%
This product is so
strong and it's based

00:15:11.177 --> 00:15:14.114 align:middle line:84%
on synthetic chemicals
that have toxicity.

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:17.384 align:middle line:84%
It's so strong that we
had actually originally--

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:20.186 align:middle line:84%
I can't even be near
the smell for one thing.

00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:20.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Right.

00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:22.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It's too strong.

00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:25.592 align:middle line:84%
We had wrapped it in three
layers of plastic bags

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:30.397 align:middle line:84%
and it still was inundating
us through the plastic bags.

00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:35.235 align:middle line:84%
I finally found this high-end
waterproof sealed container

00:15:35.235 --> 00:15:38.772 align:middle line:84%
to stop the Gain from
getting outside the container

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:42.008 align:middle line:84%
and polluting my car on the
way here to film this today.

00:15:42.008 --> 00:15:44.044 align:middle line:84%
Finally I was able to
trap it in this container.

00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:45.478 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing how strong this is.

00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:47.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: True story,
I had a patient one time

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.382 align:middle line:84%
that had rashes all
over their body.

00:15:49.382 --> 00:15:51.551 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't figure
out what it was.

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:84%
We traced it to softeners in the
dryer and another big problem,

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.326 align:middle line:84%
Mike, a lot of people get
their clothes dry cleaned

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:02.128 align:middle line:84%
and when you get your
clothes dry cleaned,

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.831 align:middle line:84%
they use extremely
toxic chemicals.

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:05.932 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:08.234 align:middle line:90%
You put those clothes on, okay,

00:16:08.234 --> 00:16:10.103 align:middle line:84%
this is a fabric
softener right here,

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:12.939 align:middle line:84%
but you also have
laundry detergent as well.

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:15.742 align:middle line:84%
Most laundry detergent
is extremely toxic

00:16:15.742 --> 00:16:19.379 align:middle line:84%
and not only that, back to
water again, you're going

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:21.514 align:middle line:84%
to have toxic compounds
in the water

00:16:21.514 --> 00:16:23.516 align:middle line:84%
that you're washing
your clothes with.

00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:84%
People that have sensitivities,
they put the clothes on,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and especially in the
tight-fitting parts

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.926 align:middle line:84%
of the body where--
around the waistline

00:16:32.926 --> 00:16:35.962 align:middle line:84%
where your body's exposed
to that, your body will suck

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:39.599 align:middle line:84%
up those chemicals and a
lot of people have rashes

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:41.101 align:middle line:90%
and reactions to that.

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:43.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Yeah, it brings up
the question, why do you want

00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:45.872 align:middle line:84%
to bathe your clothes
in perfume?

00:16:45.872 --> 00:16:46.639 align:middle line:90%
I mean, seriously.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:48.074 align:middle line:90%
What's that all about?

00:16:48.074 --> 00:16:50.877 align:middle line:84%
But people have been
trained by the corporations

00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:54.714 align:middle line:84%
to associate a particular
fragrance with the idea

00:16:54.714 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:84%
of detergent or the
idea of clean laundry

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.885 align:middle line:90%
or the idea of fabric softener.

00:16:58.885 --> 00:17:01.621 align:middle line:84%
In truth, detergents don't
need any fragrance whatsoever

00:17:01.621 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
to be effective, and we
brought some examples

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.559 align:middle line:84%
of some laundry products
that are all natural

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:09.262 align:middle line:84%
that don't have any fragrance
and that actually do a great job

00:17:09.262 --> 00:17:10.496 align:middle line:90%
of cleaning your laundry.

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:11.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Yes.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:12.197 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: So let's
show some of those.

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:13.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Okay.

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Two things that
you can do very easily,

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.003 align:middle line:84%
very quickly obviously,
you know,

00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:19.806 align:middle line:90%
super washing soda, baking soda.

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:24.377 align:middle line:84%
It really is natural
and if you get a kind

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.913 align:middle line:84%
that has nothing added to
it, it does a great job

00:17:26.913 --> 00:17:30.383 align:middle line:84%
with your laundry,
especially if you add Borax,

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.452 align:middle line:90%
this 20 Mule Team Borax.

00:17:32.452 --> 00:17:34.287 align:middle line:84%
I actually use this
product myself.

00:17:34.287 --> 00:17:36.523 align:middle line:84%
This is part of what I
wash my laundry with.

00:17:36.523 --> 00:17:39.425 align:middle line:84%
I also throw in some
Dr. Braunner's soap

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:90%
with the laundry.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.128 align:middle line:84%
Here's some of the
soap right here,

00:17:42.128 --> 00:17:45.098 align:middle line:84%
and that gets the laundry
really, really clean

00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:46.666 align:middle line:90%
and you'll notice, Ed, I mean,

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:48.401 align:middle line:84%
you probably wouldn't even
be standing this close to be

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:52.639 align:middle line:84%
if I had my clothes
smelling like Gain, right,

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:54.774 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't stand
to be that close.

00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:56.109 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: No, I
couldn't you know,

00:17:56.109 --> 00:17:58.711 align:middle line:84%
and what I use is I use
soap nuts for my laundry

00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:03.216 align:middle line:84%
and I also use soap nuts for
my dishwashing detergent too.

00:18:03.216 --> 00:18:06.719 align:middle line:84%
It works so good that it
just keeps everything clean.

00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:09.322 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of soap nut
trees down here in the south

00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:12.792 align:middle line:84%
and we can actually make
our own laundry detergent

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:90%
and dishwashing detergent.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.262 align:middle line:84%
But another point
that, you know,

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:19.532 align:middle line:84%
we talk about a lot is the
fact that dishes, I mean think

00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:23.937 align:middle line:84%
of how many people that wash
their dishes and their glasses

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:27.607 align:middle line:90%
in toxic dishwashing detergent.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:28.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It's incredible.

00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:30.677 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and that's something
you eat off of right.

00:18:30.677 --> 00:18:32.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: That's
something you eat and drink

00:18:32.078 --> 00:18:33.646 align:middle line:90%
out of, yes, absolutely.

00:18:33.646 --> 00:18:34.881 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Let me show
you some other things.

00:18:34.881 --> 00:18:37.183 align:middle line:84%
Oh, but real quickly
Seventh Generation is a brand

00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:38.418 align:middle line:84%
that you're probably
familiar with.

00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:40.153 align:middle line:90%
I like that brand.

00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:41.888 align:middle line:84%
This is a product
that's free and clear.

00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:44.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have any
perfumes or dyes.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.758 align:middle line:90%
Now another big category

00:18:45.758 --> 00:18:48.328 align:middle line:84%
that really gets
people is air fresheners

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:51.998 align:middle line:84%
and they buy these
toxic air fresheners,

00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:55.034 align:middle line:84%
which just push artificial
fragrance right into the air

00:18:55.034 --> 00:18:56.469 align:middle line:84%
and there are a lot
of studies linking

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.104 align:middle line:90%
that to allergies and asthma.

00:18:58.104 --> 00:18:59.939 align:middle line:84%
Well there are natural
alternatives to that

00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:02.709 align:middle line:84%
like this product here,
pure citrus orange.

00:19:02.709 --> 00:19:06.045 align:middle line:84%
It's just orange
concentrate, like an orange peel

00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:08.781 align:middle line:84%
or orange essential oils that
you can put into the air,

00:19:08.781 --> 00:19:10.283 align:middle line:90%
gives it a nice, fresh scent.

00:19:10.283 --> 00:19:13.519 align:middle line:84%
You can also buy an
aromatherapy diffuser.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.388 align:middle line:84%
This is my favorite
solution if you want

00:19:15.388 --> 00:19:18.057 align:middle line:84%
to put some nice
fragrance into your air.

00:19:18.057 --> 00:19:20.226 align:middle line:84%
Just get some essential
oils, you put them

00:19:20.226 --> 00:19:23.363 align:middle line:84%
into this unit here, you plug
it in and you don't even have

00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:25.265 align:middle line:90%
to add water or oil or anything

00:19:25.265 --> 00:19:28.835 align:middle line:84%
and this puts those essential
oils, which are therapeutic.

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:29.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.806 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Into the air and those
oils can actually kill bacteria

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:37.377 align:middle line:84%
and in essence, sterilize
any harmful pathogens

00:19:37.377 --> 00:19:38.678 align:middle line:90%
that might be in the air.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.414 align:middle line:84%
So there's even a medicinal
effect from that as well.

00:19:41.414 --> 00:19:42.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Absolutely.

00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:43.916 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you talk
about air fresheners,

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:46.653 align:middle line:84%
I mean people use these air
fresheners in their cars

00:19:46.653 --> 00:19:51.024 align:middle line:84%
and it is extremely toxic
and also the air fresheners,

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.759 align:middle line:90%
candles, I mean a lot

00:19:52.759 --> 00:19:55.495 align:middle line:84%
of the candles are scented
with toxic chemicals.

00:19:55.495 --> 00:19:58.765 align:middle line:84%
And when you burn candles in
the house, you're getting all

00:19:58.765 --> 00:20:02.201 align:middle line:84%
that chemical smoke that's
coming up in there too.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:05.204 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, and another thing,
if people, if you have a smoker

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:10.043 align:middle line:84%
in the house, that's a whole
nother reason you for sure need

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:12.312 align:middle line:84%
to have air purification
going on.

00:20:12.312 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Watch out
around Christmas time.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.683 align:middle line:84%
Don't buy people gifts that
are these scented candles

00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:19.352 align:middle line:84%
and don't let people
give you scented candles.

00:20:19.352 --> 00:20:20.553 align:middle line:90%
If they do, say what?

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:22.388 align:middle line:84%
Are you trying to
poison me again?

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Last year you got
me a fruitcake.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.359 align:middle line:84%
This year you got
me a toxic candle.

00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:27.727 align:middle line:90%
Take it back.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.629 align:middle line:84%
I don't want that stuff for
Christmas, thank you very much.

00:20:29.629 --> 00:20:32.598 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: We know
you love fruitcakes.

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:35.601 align:middle line:84%
But aromatherapy
diffusers, I mean I agree.

00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:37.337 align:middle line:90%
Those are absolutely amazing.

00:20:37.337 --> 00:20:39.706 align:middle line:84%
I mean, talk about just
everybody being calm.

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:43.176 align:middle line:84%
You know, people are so
stressed out these days, Mike.

00:20:43.176 --> 00:20:45.912 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you talk about,
and you look at the environment

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:48.548 align:middle line:84%
that people go to work in and
then they have to come home,

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:53.119 align:middle line:84%
an aromatherapy diffuser is
a wonderful way to just relax

00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:56.155 align:middle line:84%
with your family
and keep a calm,

00:20:56.155 --> 00:20:57.991 align:middle line:84%
you can put different things
in there like lavender,

00:20:57.991 --> 00:21:00.393 align:middle line:84%
which calms everybody
down and it's just amazing

00:21:00.393 --> 00:21:03.029 align:middle line:84%
to clean the air and to give
everything a good smell.

00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:05.198 align:middle line:84%
Look, if you're waking
up and you're, you know,

00:21:05.198 --> 00:21:09.902 align:middle line:84%
you have swelling and you
have headaches, look and see

00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:11.637 align:middle line:90%
or go get a test for mold

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:84%
because if you have
chronic sinus infections,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.509 align:middle line:84%
most likely that could
be because of dust mites,

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:17.710 align:middle line:90%
it could be because of mold.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.645 align:middle line:84%
If anybody in your
house has allergies,

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:21.614 align:middle line:90%
check for that as well.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:23.716 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I want
to talk about,

00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:28.755 align:middle line:84%
what most people don't know,
and this is huge, is dust mites.

00:21:28.755 --> 00:21:29.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, yeah.

00:21:29.589 --> 00:21:30.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: Listen to this.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
More than 100,000
dust mites can live

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.863 align:middle line:84%
in a single square
yard of carpet.

00:21:36.863 --> 00:21:39.699 align:middle line:84%
Now take a look at this picture
of what dust mites look like,

00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:41.601 align:middle line:84%
and you can't see
these with your eye.

00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:43.102 align:middle line:90%
That's the scary thing.

00:21:43.102 --> 00:21:46.472 align:middle line:84%
Most people are sleeping and
if you have pets in your home,

00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:50.576 align:middle line:84%
what dust mites feed off of, is
they feed off your skin flakes

00:21:50.576 --> 00:21:53.679 align:middle line:84%
and your pet's skin flakes
and they go to the bathroom

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's the dust mite droppings
that are really dangerous.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: It looks like a scene

00:21:58.284 --> 00:22:00.219 align:middle line:84%
from the flea bag
motel in Vegas.

00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:02.155 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah,
well listen to this.

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:03.589 align:middle line:90%
A typical--

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:05.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: You were just in
Vegas at a trade show too.

00:22:05.258 --> 00:22:06.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: I was.

00:22:06.225 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I was, a manufacturing
trade show.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.195 align:middle line:90%
But listen to this.

00:22:09.195 --> 00:22:12.432 align:middle line:90%
A typical used mattress may have

00:22:12.432 --> 00:22:16.335 align:middle line:84%
up to 10 million
dust mites inside.

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:18.104 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: It's like
an extra bonus too.

00:22:18.104 --> 00:22:19.705 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
to pay for that.

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:21.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah, you
have living creatures

00:22:21.507 --> 00:22:23.009 align:middle line:84%
that are literally
living in your bed.

00:22:23.009 --> 00:22:24.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: You're freaking me out.

00:22:24.277 --> 00:22:27.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: A 10 percent,
10 percent of the weight

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:31.651 align:middle line:84%
of a two year old pillow can
be composed of dead mites

00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:33.586 align:middle line:84%
and their droppings, 10
percent of the weight.

00:22:33.586 --> 00:22:36.422 align:middle line:84%
Look, if you pick your
pillow up and it feels heavy,

00:22:36.422 --> 00:22:37.924 align:middle line:90%
how many people do you know

00:22:37.924 --> 00:22:40.359 align:middle line:84%
that change their pillow
on a regular basis?

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:41.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Oh, man.

00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:42.428 align:middle line:90%
That would be scary.

00:22:42.428 --> 00:22:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Like hey honey, when I bought
you this pillow two years ago it

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.532 align:middle line:84%
was only two pounds,
now it's four.

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:47.767 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:22:47.767 --> 00:22:49.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Well listen,
here's the solution.

00:22:49.335 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Go get dust mite free bedding,
get dust mite free pillows.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.408 align:middle line:90%
They make them.

00:22:55.408 --> 00:22:57.844 align:middle line:84%
They're hypoallergenic, and
they even make dust mite free

00:22:57.844 --> 00:22:59.412 align:middle line:90%
pillowcases these days.

00:22:59.412 --> 00:23:00.813 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: And bed bug protection.

00:23:00.813 --> 00:23:02.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And bed
bug protection too.

00:23:02.281 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Oh, talking
about bug protection,

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.918 align:middle line:90%
I got to show people this.

00:23:05.918 --> 00:23:08.788 align:middle line:84%
This product here
is called Venture,

00:23:08.788 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have any financial
ties to this product by the way.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.659 align:middle line:90%
I just bring stuff that I use.

00:23:13.659 --> 00:23:17.597 align:middle line:84%
It's a bug/insect killer
that's based on lemon grass oil

00:23:17.597 --> 00:23:19.999 align:middle line:84%
and there are several
products like this out there.

00:23:19.999 --> 00:23:21.601 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually,
if you get this

00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:23.469 align:middle line:84%
on your skin, it's
not a problem.

00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:26.339 align:middle line:84%
You can inhale the fumes
so to speak from it.

00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:28.174 align:middle line:90%
It's just natural essential oil.

00:23:28.174 --> 00:23:29.375 align:middle line:90%
It's really nice actually.

00:23:29.375 --> 00:23:31.844 align:middle line:84%
It makes your home smell
great and it kills bugs.

00:23:31.844 --> 00:23:35.581 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a problem
with insects in your home,

00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:39.118 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to resort
to turning your home

00:23:39.118 --> 00:23:41.654 align:middle line:90%
to a chemical cocktail zone.

00:23:41.654 --> 00:23:45.191 align:middle line:84%
You know how schools have
the sign a gun-free zone,

00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:48.394 align:middle line:84%
and then sometimes they
have a sign drug-free zone?

00:23:48.394 --> 00:23:51.297 align:middle line:84%
I want my home to be like
a chemical free zone.

00:23:51.297 --> 00:23:52.498 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm interested in.

00:23:52.498 --> 00:23:54.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And one
more thing too is I want

00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:55.535 align:middle line:90%
to talk about radon.

00:23:55.535 --> 00:23:57.637 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you don't
have a radon detector,

00:23:57.637 --> 00:23:59.105 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's very common.

00:23:59.105 --> 00:24:02.308 align:middle line:84%
It's also a toxic compound
that a lot of people breathe

00:24:02.308 --> 00:24:03.843 align:middle line:84%
in that's emitted
from their homes.

00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:84%
So make sure you get your
house tested for radon as well.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Good point, and
we'll talk about radiation

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:12.084 align:middle line:84%
in another show and I know
you've got some more quotes,

00:24:12.084 --> 00:24:16.355 align:middle line:84%
but let me throw this in there
first because your shower is

00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:18.391 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of people
are really exposed

00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:20.326 align:middle line:90%
to some highly toxic stuff.

00:24:20.326 --> 00:24:22.495 align:middle line:90%
I have to plug Dr. Braunner's.

00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:24.397 align:middle line:84%
If you're not using
Dr. Braunner's soap,

00:24:24.397 --> 00:24:25.698 align:middle line:90%
you're missing out.

00:24:25.698 --> 00:24:29.201 align:middle line:84%
This is the best soap on the
planet and in the shower,

00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:32.071 align:middle line:84%
this is what you need to
avoid the toxic fragrance.

00:24:32.071 --> 00:24:35.408 align:middle line:84%
I have-- if you go to the
regular store or Wal-Mart

00:24:35.408 --> 00:24:38.844 align:middle line:84%
or a grocery store and you
buy soaps for the shower,

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:43.082 align:middle line:84%
they are enundated with
toxic fragrance chemicals.

00:24:43.082 --> 00:24:44.483 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:47.653 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea why anyone
would want to coat their skin

00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:49.188 align:middle line:90%
with those chemicals and then--

00:24:49.188 --> 00:24:51.657 align:middle line:84%
and have it in their hair
with shampoo and, you know,

00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:54.093 align:middle line:84%
scrub their face
with these chemicals.

00:24:54.093 --> 00:24:58.164 align:middle line:84%
Use Dr. Braunner's or other
truly natural fragrance free

00:24:58.164 --> 00:25:00.866 align:middle line:84%
products and you will be
healthier for doing so.

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:02.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Figi is
another good soap to use,

00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:06.739 align:middle line:84%
but basically look, it all comes
down to just using your mind

00:25:06.739 --> 00:25:09.275 align:middle line:84%
and just every time you
need to go to the store

00:25:09.275 --> 00:25:13.879 align:middle line:84%
and buy something, the next time
just say look at the ingredients

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:17.083 align:middle line:84%
and say do I even understand
anything on this ingredient?

00:25:17.083 --> 00:25:19.051 align:middle line:84%
If you don't understand
what it is, I mean,

00:25:19.051 --> 00:25:20.586 align:middle line:90%
if you have the time, you know,

00:25:20.586 --> 00:25:22.188 align:middle line:84%
type it into your
phone and look it up.

00:25:22.188 --> 00:25:23.856 align:middle line:84%
Do a little Google
search for it.

00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:26.459 align:middle line:90%
If it's toxic, don't buy it.

00:25:26.459 --> 00:25:29.395 align:middle line:84%
Just start buying everything
you need for the home,

00:25:29.395 --> 00:25:31.297 align:middle line:84%
start buying natural
and organic.

00:25:31.297 --> 00:25:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Even the next time you need
to replace your carpet,

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:84%
or you want to, you know,
do something in your house,

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.272 align:middle line:84%
your couch or your
drapes or something,

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:42.742 align:middle line:84%
replace it with non-toxic,
organic,

00:25:42.742 --> 00:25:45.344 align:middle line:90%
non-out-gassing alternatives.

00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:49.582 align:middle line:84%
Next time you need to paint
your walls in your home,

00:25:49.582 --> 00:25:52.918 align:middle line:84%
there's a great clay
organic paints right now

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:84%
that people can use and
they're based on clay

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:84%
so they actually absorb
toxins in the air.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:58.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: That's right.

00:25:58.991 --> 00:26:01.927 align:middle line:84%
And also in terms of
your health benefits,

00:26:01.927 --> 00:26:04.897 align:middle line:84%
let me mention this
really important point,

00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:08.234 align:middle line:84%
if you're loaded with
fragrance products right now,

00:26:08.234 --> 00:26:10.369 align:middle line:90%
it is dulling your senses.

00:26:10.369 --> 00:26:13.739 align:middle line:84%
You're not able to taste
the diversity of foods,

00:26:13.739 --> 00:26:16.242 align:middle line:84%
you're not able to even
think with the diversity

00:26:16.242 --> 00:26:19.812 align:middle line:84%
of cognitive function that your
brain was built to perform.

00:26:19.812 --> 00:26:22.515 align:middle line:84%
Studies have shown that if
you're inundating yourself

00:26:22.515 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:84%
with chemicals, you're
dumbing yourself down

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.853 align:middle line:84%
and you're destroying your
ability to taste real foods.

00:26:27.853 --> 00:26:30.756 align:middle line:84%
So once you get rid of
all of these perfumes

00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:33.759 align:middle line:84%
in your laundry perfumes
and personal care products,

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:37.163 align:middle line:84%
the dryer sheets, the fabric
softeners, the air fresheners

00:26:37.163 --> 00:26:39.498 align:middle line:84%
that are toxic chemicals,
when you eliminate all

00:26:39.498 --> 00:26:42.868 align:middle line:84%
of those things, Ed, you're
actually going to wake up

00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:45.638 align:middle line:90%
and enliven your senses.

00:26:45.638 --> 00:26:48.574 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is going to be
functioning at a higher level,

00:26:48.574 --> 00:26:50.576 align:middle line:84%
your sense of smell
will work better,

00:26:50.576 --> 00:26:54.013 align:middle line:84%
your sense of taste will be--
will have a more diverse range,

00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:57.883 align:middle line:84%
you will have more enjoyment of
life and your head will be clear

00:26:57.883 --> 00:26:59.518 align:middle line:84%
to actually think about
what you want to do

00:26:59.518 --> 00:27:02.088 align:middle line:84%
and pursue your life's goals
with a sense of happiness.

00:27:02.088 --> 00:27:03.456 align:middle line:90%
It really is a big deal.

00:27:03.456 --> 00:27:06.192 align:middle line:84%
It's not just cancer,
it's not just disease.

00:27:06.192 --> 00:27:07.727 align:middle line:90%
This is about happiness.

00:27:07.727 --> 00:27:12.498 align:middle line:84%
This is about living life
in its full abundance

00:27:12.498 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
by eliminating these
chemicals from your life.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: I mean who wants
to suffer every single day.

00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:20.005 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know people and saw
patients that suffered for years

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:23.576 align:middle line:84%
and years and years
with chronic allergies,

00:27:23.576 --> 00:27:27.012 align:middle line:84%
eye allergies, chronic
sinusitis.

00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:28.247 align:middle line:84%
They would wake up
in the morning

00:27:28.247 --> 00:27:31.150 align:middle line:84%
with a stopped up
nose, sore throat.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.952 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and what
do they do, Mike?

00:27:32.952 --> 00:27:34.687 align:middle line:90%
They go to the doctor's office

00:27:34.687 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and they get prescribed
allergy medications.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:42.495 align:middle line:84%
The doctors do not treat the
root cause of the problem.

00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:43.829 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
saying, you know,

00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:46.465 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be a good doctor,
you have to start looking

00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:50.202 align:middle line:84%
at the patient's environment,
or if you want to figure

00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:53.139 align:middle line:84%
out why you're not
feeling good, start looking

00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:54.907 align:middle line:84%
at your own environment,
start looking

00:27:54.907 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:84%
at what you expose yourself
to on a daily basis,

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.779 align:middle line:84%
start eliminating
those chemicals

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:02.782 align:middle line:84%
and start eliminating those
toxins and you'll get better.

00:28:02.782 --> 00:28:05.451 align:middle line:84%
Think of all of the millions
of dollars, or the thousands

00:28:05.451 --> 00:28:07.019 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of dollars

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:11.157 align:middle line:84%
that people spend
on doctor's visits--

00:28:11.157 --> 00:28:12.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Yes.

00:28:12.525 --> 00:28:14.193 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: And prescription
medications that do nothing

00:28:14.193 --> 00:28:16.729 align:middle line:84%
but put a Band-aid over
the symptoms instead

00:28:16.729 --> 00:28:17.963 align:middle line:90%
of addressing the root cause.

00:28:17.963 --> 00:28:20.766 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Think about your
cells, the environment

00:28:20.766 --> 00:28:22.835 align:middle line:84%
of your cells is
actually the environment

00:28:22.835 --> 00:28:24.637 align:middle line:90%
of everything that you absorb.

00:28:24.637 --> 00:28:27.973 align:middle line:84%
And you absorb things through
what you eat, what you drink,

00:28:27.973 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
what you inhale from your indoor
air and also the things you put

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.746 align:middle line:84%
on your skin, the
personal care products.

00:28:33.746 --> 00:28:36.482 align:middle line:84%
This is what creates the
environment for your cells

00:28:36.482 --> 00:28:39.919 align:middle line:84%
and if your cells are bathed
in poisons all day long,

00:28:39.919 --> 00:28:42.721 align:middle line:84%
then your cells are going
to have a toxic function.

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have cancer,
you're going to have disease,

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.992 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
pain and suffering.

00:28:46.992 --> 00:28:49.628 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually clean
up your environment,

00:28:49.628 --> 00:28:53.332 align:middle line:84%
then your blood gets clean, your
cells have a cleaner environment

00:28:53.332 --> 00:28:55.835 align:middle line:84%
and as people like Dr.
Bruce Lipton talk about,

00:28:55.835 --> 00:28:58.637 align:middle line:84%
cells are intelligent,
their membranes interact

00:28:58.637 --> 00:29:01.006 align:middle line:84%
with their environment
in highly complex ways.

00:29:01.006 --> 00:29:02.274 align:middle line:84%
When you have a clean
environment,

00:29:02.274 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
your cells are happy, your
organs function better,

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.413 align:middle line:84%
your entire body
functions better,

00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:09.048 align:middle line:90%
your mind functions better,

00:29:09.048 --> 00:29:10.950 align:middle line:84%
you have greater
spiritual awareness too

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.553 align:middle line:84%
because now you have this clear
thinking, now you can enjoy life

00:29:14.553 --> 00:29:16.722 align:middle line:84%
without chemicals
destroying your health.

00:29:16.722 --> 00:29:18.357 align:middle line:90%
It's really powerful.

00:29:18.357 --> 00:29:19.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Group: It's all

00:29:19.558 --> 00:29:21.026 align:middle line:84%
about taking responsibility
for your own health.

00:29:21.026 --> 00:29:22.895 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody,
this is what I teach,

00:29:22.895 --> 00:29:26.432 align:middle line:84%
everybody has a self-healing
mechanism within.

00:29:26.432 --> 00:29:29.802 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the most powerful
medicine is already inside

00:29:29.802 --> 00:29:30.703 align:middle line:90%
of you.

00:29:30.703 --> 00:29:32.071 align:middle line:90%
You just need to activate it.

00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:35.507 align:middle line:84%
And the easiest way to activate
it is to clean your body.

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:39.178 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one thing that's
never taught is the fact

00:29:39.178 --> 00:29:42.748 align:middle line:84%
that we take a shower every
single day to clean the outside

00:29:42.748 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:84%
of our body, but
nobody cleans the inside

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.785 align:middle line:84%
of their body on
a regular basis.

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:49.388 align:middle line:84%
We're exposed to
a massive amount

00:29:49.388 --> 00:29:50.923 align:middle line:90%
of chemicals every single day.

00:29:50.923 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It's time that we all
take responsibility

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.063 align:middle line:84%
and start cleaning the inside
of our bodies and start looking

00:29:58.063 --> 00:30:01.500 align:middle line:84%
at what we're putting in our
homes and inside of our body

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.437 align:middle line:84%
through different types of toxic
foods and start making a change

00:30:05.437 --> 00:30:08.607 align:middle line:84%
because how we get
these chemical companies

00:30:08.607 --> 00:30:10.743 align:middle line:84%
out of business is
we switch over--

00:30:10.743 --> 00:30:12.578 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Stop buying
their product.

00:30:12.578 --> 00:30:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Yeah,
stop buying the product.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.448 align:middle line:84%
>> Mike: Vote with your
dollars, protect your health.

00:30:16.448 --> 00:30:19.618 align:middle line:84%
I hope you learned a lot of
great information here today.

00:30:19.618 --> 00:30:22.254 align:middle line:84%
This is Mike and Ed

00:30:22.254 --> 00:30:23.489 align:middle line:90%
Definitely take our advice.

00:30:23.489 --> 00:30:25.925 align:middle line:84%
Use these healthy products,
eliminate the chemicals

00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:28.227 align:middle line:84%

00:30:28.227 --> 00:30:29.995 align:middle line:90%
and your happiness as a result.

00:30:29.995 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching today.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:32.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Group: Thanks
for joining us.
