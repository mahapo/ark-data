to Secrets

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%

I'm Mike Adams of

&gt;&gt; Mike: And today's episode is
about your home food makeover,

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and that's what this
is all about.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.277 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This table, it contains
healthy stuff

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:45.979 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and it contains crazy
stuff that neither one

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.249 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of us would normally ever
be near, but we're doing it.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.387 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We're sacrificing our health
to show you what not to eat.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.889 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, I
mean, I've gone in pantries

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of people's homes
and literally seen

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:01.495 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
over 200 different
chemical-based food items

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:04.031 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
in their pantry,
in their cabinets

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.533 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and in their refrigerator
and in this freezer,

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and today's episode, what we
want to do is just take some

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:13.373 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the more common items
that you use on a daily basis

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.843 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and teach you how to
replace those toxic items

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
with nontoxic items.

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:21.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Let's get started
with Doritos here, Ed,

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because I know a lot of people

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
like to eat Doritos,
but it contains MSG.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:28.255 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's got crazy chemicals in it.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.957 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's got artificial coloring.

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:33.126 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's got a chemical
called disodium guanylate.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.062 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Sounds like guano.

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:37.497 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Mike: But it's another
flavoring chemical.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.632 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You know, why would
you eat this?

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Why would you feed
this to your kids?

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.234 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You know, that's crazy.

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:42.502 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Let's get that out of here.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:43.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You know how
many millions and billions

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.839 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of dollars these companies make

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.575 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
by selling these toxic
chips and everything?

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:49.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.877 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I mean,
seriously folks.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
All these chips, this is
why we chose the chips

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because people eat these every
single day, a bag of them,

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:00.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
or their family goes through
a bag of them and it's MSG,

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which is an excitotoxin too.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.424 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Mike: GMO corn,
it's got GMC's in it.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:07.494 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Now, let's talk about the
replacement is Rhythm Super

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:12.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Foods Kale Chips, nacho
favor, zesty nacho flavor.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This tastes, to me this tastes
better than Doritos and it's

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.071 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
so much healthier for you.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.841 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yes, any
type of, you know, nowadays

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:23.744 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and every month that goes by,
you're starting to get more

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:26.313 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and more natural
placements for everything

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:28.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and that's what this
show's all about.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.884 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Look, I like the
Amy's brand too.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I mean, they have some
gluten-free chips.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
They have a cool ranch
chips that taste just

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:39.526 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
like the cool ranch Doritos
except they're healthier

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
for you, they have organic
ingredients in there.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They're certified organic.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:46.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's all about making that
switch from toxic to organic

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:48.568 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and that's why we
want to show you some

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:49.936 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of these alternatives to chips.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.538 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I mean, popcorn right here.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:54.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Well, let me show
you first of all, the bad side

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:58.011 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of that, Cheetos, another
popular snack food.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.613 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
If you look at the
ingredients on Cheetos,

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:03.984 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
it's also enriched
cornmeal, GMO, right.

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:05.585 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So that's what that contains,

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:08.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
plus you've got monosodium
glutamate and all kinds

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:11.358 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of odd milk extracts,
yellow number 6,

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
artificial colors,
things like that.

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:15.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So this is another product
that I would not want

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to feed someone that
I cared about.

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:19.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I wouldn't want to eat
it myself, you know.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.401 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So what do you replace it with?

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:25.138 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: But Mike, it is
made with real cheese though.

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, real cheese.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Cheese from bovine
growth hormone injected cattle

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:32.112 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
by the way and extremely toxic.

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:34.881 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I mean, you wonder why
everyone has skin reactions

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:38.318 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and allergies, because
GMO's, which don't forget

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:41.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to watch our episode on
GMO's which is incredible,

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.257 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the BT toxin burns holes through
the intestinal lining and all

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:48.361 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of these chemicals and toxins
go through into the bloodstream.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:52.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So replace all your chips,
all the popular chips

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:55.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
with natural healthy
replacements.

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And here's an example
of a natural replacement.

00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:01.575 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Angie's sweet and
spicy kettle corn,

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:04.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
non-GMO project verified
everybody.

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:10.317 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So this is-- it tastes-- I
mean, it's an amazing taste

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:11.585 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but there's no MSG in it,

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.721 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
there's no artificial
colors and it's not GMO.

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.022 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So this is the kind of product

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.591 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that you really want
to seek out.

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Angie's is a great
brand of popcorn.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They've got different flavors.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They've got plain also.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.264 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You don't have to get flavored.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.532 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You could also just
get plain popcorn.

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:26.333 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It's a whole grain.

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.001 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It's got lots of fiber.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It helps bind with other
things that you eat

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.405 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and flush them out
of your system.

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:35.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
It kind of has its
own detox effect.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:35.909 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah,
and the thing is,

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.244 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
you know, it's hard for people.

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:38.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I get this all the time.

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:39.779 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They're saying, well
it just doesn't taste

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.648 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
as good as the real brands.

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:46.486 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The reason why those brands,
the chemical toxic brands taste

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:50.524 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
so good is because they use
chemicals, addictive chemicals.

00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:55.061 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
They want you to become addicted
to their product so you buy more

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:56.863 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and buy more and buy more.

00:04:56.863 --> 00:05:01.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It takes the body a little bit
of time to adapt to new flavors,

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:05.572 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
especially natural flavors,
but it will and you will start

00:05:05.572 --> 00:05:08.975 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to enjoy just as much the
natural organic things

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
as you did the toxic
chemical compounds.

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:14.514 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Well the truth is,
most Americans in particular are

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:17.651 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
so addicted to salt and sugar

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:21.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that their taste buds almost
can't taste anything else.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.058 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I mean they can't taste
the subtitles in food

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:28.028 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
so they don't sometimes
appreciate real food

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:29.262 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
because they can't
even taste it.

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:31.498 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
All they want is salt
and sugar and fat.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:32.766 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You know, those are
the main tastes

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:34.367 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that the food companies
cater to.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.937 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
That's why everything has
salt, sugar or fat in it.

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:38.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But let's move on.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.106 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
We've got a lot of
ground to cover here.

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:41.508 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You're right.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:42.776 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's all fake food and that's
what we're talking about today.

00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:44.177 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Fake food.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:48.215 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Now we did have some fake beef
jerky here, but we decided not

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to show that on camera
because it's just too toxic.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.419 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I'm going to show you
some healthy ones.

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.823 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is Organic Golden
Valley Natural Beef Jerky.

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.858 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now again, I know many of
you watching are vegans

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.727 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
or vegetarians and you're
not into eating beef,

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:03.096 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but a lot of people
are into jerky products

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:05.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
or high protein diet people.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.334 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Here's another product
called Nick's Sticks,

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:10.737 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which is like a Slim Jim kind
of replacement but healthy,

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:14.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
no hormones, certified
organic I believe.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
These are the kinds of
products that you can have

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:20.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
as safe alternatives to
those processed beef jerkies

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.115 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that you get at the
grocery store.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:25.852 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Almost all of which contain
MSG and sodium nitrite,

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:29.389 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
so cancer causing chemicals
in your typical beef jerkies.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.324 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Right, and I mean
people out there that eat meat

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:34.327 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and eat steaks and eat
chicken and eat fish out there,

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.096 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I mean the problem with meat is

00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:39.733 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that it's not natural these
days, the cows, the pigs,

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
all that stuff, the animals,

00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
they're not grazing
on pure grass.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.274 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
What they're doing is they're
grazing on insecticide,

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:53.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
pesticide sprayed grass, GMO
corn and so what you get,

00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:54.381 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because a lot of the chemicals

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and the toxins are
stored in the fat tissue.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And so what you get is you get
a slew of chemicals and the cows

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:02.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and the slaughter houses are
schizophrenic at the time

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of butchering so they have
all their stress hormones,

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:08.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
they rush to the meat
when they get butchered.

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:12.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The problem is that
it's extremely toxic

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:15.368 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because you have heavy metals,
you have insecticide residue,

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:19.005 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you have recommon in both
growth hormone in the meat,

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:21.074 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
you have antibiotic
residue in there.

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:22.442 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: PCB's.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.744 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You have all these
toxins and chemicals coming

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:28.048 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
into the meat and your body
is not necessarily meat

00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:29.649 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to break down the meat.

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:32.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I mean, the way out teeth are,
we're not really carnivorous.

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:35.188 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We've developed and
adapted over the years,

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:37.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
but we don't have a
pipe-like digestive system

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:40.927 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
like carnivorous animals do, we
don't have canine teeth to rip

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:43.897 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and chew flesh, we don't have
hydrochloric acids secreted

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:46.399 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in our mouth like
carnivorous animals do.

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:49.936 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So you know my recommendation
is if you're going to eat meat,

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:54.874 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
natural replacements, grass fed
organic beef, anything that--

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:55.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, and limit it.

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:57.377 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Is very
low and limit it.

00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:59.279 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Keep it--
keep the portions small

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:01.848 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
or I eat a little bit of
meat right now by the way.

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:03.883 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I've been a vegan,
I've been a vegetarian,

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:08.288 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
but living on a ranch in Texas I
found I really need more density

00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in the food just to be able
to do the farm work that I do.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.492 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So I eat a little bit of
meat, I eat a little bit

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of goat milk from our goats.

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:16.696 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I eat chicken eggs from
our own chickens we raise.

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:18.198 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
We raise chickens
to produce eggs.

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:21.568 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So I do eat some of
those foods and I think

00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:25.805 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that vegetarianism is a great
detox diet, but it's really hard

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:28.541 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to live on a ranch and be
100 percent vegetarian.

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.910 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
So I try to find
balance in that.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, and you made
a good point with milk too.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.417 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I mean milk is another extremely
toxic substance out there,

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:39.753 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
especially if it's been
pasteurized and homogenized.

00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:43.757 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I mean they've found, you
know, a massive amount of pus

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:45.625 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in the milk because
most of the cows

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:49.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that are milked have
mastitis going on and a slew

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:52.465 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of other chemicals,
insecticides, blood in milk

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:56.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and I think the FDA even allows,
you know, a massive amount

00:08:56.002 --> 00:09:00.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of particles per cup of pus
and they say that it's safe.

00:09:00.507 --> 00:09:04.244 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But milk is-- it causes
an allergic reaction.

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:07.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I mean, if it's raw it's
okay, raw goat's milk.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:08.548 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Mike: It's digestible.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:09.716 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Raw cow's milk.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.251 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
I would recommend
raw goat's milk.

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:12.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Absolutely.

00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Because I think
it's better than cow's milk.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:19.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But some natural alternatives
to milk would be an almond milk,

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:25.131 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
let's say, or a hemp
milk or a coconut milk.

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:26.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Definitely.

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:27.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Or you can
even mix the different types

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:32.005 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of natural milks together and,
you know, if you're using milk

00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:34.407 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
for cereal, if you're
using milk for your coffee,

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.444 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
whatever you're using it
for, our recommendation is

00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:41.414 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to switch away from the
pasteurized store bought milk

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
products and either go
with an organic raw milk

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
or a natural almond,
hemp, coconut,

00:09:47.287 --> 00:09:48.288 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
something like that milk.

00:09:48.288 --> 00:09:49.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike: I like almond
milk the best.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.925 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Let's go to some pancake mixes.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:56.696 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now these products here,
Crusty's Blueberry Pancake Mix,

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:59.365 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
this does not contain
blueberries

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:01.301 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and we've done an episode
on fake food ingredients.

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:02.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This is another example.

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:08.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Hungry Jack Easy Pack
Blueberry Wheat Pancake Mix,

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:09.909 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
also does not contain
blueberries.

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:12.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So don't trust the labels.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.148 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Instead, I recommend
this gluten-free.

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:18.084 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
This company's called
1, 2, 3 Gluten-Free.

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:23.156 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
This is a buckwheat and I think
it's got some rice flour in it.

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:25.225 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This is a super delicious
pancake mix.

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:26.359 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
I love this.

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:28.595 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's the best I've ever
found that's gluten-free

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:30.263 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and you can add blueberries
in it.

00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:32.832 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Just take-- just buy some
freeze dried blueberries,

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:36.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
put them in the mix, you
get real blueberry pancakes.

00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:37.971 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
That's what you're looking for.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:41.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So you know, these brand
names that are popular,

00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:43.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
this is what's purchased
by people

00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:45.612 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
who don't know what
they're eating, Ed.

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:47.514 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And they
just don't want to cook.

00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:49.182 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I mean we've came into a society

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:53.286 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
that everybody wants everything
packaged already, ready to eat,

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:55.088 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
easy to put on the table.

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They either microwave it
real fast or they mix it

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
with hot water, tap water
and they put it on the table.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.496 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Here's what we're trying to say,
we know where that's gotten us.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.932 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It's gotten us a
nation that's sick,

00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:08.201 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
a nation that has too
many chemicals coming

00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:10.637 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in their body every
day from food.

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:11.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Here's what we have to do.

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:12.405 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We have to kind of go back

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:14.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to the roots again
and cook our self.

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:18.044 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I mean cooking is
actually healing in itself.

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:19.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Absolutely.

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:20.747 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Next time instead
of buying the store bought,

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:22.549 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
you know, pancakes or whatever,
I mean I know everybody's

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:26.252 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in a hurry but start looking
at cooking your own meals again

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:29.155 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
because you put energy into
the meals when you cook it.

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:32.025 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
If you're happy, that
happy energy goes in.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:21%
I mean--

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:34.093 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: It doesn't have to
be complicated either, Ed.

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:35.228 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: It doesn't.

00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:36.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Like for
example, just take cereal.

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:39.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You could but this, what
is this, honey nut squares

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:42.035 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
from HEB, which is loaded

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.737 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
with probably corn
syrup and other things.

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:48.775 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
You know, I mean I'm not total--
yeah, corn meal, sugar, honey,

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:54.414 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
corn fiber, brown sugar syrup
on top of the other sugars,

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:56.149 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
so that's pretty wild.

00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:57.584 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
You know, just toss that.

00:11:57.584 --> 00:12:01.487 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Instead, or here's one,
Honey Graham O's from Quaker,

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
kind of processed
refined ingredients,

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.525 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
not your best choice.

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:06.726 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
What's on there?

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:07.961 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Corn flour,
brown sugar, you know,

00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
all the different types
of-- soy bean oil, palm oil,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.865 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
graham flour, corn syrup, BHT.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:15.368 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Mike: It's got to be GMO
too because it's not certified.

00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:17.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: It's
all GMO, absolutely.

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:19.539 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Look, just
go with Nature's Path.

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:22.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is a cereal company
right here, Nature's Path,

00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:25.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
this is the company,
this is the product.

00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:29.482 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Nature's Path Cereals are all
100 percent organic non-GMO

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and that's just-- if you
want to keep it simple,

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:34.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and it takes just as much time
to eat Nature's Path Cereal

00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:36.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
as it does to eat
these other cereals.

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:37.624 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You just make a choice.

00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:39.392 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, let's
say that you eat cereal,

00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:43.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
this toxic cereal in the morning
with toxic milk on top of it.

00:12:43.196 --> 00:12:47.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You might be taking in
50,000 toxins from this.

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:50.103 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
You change the next
day to an organic one

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:51.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
with an all organic
almond or something.

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:56.442 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You've just taken 50,000 toxins
out of your daily life just

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:59.212 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
with one tiny change and it
really didn't even cost you

00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:01.614 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that much difference in cost.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.882 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right, you're really--

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:05.785 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a lot of people complain
about the cost of clean food

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:09.889 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and organic food, but you're
paying for what's not in there.

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:12.925 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You know, you're paying
to be not polluted

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:16.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
with the mercury that's in
corn syrup, for example,

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:19.165 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
high fructose corn syrup, often
contaminated with mercury.

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.634 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
You're paying for the
lack of pesticides

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.102 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and the more people
I think understand

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:26.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
about the toxic effects of these
elements and these chemicals,

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.474 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the more they're going to be
willing to pay a little extra

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.777 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to keep their body free
from those chemicals, so.

00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:32.145 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You know,
you made a good point.

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:36.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's actually very sad that
we have to pay to eat healthy.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.216 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
You know what I mean?

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:38.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:13:38.618 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: It's like, isn't
that where our tax money goes

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.256 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to the government so they can--
the FDA, so they can regulate

00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:45.158 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and take all this stuff
out of food, but--

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Well but speaking
of money, how about this?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.864 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You've got the 100 Grand
candy bar right here.

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:54.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Now 100 Grand isn't what
it used to be thanks

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.736 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to the federal reserve,
quantitative easing

00:13:56.736 --> 00:14:00.373 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and money printing, but it's
still got a lot of sugar in it.

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:02.809 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So what do you do
instead of a candy bar?

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:05.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Well here's-- I've got a lot
of recommendations on that.

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:09.515 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You could go with Bodacious
Banana Bread from Living Nut,

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
this is a great company.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Really delicious, all natural
ingredients, sprouted nuts

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
with banana and sometimes
they'll use maple syrup

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and different ingredients.

00:14:18.658 --> 00:14:19.625 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It's super delicious.

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:20.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Dates.

00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:21.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Dates, yeah, things
like that, or you could go

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.763 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
with even this isn't organic,

00:14:23.763 --> 00:14:27.734 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but the company's called
Kind Nuts and Spices Bar.

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:31.204 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's not organic, but the
ingredients are really simple

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and straightforward, no
crazy stuff in there.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.609 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And then you've got
this, Annie's.

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:38.745 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The Annie's Company, they make
a lot of different products.

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:41.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They have a peanut butter
and jelly chewy granola bar.

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:43.182 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You know, your kids
will love this.

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:45.218 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
This is the kind of
thing that you can use

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.086 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to replace a candy bar.

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:49.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You know, why feed your kids
junk, right, or yourself?

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:51.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You know, it's
not only feeding them junk,

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:54.327 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
but then again, you know,
they're addicted to the sugars,

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:57.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
they start their whole life
eating candy bars, you know,

00:14:57.764 --> 00:15:00.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Halloween comes around and you
have all the candy associated

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.635 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
with Halloween.

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:05.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The fact of the matter is,
all the candy bars out there

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:08.074 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that you're going to get in any
general supermarket are going

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:10.576 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to be extremely toxic
and there are good,

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:13.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
natural alternatives
that, you know,

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:16.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
any natural health food
store now, it used to be

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:18.017 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
where they only had, like,
three or four different types

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:21.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of natural bars but now
they have half an aisle full

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:23.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of natural bars that
you can choose from.

00:15:23.556 --> 00:15:24.390 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: A lot.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.792 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I tell you what I

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:30.163 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
like is the Navitoss [phonetic]
Power Snacks, and we use this

00:15:30.163 --> 00:15:31.731 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in the super food recipe too,

00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:33.699 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which is the cacoa goji
[phonetic] super food

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:36.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and it's basically like
little chocolate brownies.

00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:38.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I mean, it's a great
snack except it's all raw,

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:42.375 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it's very healthy for you and
it fills you up and, you know,

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:43.609 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I'd much rather have this.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.711 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Thank god I was never,
like, addicted to chocolate

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:48.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
or anything like that, but these
are great and they're great

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:50.883 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
for a sweet tooth and
they're actually nutritious.

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:52.118 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Mike: In them--

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:55.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
here's another company
called Little Duck Organics.

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:57.857 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This company makes just
freeze dried fruit snacks,

00:15:57.857 --> 00:15:59.292 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that's all that are
is freeze dried fruit.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.927 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is strawberry and mango.

00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:03.596 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I like to take some of these
and just put them on cereal.

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:05.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They're USDA organic
and if I'm eating

00:16:05.498 --> 00:16:07.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
like a healthy buckwheat cereal,

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:08.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
there's a Quinoa
cereal that's out there.

00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:11.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's like Quinoa O's, kind
of like Cheerios but made

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.207 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
with Quinoa without
the corn syrup,

00:16:14.207 --> 00:16:17.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and you put some freeze
dried fruit on that cereal

00:16:17.043 --> 00:16:19.111 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and you've got yourself
a really delicious bowl

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:22.515 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of cereal that's totally
natural, all organic, you know,

00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:24.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
no crazy ingredients in there.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.285 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So you know, check
out this company.

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:28.487 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Plus, you know,
when you understand this,

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:30.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
then you feel good
about eating it.

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
It's not--

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:33.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Don't go on a
guilt trip on your food.

00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You're
eating all this chemical,

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
toxic, high sugar stuff.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
At least you could say I'm
eating something healthy

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.465 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
and organic.

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:40.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Are you sure you
don't want some Pop Tarts, Ed,

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.102 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
with some sprinkles on top?

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I tell you what?

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:48.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It makes it look really good,
but I know, I'm a label reader

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.843 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and really what we're
trying to say is you have

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to become a label reader
and we keep saying that over

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:55.081 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and over in all the episodes.

00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But really to understand
the food

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.586 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and understand the food
ingredients that you're using

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:03.122 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and that you have in your
kitchen, you really have

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.357 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to understand what's going on.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's really simple though.

00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:08.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If you don't understand what
the name of the ingredient is,

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:12.365 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
if it's something manmade,
then just avoid it at all cost

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.567 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
because that means
that it's not going

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:16.836 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to do anything good
inside your body.

00:17:16.836 --> 00:17:19.538 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It's simplicity, is
it made by nature?

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It works in the body.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.843 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
If it's made by man, it
doesn't work in the body.

00:17:23.843 --> 00:17:25.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And this
is a great example

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of some label claims
on these Pop Tarts.

00:17:26.946 --> 00:17:29.115 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Look, even though
this is a refined,

00:17:29.115 --> 00:17:32.018 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
processed high sugar junk food,

00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:35.054 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
they could still claim
cholesterol free on the label

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:38.658 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and a good source of four B
vitamins and a good source

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:39.859 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of other vitamins and minerals.

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:42.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Well you know, I could
take a vat of mercury

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:43.729 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and say that's cholesterol free.

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:47.934 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You know, I would take a
giant lump of lead and say,

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:49.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that's mercury free, you know.

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.837 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You can always say
it's free of something.

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:53.105 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It doesn't mean it's real food.

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:54.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It doesn't mean it's nutritious.

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:56.909 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So beware of the claims
and these companies,

00:17:56.909 --> 00:18:00.112 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Kellogg's in this case, oh,
and look, sponsor the Olympics.

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: That's crazy.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Athletes.

00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:06.819 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Pop Tarts are a
crazy good part of breakfast.

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:08.821 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, definitely
the crazy is true.

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.756 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But can you imagine
trying to compete

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in the Olympics living
on Pop Tarts?

00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:14.026 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
You would lose.

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:17.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You would not get a gold
medal, a silver medal.

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:18.698 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You would get, like, the--

00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:21.133 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I don't know, the [inaudible]
medal that poisons you

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:22.601 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
when you wear it
around your neck.

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
It's that bad.

00:18:24.003 --> 00:18:26.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: You know, but it
makes the general consumer think

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:29.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that if you eat this, you'll
be like an Olympic athlete.

00:18:29.542 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Well hey, the
Olympics will take money

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
from any poison company.

00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:35.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
McDonald, junk food company,

00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:37.249 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Olympics takes money
from everybody so.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:39.919 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In fact, when I see an
Olympics logo on something,

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:41.721 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
usually in my mind
that's a red flag.

00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:44.724 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's like don't buy that because
they'll take money from anybody.

00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:45.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:47.059 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Mike: But enough about
the Olympics, anyway.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:49.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Some other healthy--
some healthy bars,

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.864 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
this one's called Simple
Squares right here,

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:55.301 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a nut and honey confection.

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:59.638 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This one here is called
Go Raw, Live Granola Bar,

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and it's just a real
simple granola bar.

00:19:02.008 --> 00:19:02.808 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I know they're kind of small.

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:03.843 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They might be hard to see,

00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:05.678 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but there's so many
options out there.

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:07.179 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You don't have to be limited.

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:08.781 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You can shop online.

00:19:08.781 --> 00:19:10.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Amazon.com carries this stuff.

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:13.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You've got a store, I've got a
store, lots of other retailers

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.688 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
out there online with
healthy products.

00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:17.456 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You've got tons of choices.

00:19:17.456 --> 00:19:20.593 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Right, and I mean
with online, the ability online

00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:23.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to search for replacements,
you can slowly, you don't have

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:25.664 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to do everything at
once, but start going

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
through your cabinets, start
going through your pantries

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.302 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and just pick out three
or four different things.

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:32.238 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I mean a lot of people
have soup stocked

00:19:32.238 --> 00:19:34.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in their pantry, toxic soup.

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:37.209 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And what they have is
those are in aluminum cans,

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:40.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
those are high in salt products.

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:44.316 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Speaking of salt, actually we
brought some salt samples here

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:47.820 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
because it's one of the
main food ingredients

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.856 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that is toxic, regular
table salt.

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:53.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And not all salt these
days is iodized anymore.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:57.029 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We just happened to bring
a common toxic salt,

00:19:57.029 --> 00:20:00.433 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which is iodized, but
they've actually taken iodine

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:03.369 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
out of most of the
salt product out there.

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:05.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Now this is highly
processed, bleached,

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:08.107 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it has calcium silicate in it.

00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:10.576 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: This is
actually very dangerous

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:12.278 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
for you to consume.

00:20:12.278 --> 00:20:15.714 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Now what's happened though is
everybody goes to the doctor,

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they have high blood pressure,
they have high cholesterol

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.686 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and the doctor says well,
limit your salt intake.

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:23.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Our body, if you look
at the water in our body

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:27.059 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and measure it, it's almost
exactly the composition

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.394 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
of sea water.

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:32.898 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Our body is supposed to be
salt, just not the toxic salt.

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And when you
say this is dangerous,

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:36.535 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I want to just clarify
what you're referring to is

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:41.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that this is isolated sodium
chloride where normal sea water,

00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:45.010 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
normal healthy human blood
needs to have a full complement

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:50.382 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of minerals, even magnesium
and manganese and zinc

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:53.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and certain species of
chromium for example.

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:56.288 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
These kind of minerals
make the full compliment.

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:59.225 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You know sea water has, I don't
know 80 something minerals.

00:20:59.225 --> 00:21:00.626 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: 84 minerals.

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:02.628 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, and that's what
your blood is supposed to have.

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:04.029 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
That's what food is
supposed to have.

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:08.567 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So you know, Morton Iodized Salt
is, they say it's got purity.

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:09.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
That's true.

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:14.039 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It is pure, but it's pure sodium
chloride with a flow agent.

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:16.442 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It doesn't have these other
elements that you need

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to have complete nutrition.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.614 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Your body, remember,
minerals are catalyst

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:24.049 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
for biological cellular
function.

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:25.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
If you don't have
the right mineral,

00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
you don't have a catalyst
to make something happen,

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.092 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
protein synthesis, the
healing process, transportation

00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:36.061 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of toxins out of your
cells and out of your body,

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:37.796 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
your liver can't function
correctly and so on.

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:42.468 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So by eating this you
are displacing salt

00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:44.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that is a full spectrum salt

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:45.804 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that would provide the
minerals that you need.

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:49.875 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So I just want to be clear,
this itself, you couldn't say

00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:51.577 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that this itself is a poison,

00:21:51.577 --> 00:21:54.313 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but it's displacing the
nutrients that you need

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:59.084 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to stay healthy therefore this
indirectly skews your health

00:21:59.084 --> 00:22:01.654 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and makes you nutrient depleted.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:02.755 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: There's
not a balance

00:22:02.755 --> 00:22:03.822 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of all the minerals that you--

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:04.957 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Exactly.

00:22:04.957 --> 00:22:06.025 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: That's why
I recommend, you know,

00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:08.894 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a Celtic salt or a
Himalayan crystal salt.

00:22:08.894 --> 00:22:12.431 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I mean, this is straight pink
Himalayan crystal salt form,

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:14.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
there's nothing that's
been done to it

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and it has all the 84
minerals that you need

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:19.772 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and it's just a simple
replacement, you know,

00:22:19.772 --> 00:22:22.942 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
replace your toxic
salt with natural salt.

00:22:22.942 --> 00:22:25.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's just another way that
you can become healthy

00:22:25.978 --> 00:22:29.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and eliminate the toxic
chemical based or bleached

00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:31.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
or processed foods
from your life.

00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:32.384 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike: And it tastes
better too.

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:33.686 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The Himalayan salt is really--

00:22:33.686 --> 00:22:34.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: It tastes great.

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:35.988 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Delicious
because it's full spectrum.

00:22:35.988 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
All right, let's talk
about flour next, Ed,

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.659 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
because white flour is
kind of the same situation

00:22:40.659 --> 00:22:43.462 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
where it is refined
and the nutrients

00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that are normally present

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:50.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in the whole grain wheat berry
are lacking here, the fiber,

00:22:50.002 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the oils, some of the proteins
and definitely the minerals

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and phytonutrients or vitamins
are missing from white flour.

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:58.911 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It's just empty calories.

00:22:58.911 --> 00:23:00.779 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, they just
take something very good,

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
like something grown naturally
and process it into a flour.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.952 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Another thing too is
they actually add bromide

00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:08.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to flour these days.

00:23:08.354 --> 00:23:12.157 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They used to add iodine, which
was a very essential nutrient,

00:23:12.157 --> 00:23:14.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and now what's happening
is you're seeing

00:23:14.426 --> 00:23:16.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
so many thyroid dysfunction,
you're seeing

00:23:16.462 --> 00:23:20.499 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
so many deficiencies in iodine
all over the world right now.

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:24.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Bromide is actually a
halogen just like iodine

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.337 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and fluoride and chlorine.

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:26.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Chlorine, yeah.

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:27.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: And that's
also going to fight

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
for the receptor sites in
the thyroid and it's going

00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:31.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to cause major problems.

00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:36.382 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
So some natural replacements to
the white flour would be again,

00:23:36.382 --> 00:23:39.551 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
organic alternatives
such as rye flour,

00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:42.454 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
buckwheat flour, coconut flour.

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:44.757 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
You know, I recommend
a gluten-free diet

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:49.461 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because gluten is a toxin to
the body that's a protein.

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The body doesn't know
how to react to it.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.599 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It causes inflammation
of the intestinal lining,

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:58.203 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
causes celiac disease and really
the majority of people walking

00:23:58.203 --> 00:24:02.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
around out there, I would say
about 70 percent have a reaction

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:05.711 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to gluten every single
time and don't know it.

00:24:05.711 --> 00:24:06.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:24:06.412 --> 00:24:06.979 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Exactly.

00:24:06.979 --> 00:24:08.247 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right.

00:24:08.247 --> 00:24:09.548 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: So you take
people off gluten and all

00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:11.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of the sudden their health
just starts to go get better

00:24:11.483 --> 00:24:13.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and get better and
get better, so.

00:24:13.252 --> 00:24:14.787 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Let's talk about
a couple more replacements.

00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:19.425 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
So instead of drinking a sports
drink like Power Aid or Gatorade

00:24:19.425 --> 00:24:20.426 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
or something like that,

00:24:20.426 --> 00:24:23.362 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I recommend a coconut
water product.

00:24:23.362 --> 00:24:25.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Those are more readily
available now,

00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:27.499 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
but you can also do
something like this.

00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:30.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This company, Actives,
makes different powders.

00:24:30.035 --> 00:24:32.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
This is an organic
blueberry powder.

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:35.908 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You simply mix it with water,
maybe put a little Stevia in it

00:24:35.908 --> 00:24:37.409 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
if you want to sweeten it up,

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:40.612 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you've got a purple-colored
drink

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:43.515 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that is far healthier
for you than this.

00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:46.518 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And if you want the
so-called electrolytes,

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:48.053 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
you've gotta have
electrolytes just

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:52.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
like in the movie Idiocracy,
all that is is basically salt.

00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:55.928 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You put a little salt in with
this, you've got electrolytes.

00:24:55.928 --> 00:24:57.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
You know, it's not
that complicated.

00:24:57.329 --> 00:25:00.099 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: But yeah, just put
a little Himalayan crystal salt

00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:01.600 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in there and then you
have your electrolytes.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.204 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Or what you can do is add
a little organic apple

00:25:05.204 --> 00:25:06.205 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
cider vinegar.

00:25:06.205 --> 00:25:07.339 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I love this stuff.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:10.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I mean, it has all kinds
of minerals, it's alive,

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:14.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
it's got enzymes, it's got
all the different types

00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:16.148 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of probiotics in there.

00:25:16.148 --> 00:25:17.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I mean this thing is incredible.

00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:19.251 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
I use this pretty
much everything,

00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:23.055 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and I recommend this
also for people who want

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:24.523 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to use salad dressings.

00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:27.059 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I mean you can mix it with a
little organic balsamic vinegar

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:30.763 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and it makes a really
good replacement for stuff

00:25:30.763 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
like this, which is your toxic--

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: I bet that's MSG.

00:25:36.502 --> 00:25:40.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: MSG vegetable oil,
soybean oil, egg yolk, sugar,

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:44.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
salt, phosphoric acids,
steric acids, zanthum gum.

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:46.745 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I mean the list goes on
and on and on and on.

00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:48.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Hey, beware folks
of anything labeled ranch.

00:25:48.947 --> 00:25:53.352 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Ranch almost 100 percent
of the time contains MSG.

00:25:53.352 --> 00:25:56.622 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's just part of the
ranch flavor apparently.

00:25:56.622 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Now let's also talk
about soy sauce.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.227 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Here's, this is La
Choy brand and I happen

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:03.495 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to be sensitive to MSG.

00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:07.433 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I can't eat regular soy
sauce, even the other brands.

00:26:07.433 --> 00:26:09.735 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I'm
sensitive to MSG too.

00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:12.671 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Everybody's sensitive to MSG and
a lot of people don't even know

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:13.705 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
when they're eating it.

00:26:13.705 --> 00:26:14.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Mike: This is a
solution right here.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.143 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It's called raw coconut
aminos and this is,

00:26:18.143 --> 00:26:20.646 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
this is the company
here, Coconut Secret.

00:26:20.646 --> 00:26:22.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
This is the only soy
sauce that I can eat

00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:25.050 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
without getting a
headache and I was so happy

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to make this discovery, that's
why I want to share it with you,

00:26:27.453 --> 00:26:29.588 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
coconut aminos, that's
the solution.

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:33.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I guess it doesn't have the
free glutamates or glutamic acid

00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:35.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in it that the other
soy sauces have.

00:26:35.394 --> 00:26:37.529 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: So it's not
technically a soy sauce.

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:38.297 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, it's
not a soy sauce.

00:26:38.297 --> 00:26:39.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: It's a--

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:40.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Mike: It's from coconuts.

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:40.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Soy
sauce replacement.

00:26:40.666 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.668 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: But
I'll tell you what.

00:26:42.668 --> 00:26:43.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
When I saw that Mike
brought this in,

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I was like that's
amazing because I'm going

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:45.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to have to get some of that.

00:26:45.971 --> 00:26:49.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I like to cook some of
the Asian dishes and stuff

00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:51.143 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and we need a-- this is amazing.

00:26:51.143 --> 00:26:54.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I mean I would recommend
everybody get rid of the soy

00:26:54.847 --> 00:26:58.417 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
in their kitchen,
all soy products.

00:26:58.417 --> 00:26:59.485 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:26:59.485 --> 00:27:00.586 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Because
all soy products,

00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:01.587 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
unless they're organic,
are going to be GMO.

00:27:01.587 --> 00:27:02.988 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right, they're
going to be GMO.

00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:04.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And by the way, if you want to
get some of this coconut aminos,

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:05.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
you better go out and
buy it now because now

00:27:05.757 --> 00:27:07.993 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that we mentioned it, there's
not that much available.

00:27:07.993 --> 00:27:09.561 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's kind of a short
supply item.

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:11.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Especially small
companies that are trying

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:14.700 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
to make a difference and trying
to give us natural replacements

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
for all these toxic compounds.

00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:17.503 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Exactly.

00:27:17.503 --> 00:27:19.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
All right, Dr. Pepper,
this is just a stand

00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:21.373 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in for any random soda.

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:23.775 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Instead of drinking
soda in a can,

00:27:23.775 --> 00:27:25.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
how about La Crois [phonetic].

00:27:25.511 --> 00:27:29.515 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This is just a lemon
flavor sparkling water.

00:27:29.515 --> 00:27:34.253 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You know, it replaces soda,
it's a similar experience.

00:27:34.253 --> 00:27:37.022 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A lot of the soda addiction
is not the soda itself,

00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:39.424 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
but all the things that go with
it, you're opening the can,

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:42.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the fizz, the, you know, the
holding the aluminum can,

00:27:42.628 --> 00:27:44.396 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the coldness of it,
all these things.

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:46.064 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And this soda helps,

00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:49.701 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
this natural sparkling water I
should say, helps simulate that

00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:51.036 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but there's no aspartame,

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:52.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
there's no high fructose
corn syrup

00:27:52.638 --> 00:27:54.606 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and there's no phosphoric
acid in it.

00:27:54.606 --> 00:27:57.309 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So you're eliminating all
those potential toxins.

00:27:57.309 --> 00:27:59.845 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yeah, you know,
talking about phosphoric acid

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:04.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and MSG and aspartame, those
are all high excitotoxins.

00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:10.022 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Those excitotoxins cause extreme
damage on the brain tissue

00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:12.558 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and nobody can really
tell you what happens

00:28:12.558 --> 00:28:14.760 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
when you put multiple
excitotoxins

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:19.798 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in except it can exacerbate
by up to 5,000 percent.

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:22.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Speaking of
excitotoxins, I have a jar

00:28:22.568 --> 00:28:23.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of MSG here, pure MSG.

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:24.803 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
This is real.

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:27.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
This is not even
contrived or anything.

00:28:27.673 --> 00:28:29.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
That's real MSG.

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We've also got real
pure aspartame here,

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:37.049 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
laboratory quality supplies
here that we've got.

00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:39.151 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And in fact, I've
got these specimens

00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:41.019 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
for testing in the lab.

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:44.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Now the replacement for
aspartame is of course Stevia.

00:28:44.156 --> 00:28:46.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So here's a Stevia bottle.

00:28:46.525 --> 00:28:51.096 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This is actually a now foods
certified organic Stevia

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Extract, very simple
to use, replaces sugar

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.134 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and other artificial sweeteners.

00:28:56.134 --> 00:28:57.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I use it all the time.

00:28:57.402 --> 00:28:59.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: Yes,
I mean the thing is,

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:03.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
there are natural replacements
out there and MSG is used

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:06.011 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in practically everything
you have in your kitchen.

00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And when you go out
to restaurants too,

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.683 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
be sure to always ask
for natural replacements.

00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:14.386 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Choose restaurants
that use natural salts.

00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:17.122 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Choose restaurants
that don't use MSG.

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:19.291 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Choose restaurants that
don't have toxic things.

00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:21.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
One thing we didn't
even cover is ketchup.

00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:23.862 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I mean, ketchup is everywhere

00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:25.864 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and that's just pure
high fructose corn syrup

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:28.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and it just causes all
kinds of damage to the body.

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:30.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:32.738 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You can get ketchup without
high fructose corn syrup now,

00:29:32.738 --> 00:29:33.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
you know, natural ketchup.

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:36.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I think Annie's makes a
natural ketchup as well.

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:37.542 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Anyway, we did a great job, Ed.

00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:40.879 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
We cleared the table, we covered
all the replacements and I hope

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:43.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that we shared some good
information that you can use

00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:46.151 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in making choices in your
own food in your own home.

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:47.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Group: I mean
now it's up to you.

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:49.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I mean now it's time to just
go through your kitchen,

00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:53.458 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
go through your area, you know,
and not only go through it

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:56.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and replace the toxic
substances with non-toxic,

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:59.131 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
but teach your family
how to read labels.

00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:00.499 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Mike: Thanks for
watching Secrets to Health.

00:30:00.499 --> 00:30:01.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
Take care.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:07.572 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:23%
